<p>The <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/marken/icebreaker/">Icebreaker</a> MerinoLOFT Helix Zip Jacket for Women arrived in the beginning of the year here at the Hiking in Finland HQ and has seen daily use over the winter, spring and rather cool summer months since. It’s designed as an insulation garment that works on its own or under a shell layer, and is filled with 100% Merino wool as insulation, what Icebreaker calls <em>Merino Loft</em>. What’s special about this insulation is that it it is recycled icebreaker Merino wool on the inside, while the outside is made from recycled polyester, which makes this also a more environmentally friendly choice than other insulation layers (wool is degradable and a natural fibre, whereas synthetic insulation materials are not). The shell also has a light DWR treatment and sheds light rain. On the inside a soft wool heather lining makes for a comfortable feeling.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/20292582069/in/dateposted/" title="Icebreaker W&#x27;s Helix Jacket"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/419/20292582069_feefb22bfc_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Icebreaker W&#x27;s Helix Jacket" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>That’s the materials, but also the cut is functional, not to mention the details. The jacket has good freedom of movement, with stretchy side panels that also help with breathability. Thumbloops keep wrists warm and the sleeves in place, zippered pockets on the outside warm up hands or store small items, and the zippered inside pocket has also a cable exit for listening music on the go. The collar keeps cold wind from your neck and the hem has a drawstring so the generated warmth can not escape.</p>

<p>The jacket was been worn outdoors from March till now, and has seen lots &amp; lots of use - and still looks great. It’s not as warm as other insulation materials like down so you’ll need to move (a bit, like light hiking) to be warm in it, but on the positive side once you for example enter a hut you don’t need to immediately need to take the jacket off or overheat like in a down jacket. If you’re mostly static in really, really cold weather then the jacket might not be the best, but if you move a lot in cold temperatures then you’ll love it. The side panels tend to have a minimum amount of pilling, especially on the inside. This does not bother in use and is to be expected from the material. </p>

<p>All in all the jacket has made the wearer very happy. The MerinoLOFT Helix Zip Jacket is stylish and warm, with useful details for hiking &amp; everyday use. You can wear it without problems in town and don’t look like you’re just coming from the Karakorum, but also stay warm in -8°C in winter when you’re building a snow castle. If it gets colder or snows/ rains a lot it feels good under a hardshell, but woks best when worn on its own. </p>

Then this Dressing Guide will help you to create a warm, safe, comfortable and effective layering system for your winter outdoor activities. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/12436803535/" title="Layering Teaser"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5479/12436803535_f397e7fa39_b.jpg" width="1024" height="398" alt="Layering Teaser 2" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Dressing in layers is not difficult.</strong> The most important thing with is that you need to learn to take off or put on a layer depending on how warm or cold you feel - it’s something one really needs to take care of, as often one does not want to stop to dress up/ down. But by doing so you either get very cold or very hot &amp; sweaty, both situations you can avoid by being determined to keep this simple guideline in mind: <em>When you’re running hot, take a layer off. When you’re running cold, put on a layer.</em> I actually like to be a tad on the cool side, this way I’m not over-heating. And once you’re familiar with this, you can slowly start to dress up/ down <em>before</em> you’re too hot/ cold.</p>

<h2 id="base-layer">Base layer</h2>

<p>Task: <em>To wick away sweat and keep you warm &amp; dry.</em></p>

<p>My baselayer choice for skiing, hiking &amp; ice climbing is Merino wool. I value its qualities - non-smelly, warm when moist, comfortable on the skin - over other choices. The <a href="http://www.partioaitta.fi/tuotehaku/aclima">Aclima Woolnet</a> baselayers I have are superb and really some of the warmest &amp; lightest baselayers I have used. The two pieces - the long john and crew neck - work very well together. The top has a long back and reliably keeps the cold away - nothing is more annoying than tops with a short back, as just when you bent over to close your ski’s binding the wind will blow snow on your exposed back. These two garments are also durable, and six months of constant use - often being worn a week at a time - had thus far no effect on them.</p>

<p><img style="max-width:100%" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//cdn.thinglink.me/api/image/489465133949517824/1024/10/scaletowidth#tl-489465133949517824;1043138249" /><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//cdn.thinglink.me/jse/embed.js"></script></p>

<p>Alternatives: <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2010/02/gear-talk-woolpower-merino-awesomeness.html">Woolpower baselayers</a> are superb and I value their garments highly. I also have used <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2009/09/gear-talk-smartwool-microweight-zip-t-bottoms-initial-review.html">Smartwool baselayers</a> and liked them. </p>

<h2 id="mid-layer">Mid layer</h2>

<p>Task: <em>Transport sweat further away form the skin, add insulation and protect to some degree from the elements.</em></p>

<p>As simple as the base layer is, so versatile are the choices for the midlayer. This layer is by far the most depending on your own physique, metabolism, and what you’re doing outdoors. Lets start with the simple choices: A pants and midlayer top.</p>

<p><img style="max-width:100%" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//cdn.thinglink.me/api/image/489465124558471168/1024/10/scaletowidth#tl-489465124558471168;1043138249" /><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//cdn.thinglink.me/jse/embed.js"></script></p>

<p>I have been using the <a href="http://bit.ly/1iRkzXC">Outdoor Research Lodestar Pants</a> now for the second winter and really like them. Before that I wore shell pants, but in strong winds these were way too cold - the shell material would push directly against my thighs and thanks to the wonders of thermal conduction I would get very cold legs. The Lodestar Pants on the other hand has a wonderfully warm Powershield High Loft lining, that’s that fluffy fleece material which traps warmth and feels great on the skin. It’s a top-notch pants that I have been using for skiing, hiking, cycling and snow-shoeing, with ventilation zippers at the top, accessible pockets and removable suspenders. Most of all, the Polartec Powershield Pro shell keeps wind and to some extent moisture at bay, so those windy days of the past are no problem anymore. The second easy pick is the <a href="http://rab.uk.com/products/mens-clothing/baselayer/baseline-hoodie.html">Rab Baseline Hoody</a> (<a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2012/11/hoodylicious.html">Review here</a>). It’s warm, light and wicks sweat fantastically away.</p>

<p><img style="max-width:100%" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//cdn.thinglink.me/api/image/489465141834809344/1024/10/scaletowidth#tl-489465141834809344;1043138249" /><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//cdn.thinglink.me/jse/embed.js"></script></p>

<p>The above two are excellent choices for your average (-10°C air temperature) winter day, but when you’re the cold type then an additional garment is nice for extra warmth. Enter the <a href="http://bit.ly/1eJMrhR">Woolpower 400 Vest</a>: A Merino wool vest of the same great material of the Woolpower baselayers. A vest, because that way your torso - the important area to keep warm, with all them organs there - stays nicely warm, while the usually not that warmth-needing arms aren’t over-insulated. Plus, it saves weight and you can cool down over the arms.</p>

<p><img style="max-width:100%" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//cdn.thinglink.me/api/image/489465136717758464/1024/10/scaletowidth#tl-489465136717758464;1043138249" /><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//cdn.thinglink.me/jse/embed.js"></script></p>

<p>However, if it’s really cold (anything lower than -20°C air temperature) or you’re just the freezing type, a synthetic insulation layer like the <a href="http://bit.ly/1cp8TXG">Patagonia Nano Puff Hoody</a> over the Rab Baseline Hoody can add a tremendous amount of warmth. This is for me more of a belay/ short break jacket, but if it has been freezing cold it’s nice to wear a synthetic puffy as an additional midlayer to stay warm.</p>

<p><img style="max-width:100%" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//cdn.thinglink.me/api/image/489465106309054464/1024/10/scaletowidth#tl-489465106309054464;1043138249" /><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//cdn.thinglink.me/jse/embed.js"></script></p>

<p>The other side of the coin are people that run so warm, they often hike even in -15°C only in their baselayer top. I’m certainly not that type, but when for example trailrunning in winter I wear the <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/ortovox-andermatt-vest-blue-ocean-gr-s/?pid=81">ORTOVOX Andermatt Vest</a>. It’s a softshell/ merino-lined vest that keeps the wind away and the Merino wool lining helps to wick sweat further away from my skin. It is an ideal piece for XC skiing, too. </p>

<p>Alternatives: Dozens. See past <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/gear-reviews/">reviews</a> for ideas and this <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/magazin/black-diamond-dawn-patrol-pants-test/?pid=81">Black Diamond Dawn Patrol Touring Pants</a> review.</p>

<h2 id="shell-layer">Shell layer</h2>

<p>Task: <em>To keep the elements at bay.</em></p>

<p>The shell layer is nowadays also not as straight-forward anymore as it has been in the past - you have three choices for it: Windjacket, Softshell or Hardshell. For fast-paced activities - trailrunning and XC skiing, for example - a windjacket is a superb choice if it isn’t snowing. I have used the <a href="https://www.norrona.com/en-GB/Products/4326-12/3440/bitihorn-aero100-jacket-m/">Norrona bitihorn aero100 Jacket</a> for the last half year, and before that the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2011/09/rab-cirrus-wind-top.html">Rab Cirrus</a> and <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2010/07/arc-teryx-squamish-hoody-first-look.html">Arc’teryx Squamish</a>. All three are great pieces for keeping the wind away and as you should already have a windjacket, you can further extend its usage and don’t need to buy an extra garment.</p>

<p><img style="max-width:100%" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//cdn.thinglink.me/api/image/489476046127628288/1024/10/scaletowidth#tl-489476046127628288;1043138249" /><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//cdn.thinglink.me/jse/embed.js"></script></p>

<p>If you’re more of the cold type, or quickly-running hot type, then you might want to try out a softshell. I have used a handful of softshell jackets for all sorts of outdoor shenanigans, and really like the fit &amp; functions of the <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/mountain-equipment-trojan-hooded-jacke-nautilus-gr-s/?pid=81">Mountain Equipment Trojan Jacket</a>. This Windstopper softshell has a wonderful athletic cut and is extremely durable, and keeps snow and rain outside while being pretty breathable. I just wish it would not have Pitzips!</p>

<p><img style="max-width:100%" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//cdn.thinglink.me/api/image/489476051315982336/1024/10/scaletowidth#tl-489476051315982336;1043138249" /><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//cdn.thinglink.me/jse/embed.js"></script></p>

<p>And then the wind picks up, it starts to snow, and you’re bushwacking through the forest. Time for a hardshell. I have used the <a href="http://www.outdoorline.sk/en/176-westcomb-switch-lt-hoody-jacket.html">Westcomb Switch LT Hoody</a> now for the second year, and do like this NeoShell jacket. It breathes well, keeps all the nasty weather away and lets you arrive dry at camp. A good hood, excellent Napoleon pockets and nice elastic Velcro cuffs make this a very good hardshell for your layering system. But again, it’d be perfect without Pitzips!</p>

<p><img style="max-width:100%" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//cdn.thinglink.me/api/image/489465138617778176/1024/10/scaletowidth#tl-489465138617778176;1043138249" /><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//cdn.thinglink.me/jse/embed.js"></script></p>

<p>Alternatives: The <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2010/12/hagl-fs-ozo-pullover-review.html">Haglöfs OZO</a> still features the best hood, ever. The <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2010/11/rab-demand-pull-on-review.html">Rab Demand Pull-On</a> and <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2009/11/gear-talk-rab-momentum-jacket-drillium-pants.html">Rab Momentum Jacket</a> are excellent eVent garments, while the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2011/04/golite-tumalo-storm-jacket-pants.html">GoLite Tumalo Storm Jacket</a>, made of Pertex Shield, is also an alternative.</p>

<h2 id="insulation-layer">Insulation layer</h2>

<p>Task: <em>To add a lot of warmth when moving little &amp; being stationary.</em></p>

<p>You make a long break, have arrived at camp or the belay, and now will be moving very little and hence generate very little warmth. Time to put on the insulation layer. You can not beat down for the weight-to-warmth ratio, and as this piece will likely sit most of the time in your backpack while you’re skiing, hiking or snow-shoeing, a lightweight jacket is in my opinion preferable. The <a href="http://bit.ly/1lWAMzZ">Rab Infinity Down Jacket</a> has been with me for three seasons and has done a very good job. It’s light, warm, has a good hood and pockets, and thanks to the water-resistant and windproof shell material snow and wind are no problem for it. It also packs reasonably small, so is a great option for the weight- and space conscious.</p>

<p><img style="max-width:100%" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//cdn.thinglink.me/api/image/489476030344462337/1024/10/scaletowidth#tl-489476030344462337;1043138249" /><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//cdn.thinglink.me/jse/embed.js"></script></p>

<p>Alternatives: I love the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2010/11/kl-ttermusen-loke-review.html">Klättermusen Loke</a>, a superb down pullover. Also the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2011/04/sir-joseph-koteka-down-jacket.html">Sir Joseph Koteka Down Jacket</a> has kept me nice and warm in very cold weather.</p>

<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap-up</h2>

<p>That’s it. As you saw (and see underneath again), dressing warm for winter is easy. To repeat:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Base layer - <em>To wick away sweat and keep you warm &amp; dry.</em></li>
  <li>Mid layer - <em>Transport sweat further away form the skin, add insulation and protect to some degree from the elements.</em></li>
  <li>Shell layer - <em>To keep the elements at bay.</em></li>
  <li>Insulation layer - <em>To add a lot of warmth when moving little &amp; being stationary.</em></li>
</ol>

<p>If you dress this way your next winter adventure should be warm, comfortable and safe. If you start from scratch with your layering system, a good baselayer and midlayer are the best 1st investments, while you can make use of the same shell layer you use in the warm seasons. A warm insulation layer is only really necessary if you’re doing long day trips where you will have breaks outside or spend the night outdoors - although in the mountains it is a recommended safety piece to have in case of sudden weather changes. You also can use a not that thick puffy jacket for starters, and see if it fulfils the role.</p>

<p>And remember: <em>When you’re running hot, take a layer off. When you’re running cold, put on a layer.</em></p>

<p>Pants =/= Pants. I didn’t think so in the beginning, but have realized through much experience since that lighter pants are a lot more comfortable than <em>“heavy”</em> pants. I don’t have objective proof that they make you hike faster and better, but a well fitting, light pants just makes the hiking in my experience more comfortable. All pants underneath I have picked with durability, windproofness, comfort and quick-drying in mind and they’ve seen years of use, so if you’re looking for a new pair of pants - check these out! <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/sets/72157629182054730/">More photos of all pants on Flickr</a>.</p>

<p>My go-to pants since they arrived three years ago. Have they held up well in those years? Absolutely. The only damage to them is a tiny burn hole in the leg as I was sitting too close to the fire and a spark burned through it, but other than that they’re still in tip-top shape. And I haven’t been kind to them: Backpacking, bouldering, climbing, bikepacking, hiking, and because they’re so comfortable I’ve also worn them during “normal” activities whenever I could get away with it. All pockets are zipped which is superb, because that way your phone, wallet, keys and whatnot stays inside and doesn’t fall out of your pocket while you hike, run, climb or sit. They are absolutely windproof, dry very quickly, are a slim fit and very minimalistic in their appearance so fit well under a pair of rain pants. </p>

<p>The Thorofare pants get’s a honourable mention - not because it’s the lightest pants I own, but because it ain’t available anymore (unless you happen to pick one up on Gear Swap). Windproof, light like a feather, quick drying, two pockets and two cargo pockets, and an elastic “belt” to keep the pants up (don’t overload those pockets thus). In hot environments where there’s no wind going they might be a tad hot, but other than that they’re excellent. If you can get your hands on one, get a pair for those SUL trips where the lightest pants is what you want.</p>

<p>The second-most worn pants, the <a href="http://rab.uk.com/">Rab</a> Traverse pants also sports zipped pockets, which in my book is always good as it is just a bit safer. It has a push-button closure, which is very comfortable and is bomb-proof. UPF 35 gives plenty of UV protection for your legs, and if you only carry one pant and want to wash it on the trail - the Traverse pants will be dry again in no time. A very comfortable fit that’s also excellent for acrobatic climbing moves, this is a pants that is great in the backcountry as well as in town. </p>

<p><em>A Zip-off pants?</em> Yes! <em>Why?</em> Because in very hot &amp; humid environments I like shorts. So instead of trapping my athletic calves in polyamide, I let them taste the sun and wind. It’s getting too windy? Just zip them back on. Patagonia was extremely smart when making the zippers for this pants: They’re two different colours, so no more mixing up left &amp; right legs. Also this pant is durable, windproof and dries very fast, and if you walk a lot in environments where the weather lets you wear shorts during the day while in the evenings a long pair of pants is preferable, check these out.</p>

<p><em>Fjällräven pants?</em> Yes, because I still own a pair. The defacto standard trouser for the outdoors man &amp; women population in Scandinavia, it feels like it’s the pants you gotta wear when you go to the Fjell. I thought so too when I was a young grasshopper, but not anymore. If you waxed them before you head out they’re OK waterproof-ish, though they will soak through in a deluge just as much as the other pants above. And then they need more time to dry. They got seven pockets, which would mean an SUL backpacker could just carry his gear in this pants. I also needed a belt with these pants, as the sizing of them is even in the smallest size too big for me.</p>

<p>There are a lot more pants - but I haven’t worn them and hence can’t judge them. The most worn ones for me are the Arc’teryx and Rab pants, as I like their zippered pockets, I know that they’re super-durable and allow enough movement for climbing and bouldering, they’re windproof and dry quickly if they get wet. Oh, and they look both also rather good! <strong>What are your favourite lightweight pants?</strong></p>

<p>If you look for the lightest shirt with the best environmental credentials and great looks, then you won’t need to look further than the Patagonia Capilene 1 Silkweight T-Shirts. I love mine and its probably my most-worn shirt if I hit the trail. It dries in mere minutes in the sun, the funk (<em>that’s informal American English for smelly</em>) is minimal and 15-UPF sun protection keeps you from burning (although it could be more). It’s surprisingly durable for being so light, climbing and bushwacking didn’t pull a single thread from it, and it’s been in use since two years already. It feels very good on the skin and you’ll look good with this shirt on the trail as well as walking the dog in town.  My go-to shirt, if it’s not in the wash!</p>

<p>This shirt has been updated since I got it (it’s the problem of testing gear long-term, ya see!) and now sports mesh underarm panels, which does seem like a very nice improvement. However, my “old” shirt is still looking good as it is quite durable. It’s a good looking shirt, though after a few days wearing it on the trail it needs a wash as the guff (that’s informal Scottish for smelly) is tangible. It’s UPF Rating of 50+ keeps your skin aristocratic white, while the flatlocked seams add much comfort to the wearing experience. The fabric comes in a bunch of nice colours, and once you’ve hiked up a mountain in 35°C and the shirt is drenched in your sweat the fabric’s quick-drying capabilities will kick in and you’ll have a dry shirt in no time (well, maybe about 10 to 15 minutes).</p>

<p>A shirt made of <em>ethically sourced Australian Merino wool and recycled polyester with Cocona technology</em> which has gotten a lot of positive reviews. I have found them great shirts, the 120g/m² fabric is light and dries very fast, rivalling the synthetic shirts above. They do pill a bit, but it’s just a cosmetic thing and doesn’t affect it’s durability. Speaking off, I used mine for climbing, hiking, cycling and everyday use for over 12 months, and they still look great. The reflective details are a nice touch which cyclists and pedestrians will appreciate, and the flatlock seams make them comfortable to wear. They also do not easily smell, I can wear mine for five days and more and they still don’t reek. If you’re looking for the best of both worlds - that’s merino &amp; synthetic combined - then you’ve found it with Rab’s MeCo garments. Here’s more <a href="http://rab.uk.com/reference/technology/baselayer/meco.html">info on Cocona</a> if you’re of the curious kind.</p>

<p>The same material and properties than the Rab MeCo 120 Tee above, I have used this longsleeve on colder days in spring and autumn, and as a layering piece in winter. Because it dries so fast it is in winter quite nice to wear, but not on its own - an Aclima Woolnet longsleeve underneath it is a great combination. Also for summer use, if you want to protect your arms a bit more from the sun or easily get cold in a stiff breeze, this longsleeve fits the bill. </p>

<p>It’s a fancy name, but then it’s a fancy shirt as well! The only 100% Merino summer shirt in my closet at the moment, this is a great T-shirt in so many respects: Even after a week on the trail it doesn’t reek (maybe just a tiny bit), it dries reasonably fast (slower than the synthetic shirts, though), it’s very comfortable on the skin and it too looks superb. Where the synthetic shirts dry fast, the Merino one needs a bit longer to get dry, though that also can be a benefit if you’re hiking in sweltering heat - in that case the shirt provides a bit more cooling. If you’re hiking on a trail where you’ll be in the company of a lot of other people (staying in huts, for example) this one might be your best choice - you’ll smell less and look good =)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The venerable hoody - a longsleeved shirt with an attached hood. It’s a great garment because you can never lose your hood - unlike your hat or cap - and thus always have something to keep your neck and head warm. It’s great between spring and autumn, when it allows you to leave your sleeping hat at home; but really shines in winter, when cold wind and sub-zero temperatures dig into your skin and you’re happy to pull that hood over your head and zip it closed, so that there’s less skin exposed to the elements. </p>

<p><strong>Five different Hoodys compared. Cthulhu approved.</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/smartwool-midweight-hoody-wollhoody/">Smartwool Midweight Hoody</a> appeared last year in La Maison Morkel, and has been worn a lot since. Skiing, hiking, cycling, walking with my son - it’s a trusty companion between September and May. Made of 100% Merino Wool it hugs you with all that soft warmness, as if you’re lying down next to one of them fine Merino Sheep who donated its wool to make it. The Merino used is a thicker weave than in the BPL Beartooth, which makes it 37 gram heavier - and a lot warmer. The hood is great, it has thumbloops, and a deep zipper for good ventilation when you’re running warm. The thumbloops are the best in my opinion, they warm your hands up quickly, are super-comfortable and easily layer over/ under gloves. My favourite Merino hoody for winter.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://rojk.se/index.php/en/tvister-helmet-hood-3">Tvister Helmet Hood</a> from Röjk has my favourite hood from the bunch; it thus is no surprise that it won the <em>Best Design and Innovation at the Innovation for Extremes Awards</em>, too. It’s a damn fine hood, creating a nice tunnel and thus more protection from wind, snow and rain; and unlike its brethern in this article, doesn’t hang down your back when you’re not wearing it, but stands nicely there, keeping your neck warm. I lament the absence of thumbloops, though Jan assured me that in the next reincarnation it will have those. No zip means no venting, but their unique Tvister Fabric - a <em>half-layer insulation</em> fabric is supposed to keep your temperature just right, which is not the case for me - I just run warm and to cool down need to open the outer layer. They’re ethically made in Europe, and come in swell colours. My favourite hoody for day hikes.</p>

<p>The Rab <a href="http://rab.uk.com/products/mens-clothing/baselayer/baseline-hoodie.html">Baseline Hoodie</a> is a hoody made from Polartec Power Dry. That’s a mad material, let me tell you: It wicks the moistness away from your skin, and even if the complete garment is drenched in your sweat, you feel dry. I was utterly surprised when I undressed after some skiing last winter to find out that I felt dry, but that the outsode of the hoody was moist. Genius. The zippered chest pocket keeps an energy bar or two, the zip goes acceptably deep for ventilating, just the thumbloops could be improved - they’re OK, but not as comfy as others here. If I go out skiing in winter, this is the hoody I’m most likely wearing.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8170159564/" title="Silkbody Cellular Pilot Top by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7113/8170159564_f654efa13c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Silkbody Cellular Pilot Top" /></a></p>

<p>For over two years I hike, ski &amp; snowshoe in this hoody, and there have been a lot of questions about it. The <a href="http://www.silkbody.co.nz/man/outdoor/cellular-pilot-top-men-only.html">Silkbody Cellular Pilot Top</a> has a lot of great details going for it: sunglasses slots, off-centre front zip, thumb loops, flat seams and a ninja hood. It’s also unique because it made from 80% Silk (and 20% Merino), making for a comfortable feeling. It keeps you warm when you need it to, and cool when the heat would allow you to fry eggs in your Ti pan (without fire). The superb Ninja hoody goes over your nose, so no need for a Balaclava with this one; and thanks to the off-centre zip and stormflap behind it nothing rubs against your skin. An year-round usable hoody, though in deep winter it needs something extra over it.</p>

<p>The out-of-production BPL Beartooth Hoody is probably THE ultralight hoody. It’s a lovely garment, and there isn’t really a hoody available yet that has replaced it. It’s a thin and fine Merino weave, but surprisingly warm - though I’d not wear it in deep winter, to be honest. But I find it perfect from spring to autumn, where it is the perfect package - a deep zip for venting, thumbloops for extra warmth, and a good hood which also works great for sleeping. It’s my pick for cold spring and autumn trips. If you’re able to get one, take it!</p>

<h2 id="the-ultimate-hoody">The Ultimate Hoody</h2>

<p>The Ultimate Hoody is ethically made (wherever, but fair wages are paid and working conditions are excellent) from renewable and recyclable materials. It wicks the sweat away like the Rab Baseline Hoody, has the thumbloops of the Smartwool Midweight Hoody, looks as good as the Silkbody Cellular Pilot Top and makes use of their off-centre zip (which will be deeper for better venting) and combines their Ninja hood with the Röjk Tvister’s hood. It’s as light as the BPL Beartooth, and comes in a host of fresh colours.</p>
