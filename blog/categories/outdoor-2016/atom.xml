    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A new approach to OutDoor News posts this year, with a look at different categories instead of brands. Starting of with everyone’s favourite: Stoves!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28273014340/in/dateposted/" title="Fjällräven"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8566/28273014340_deff01d426_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Fjällräven" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I didn’t find too many new stoves this year, which I blame on my severely limited time at the show to walk around and visit the different booths. But at least I managed to see and play with two stoves on the fair, of which I found the <strong>Jetboil MightyMo</strong> the more interesting one. At 95 g it certainly isn’t the lightest stove around, especially if you factor in an additional windscreen and pot, but if we look at the stove only we see it is actually a pretty powerful little thing. It packs 10.000 BTU which is around 3.000 Watt in case these matters to you, in practice it means you can boil water &amp; melt snow at high altitude - although the reliable regulator is more responsible for that. It has a Piezo ignition which is comfortable and nice in use, and the output can be finely adjusted allowing you to simmer, cook or just boil. It is compatible with the <a href="http://bit.ly/2at9tLU">Jetboil FluxRing pans</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/2aqgAXf">pots</a> which have heat exchangers and works well with them. The MightyMo should retail in Europe for 59€ next year, while US Americans already will be able to buy it in the autumn.</p>

<p>The <strong>MSR PocketRocket 2</strong> combines the MicroRocket’s light weight with the durability and quick boil time of the PocketRocket and also is more compact and stable as its predecessor. It is now 73 g light, 20% smaller as the original and boils one litre of water in 3,5 minutes. The new pot supports accommodate a wider range of pot sizes. No info on output, price and how reliable it would work at high altitude.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28450555872/in/dateposted/" title="MSR Pocket Rocket 2"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8753/28450555872_484d88fdaf_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="MSR Pocket Rocket 2" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28450555672/in/dateposted/" title="MSR Pocket Rocket 2"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8169/28450555672_544682e074_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="MSR Pocket Rocket 2" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>So much on stoves, lets stay with MSR and look at the new <strong>TrailShot Microfilter</strong>. Made for trailrunners &amp; hikers who do not want to carry much water on their runs &amp; hikes, this filter is a combination of a hose and filter. It’s pretty easy to use: Drop the hose into the water source - a stream in the mountains, a lake in the woods or even a puddle - and then squeeze the filter. The squeezing sucks water into the filter, and at the front, mouth piece clean &amp; filtered water comes out. The filter takes out Protozoa and bacteria, and weighs 142 g for the Filter &amp; Hose. The flow rate of 1 litre per minute is reasonably fast and you can treat up to 2.000 l of water with it. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28450556132/in/dateposted/" title="MSR TrailShot Microfilter"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8596/28450556132_1793a116b7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="MSR TrailShot Microfilter" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>In my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/07/outdoor-2016-first-gear-teasers.html">teaser post</a> I already looked at the <strong>Katadyn BeFree</strong> and it was cool to see one in action at the fair. It’s a nifty setup that weighs only 55 g including the 0,5 l Hydrapak Softflask. The filter is easy to clean and has a high output rate. The filter itself is good for 1.000 l of dirty water, then you can replace the filter unit for 35€ - given that the whole package is 45€ it’s a bit expensive for just the filter me thinks, but if your Softflask is still OK why replace it? Rumours on the show floor have it that there will be bigger flasks coming in 2017 as well as a possible system, but as the filter does already fit on bigger Hydrapak softflasks you could just use on of these already.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28557076125/in/photostream/" title="Katadyn BeFree"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8839/28557076125_e24b4950fe_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Katadyn BeFree" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Do you like to make pretty night time photos of your illuminated tent under the Milky Way? Read a book before you turn it? Need some light to search something in your tent at night? Then the <strong>Petzl Noctilight</strong> might be something for you. Put your Petzl Headlamp in there during transport or at camp, put it on and it will diffuse the light beautifully for reading, searching and taking photos. It’s 85 g heavy, so if you’re an ultralight backpacker you need to ponder hard if it comes along, but for glamping it will be a great little accessory.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28273018650/in/dateposted/" title="Petzl Noctilight"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8572/28273018650_2f7a65181b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Petzl Noctilight" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28273018930/in/dateposted/" title="Petzl Noctilight"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8802/28273018930_e0b42e7711_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Petzl Noctilight" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28273019360/in/dateposted/" title="Petzl Noctilight"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8619/28273019360_9d267ba632_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Petzl Noctilight" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The <em>HYBRID design allows Petzl’s new compact headlamps to run off both the CORE rechargeable battery or three AAA/LR03 batteries, without an adapter. A practical and flexible solution that allows the user to take advantage of each of these energy sources, depending on use. Compatible with all TIKKINA, TIKKA, ZIPKA, ACTIK, ACTIK CORE, TACTIKKA, TACTIKKA+ and TACTIKKA +RGB headlamps.</em> The CORE rechargeable battery weighs 23 g and can be recharged via the USB port of your headlamp or directly, as the CORE also has a mini USB port.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28273017340/in/dateposted/" title="Petzl Hybrid battery"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7649/28273017340_89d1161484_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Petzl Hybrid battery" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The <strong>Petzl eLite</strong> comes back, this time around with 50 Lumen at 27 g of weight. It keeps the red light, strobes, the whistle in the back and is still powered by two Lithium CR032 batteries. It now also has the red carrying case included again, and has a recommended retail price of 25€. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28453267462/in/dateposted/" title="Petzl eLite"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8726/28453267462_4d19cd7388_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Petzl eLite" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Other Petzl headlamps have got minor updates - you know the drill: More lumen, new colours. But the <strong>Actik and Actik Core Headlamps</strong> are actually new and aimed at active people, or to be more precise as everyone that walks around outside in the dark is active: Active people who need lots of light and go fast. The Actik packs 300 Lumen and is designed for mountaineering, running, hiking and backpacking at night. It has red light for keeping your night vision, and reflective details on the headband make you visible to others outside in the dark. It works with the CORE rechargeable battery, weighs 90 g and should cost only 40€! The big brother Actik Core packs 350 Lumen, weighs only 80 g and costs only 55€. The CORE battery is included, hence the Core in the name. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28273018200/in/dateposted/" title="Petzl Actik and Actik Core Headlamps"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8785/28273018200_a8d455583c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Petzl Actik and Actik Core Headlamps" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Another light and rechargeable headlamp is the <strong>Black Diamond Iota</strong>. The 56 g light (and that’s including batteries) headlamp packs 150 Lumen and is powered by an lithium ion rechargeable battery which is loaded in three hours via USB. The Iota also has the PowerTap Technology which allows you to fast and simply transition between full and dimmed power, and a 3-level power meter shows the remaining battery life for three seconds after you switch on the headlamp. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28273011820/in/dateposted/" title="Black Diamond Iota"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8589/28273011820_0eaa8b11da_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Black Diamond Iota" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And finally a look at a new knife. The <strong>Morakniv Eldris</strong> is 76 g light for knife &amp; sheath (the knife itself is 60 g light) and lays beautifully in the hand. It’s gonna be available later in the autumn of this year, in five colours which show the general trend of colours for the next few years: More toned down &amp; earthy. This fixed blade does actually fit into your pocket and super versatile in use: Take it along hiking &amp; camping, use it as a safety knife when climbing or even take it hunting. The thermoplastic rubber on the handle ensures a safe grip of the little knife, which is 143 mm long in total. The blade is 56 mm long, which theoretically would even make it carry-on compliant, but I wouldn’t try that personally. You can use the back of the blade to strike a firesteel, and indeed the Eldris is available in a set with a lanyard and firesteel. I might do a more detailed review on this little friend in the future, as I already have one!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Can’t wait for ultralight gear news from the OutDoor 2016 anymore? I have you covered and show you a selection of new ultralight tents and backpacks, new shoes and apparel to make your hiking, climbing, backpacking and camping lighter! </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28115365671/in/dateposted/" title="#OutDoorFN 2016 is coming!"><img src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/8/7304/28115365671_6eee8bb41d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="1024" alt="#OutDoorFN 2016 is coming!" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>While the <a href="">OutDoor 2016</a> kicks off first in two days I already got a lot of information on new gear coming in 2017. Please keep in mind that I haven’t actually seen, touched or tested these items so all information are to be taken with a grain of salt and they still might change until they stand in stores in 2017. I will try to try on, lie in and walk in many of the items seen here while on the fair, but that also is just to get a taste of them and not a final judgement.</p>

<p>Instead of going by company in this teaser update, I will just go by categories. And as everyone loves tents and shelters, those make the start!</p>

<h2 id="tents--shelters">Tents &amp; Shelters</h2>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28202203836/in/dateposted/" title="Nordisk Lofoten 1 ULW"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8899/28202203836_45182594ba_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Nordisk Lofoten 1 ULW" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The <strong>Nordisk</strong> takes the Ultralight crown this year with the Lofoten 1 ULW, as it has a claimed weight of just 490 g with a pack size of 11 x 22 cm. It’s a two layer tent with mesh doors, aluminum poles, Dyneema cords and Titanium stakes, and a repair set is also included. No info on Price or if you can sit in it, which I hope to find out on the fair =)</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28158403041/in/dateposted/" title="Vaude Hogan SUL 1-2P"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7292/28158403041_8a334f8656_b.jpg" width="1024" height="788" alt="Vaude Hogan SUL 1-2P" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>Vaude</strong> is revamping their Hogan tents which are especially popular with cyclists. The Vaude Hogan SUL 1-2P will weigh around 1.100 g and has a size of 235 x 110 cm. The larger tents which sleep two and three are a bit more heavy and wider, and a new model called Invenio has two doors opposite of each other. All these tents will have 5 years of warranty on them, too.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/27955414880/in/dateposted/" title="Marmot Bolt 2P tent"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7580/27955414880_d37d27d22e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Marmot Bolt 2P tent" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Also <strong>Marmot</strong> comes out with a new lightweight tent. The Bolt 2P tent weighs 1.040 g and sleeps two. It will cost 500 € and will be in the shops from February 2017 onwards. The Specs: 20 D Polyester Fly, large entry, full mesh inner which can be pitched on its own on fine, mosquito-infested days, and there should be good sitting height.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/27622202004/in/dateposted/" title="MSR Advance Pro 2"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7465/27622202004_960a5ac09e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="767" alt="MSR Advance Pro 2" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>MSR</strong> launches a great looking Alpine/ Ultralight backpacking tent, the Advance Pro 2. It weighs 1.300 g packed and will retail for 585 € and should be available from Spring 2017. It has very durable Easton Syclone poles which are made from a carbon and aluminium composite. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28133567382/in/dateposted/" title="Therm-A-Rest Tranquility 6 Tent"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7308/28133567382_f5b719952b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="599" alt="Therm-A-Rest Tranquility 6 Tent" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And lastly <strong>Therm-A-Rest</strong> enters the Camping (Glamping!) Market with their Tranquility™ 4 and 6 tents. These weigh 5,19 kg and 7,87 kg respectively, sleep four or six people, have standing height and cost 530€ or 650€.</p>

<h2 id="backpacks--packs">Backpacks &amp; Packs</h2>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/27955415580/in/photostream/" title="GREGORY Paragon 48"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7320/27955415580_a36fa460e3_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="GREGORY Paragon 48" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The <strong>GREGORY</strong> Paragon 48 weighs 1.450 g and is one of several light-ish packs. The Paragon is the Male model while the Maven is the Women’s model. Available in four volumes from 38 l to 68 l these packs will cost between 160€ and 240€. It comes with an Aerolon carrying system which can be adjusted in length to your body and if you want to lighten it further up you can remove the top lid and use the inside compartment divider as one. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28158403401/in/photostream/" title="Vaude Zerum 48+ LW Backpack"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8623/28158403401_31584c1521_b.jpg" width="788" height="1024" alt="Vaude Zerum 48+ LW Backpack" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Zerum 48+ LW Backpack from <strong>Vaude</strong> concludes the German company’s step to offer lightweight versions for the big 3 (The <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/vaude-alpstein-450-down-decke/?pid=10239">Alpstein 450</a>, which I helped design &amp; test, launched last year). The pack comes in three sizes - 38 l, 48 l and 58 l. The medium 48 l pack weighs 1.180 g, has a PFC-free EcoFinish to let rain and dirt pearl off and is made from a light 70 D Rip-Stop. It has a light version of the Vaude Tergolight Carrying system.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/27959237640/in/dateposted/" title="Ortlieb Bikepacking Packs"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7317/27959237640_24dbd89364_b.jpg" width="1024" height="631" alt="Ortlieb Bikepacking Packs" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And <strong>Ortlieb</strong> enters the Bikepacking Framebag market (see my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/02/bikepacking-bag-manufacturers.html">Bikepacking Framebag Manufacturer List</a> to see smaller companies making custom and Multi-size bags). The German company launches a Framebag (which comes out next year) and a Handlebar bag and Seatbag, both which are already available. The Seatpack is 430 g light and costs 130€, while the Handlebar Bag is 417 g and costs 100€. The former has a volume of 5 to 16,5 l while the latter packs 15 l of gear, with an Accessory-Pack for the Handlebar pack (206 g and 55€) which adds 3,5 l more. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/27955807950/in/dateposted/" title="Petzl GriGri 2017"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8880/27955807950_30cd44dc42_b.jpg" width="1024" height="841" alt="Petzl GriGri 2017" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>Petzl</strong> seems to be launching a new GriGri - at least that’s my guess going by the above photo which was in my invite to their booth =) </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28236552315/in/dateposted/" title="Black Diamond Ropes"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7782/28236552315_c09b4b94c5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="695" alt="Black Diamond Ropes" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>Black Diamond</strong> enters the rope market. Available will be four different ropes: The 7,8 Half- and Twin-Rope, a 9,2 Triple Certified Rope and two Single Ropes in 9,6 and 9,9 diameter. They have a Full-Dry finish and will be available in lengths of 35 m, 40 m, 60 m and 70 m. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28132885632/in/dateposted/" title="Merrell Agility Peak Flex"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7330/28132885632_1916b41a48_b.jpg" width="1024" height="737" alt="Merrell Agility Peak Flex" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The new <strong>Merrell</strong> Agility Peak Flex above is a new trailrunning shoe which has the new FlexConnect midsole. A Hyperlock Heel construction should lock in your heel while the breathable mesh upper makes it a solid choice on hot days. The shoe has a drop of 6 mm, 5 mm deep lugs on the sole and is available from spring/ summer 2017 onwards.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28203030476/in/dateposted/" title="Scarpa Epic Lite OD"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8702/28203030476_116bcc28d8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="717" alt="Scarpa Epic Lite OD" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>From <strong>Scarpa</strong> comes the Epic Lite OD, with OD standing for OutDry, the waterproof-breathable membrane. It’s an approach shoe which should do well on Via Ferratas and hiking in the mountains. Again we have a Sock-Fit upper construction, and the laminated OutDry® membrane should keep your feet dry - from the inside and out. Underneath a Vibram Megagrip sole ensures you don’t slip away if its wet.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28237378245/in/dateposted/" title="Dachstein Spürsinn EVO"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/8/7426/28237378245_0d8bb01408_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Dachstein Spürsinn EVO" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>Dachstein</strong> is a new brand to me and their Spürsinn EVO shoe sounds really great. It has a sock-like, knitted shaft and has been developed with the blind mountaineer Andy Holzer. It is supposed to have a great feeling of what’s under your foot with the Vibram EVO 2.0 sole, and a shoe weighs 340 g in Size 42. The upper is made from mesh for breathability, and it has a climbing zone in the front which make sit good for Via Ferratas and approaches. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/27623441363/in/dateposted/" title="KEEN Versago"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8700/27623441363_e244f52796_b.jpg" width="990" height="1024" alt="KEEN Versago" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>KEEN</strong> is another new company for me and their Versago is a shoe that combines great looks for urban use and functional details which should make him great on your hikes and runs. The upper and tongue wrap around your foot like a sock and are made from mesh, while the midsole has the S3™-Technology which gives stability and cushioning on demanding terrain. It comes in four colours and will retail for 110€. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28206488956/in/dateposted/" title="Arc&#x27;teryx Norvan VT"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8724/28206488956_62d94be9cd_b.jpg" width="1024" height="165" alt="Arc&#x27;teryx Norvan VT" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The <strong>Arc’teryx</strong> Norvan VT is the latest shoe of the Canadians. This trailrunning shoe weighs 300 g in Men’s Size 8,5 UK or 320 g as a GTX shoe. The last 2/3 of the shoe have a Vibram Megagrip sole which ensures grip on wet &amp; dry terrain alike, while the front one-third has a Vibram Idrogrip sole which ensures you can scramble well on your Via Ferratas and approaches. Arc’teryx built the shoe for <em>alpinists and climbers who use trail running to increase their fitness, and dedicated trail runners looking for new territory to explore</em>. And the 360⁰ Support System should help you with that, as you can decrease the volume and ensure a climbing-like fit when you tighten it, and release it again for the running sections of the trail. They will cost 165€ for the non-lined version and 190€ for the GTX shoe, available from spring 2017 onwards.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/27955412350/in/photostream/" title="Marmot Airlite Jacket"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8668/27955412350_a66b834307_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Marmot Airlite Jacket" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>Marmot</strong> launches the Airlite Jacket which will make UL backpackers and trailrunners happy, as it only weighs 102 g - and will “only” cost 120€. Made from Nylon Ripstop Stretch it is stretchy so great for running in the rain. It is supposed to be very breathable and of course keeps wind and rain at bay, with a hood and a zippered pocket, too. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28158404561/in/photostream/" title="Vaude Zebru UL 3L Jacket"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7471/28158404561_db0eb2d21c_b.jpg" width="788" height="1024" alt="Vaude Zebru UL 3L Jacket" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The <strong>Vaude</strong> Zebru UL 3L Jacket weighs 198 g in Size L and is a hardshell with a PFC-free finish. It is made of a 3-layer Ceplex Pro-Membrane which should keep you dry and out of the wind and is also breathable. If that’s too heavy for you then the Zebru Windshell Jacket and the Zebru Windshell Vest which weigh 90 g and 70 g respectively might be more interesting!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28158406361/in/photostream/" title="Vaude - 95% PFC Free from 2017 onwards"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8620/28158406361_5d168437f4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Vaude - 95% PFC Free from 2017 onwards" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Another great news from <strong>Vaude</strong> is that 95% of their range will be PFC-free from 2017 onwards. They will use almost exclusively PFC-free DWRs on their jackets and already faced the harmful substances out in other areas of the manufacturing chain. Great news for users and the environment!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28203717286/in/dateposted/" title="OMM AVA Jacket Womens"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8841/28203717286_a2e3050061_b.jpg" width="1024" height="1024" alt="OMM AVA Jacket Womens" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And <strong>OMM</strong> launches the AVA Jacket, a sub-200 g fully featured mountain running jacket made from a new eVent DVSTORM 3 layer fabric. The OMM Team was focused on creating innovative closures around the wrist, waist and face and I am very much looking forward checking it out in person. It has an Dynamic Droptail to keep you bottoms a wee bit more dry in the rain, YKK Aquaguard zips and a newly designed Multi-Cuff. </p>

<h2 id="materials">Materials</h2>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/27959054270/in/dateposted/" title="THERMORE® ECODOWN®"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8824/27959054270_c78701c88d_b.jpg" width="961" height="453" alt="THERMORE® ECODOWN®" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>Thermore</strong> Ecodown is a synthetic down which is made completely from recycled PET bottles. It is available in 8 variations (60, 80, 100, 115, 130, 150, 170, 200 g/m2) and in 20 different thicknesses, allowing manufacturers to create your favourite puffy jacket with a environmentally friendly material. Available immediately I hope many companies will start to use this material soon. </p>

<h2 id="accessories">Accessories</h2>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/27956036160/in/dateposted/" title="Exped Care Line"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7454/27956036160_c186d35f27_b.jpg" width="850" height="710" alt="Exped Care Line" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>Exped</strong> launches their own Care Line products. Prices range from 3,95€ for the Down Cleaner to 8,95€ for the Tent Cleaner. Additionally there will be products for Gear Waterproofing, a Mat and Backpack Spray Cleaner and a Sleeping Bag Spray Cleaner. Expect them from March 2017 onwards.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28159489101/in/dateposted/" title="Katadyn BeFree"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/8/7330/28159489101_bacdf0c0e4_b.jpg" width="964" height="830" alt="Katadyn BeFree" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>Katadyn</strong> launches this September their BeFree Waterbottle &amp; Filter. The soft bottle has an integrated 0,1 Micron hollow fibre filter in it, which can be replaced. The soft flask is 0,5 l and from Hydrapak. Usage is super-simple: Fill the bottle, screw on the filter and drink! </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28239138305/in/dateposted/" title="Outdoor Tech Kodiak Plus 6"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8858/28239138305_93497e20f7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="1022" alt="Outdoor Tech Kodiak Plus 6" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Kodiak Plus 10 from <strong>Outdoor Tech</strong> is a 10k mAh Powerbank which weighs 308 g and will cost 80€. The Lithium battery is obviously rechargeable, and with two USB Ports it’s easy to keep several gadgets charged when out on the trail. It’s a compact size and best of all, it should be available already this October.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-go">Where to go?</h2>

<p>I have a short list of must-visit places &amp; companies I want to check out at the fair - from the Trend Lounge and Black Diamond over Petzl to Adidas Outdoor, as well as the usual suspects Arc’teryx, RAB and Scarpa, plus a few more. But is there a company you - <em>yes, you reading this!</em> - would like me to visit? With <a href="http://www.outdoor-show.com/od-en/index-of-exhibitors/index.php?navid=538007229630">960 exhibitors from 40 nations</a> the list is long, so if you’re curious about a specific company why not let me know in the comments which company you think I should check out and I will swing by them at the fair to check them out &amp; report on their kit!</p>

<h2 id="bloggers-are-welcome-at-the-outdoor">Bloggers are welcome at the OutDoor!</h2>

<p>The best thing for me at the OutDoor has always been meeting the people: The contacts you exchange emails with at the companies and PR Agencies, <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/08/ueli-steck-interview.html">meeting athletes</a> and of course my fellow bloggers and Social Media mates. So I’m pretty excited about the <a href="http://www.outdoor-show.com/od-en/the-outdoor/outdoor-blogger-base.php?navid=545263545263">OBN Blogger Base</a>, which allows me to work &amp; meet fellow bloggers from across the globe. Best of all: OBN organizes every day an OBN_talk where you can learn about topics which are important to us, and the Blogger Walk across the fair promises to be a good way to meet new companies, too. </p>

<p>If you’re an outdoor blogger you totally want to <a href="http://www.outdoor-show.com/od-en/press/Blogger.php">get accredited as a blogger</a> for the fair, as it has a lot of benefits - from access to the Blogger Base to the Blogger Breakfast. And best of all: It’s free for us outdoor bloggers! Apply now for your <a href="http://www.outdoor-show.com/od-en/press/Blogger.php">Blogger Pass</a>, and then comment and lets meet up at the OutDoor! </p>

<p>And already now and during the fair you can follow the Hashtag #OutDoorFN on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/outdoorfn/">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OutDoorFN">Twitter</a> for real-time updates on the fair. I’m sure it will be super busy once the 13th of July comes around!</p>
