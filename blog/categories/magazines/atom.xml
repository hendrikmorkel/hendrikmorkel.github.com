<h2 id="mountain-pro">Mountain Pro</h2>

<p>For the digital Mountain Pro Magazine I interview the BMG Mountain Guide <a href="http://www.mountainpromag.com/imag/mountainprojuly2015/files/34.html">Tim Blakemore</a> whom I met last year at the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/07/arcteryx-alpine-academy-2014.html">Arc’teryx Alpine Academy</a>. It’s a nice story that looks at the work of a Mountain Guide and fits well in with the Alpine topic of the issue, where also Jon Griffith, <a href="http://www.alexroddie.com/index.html">Alex Roddie</a> and many others have contributed fascinating stories. <a href="http://www.mountainpromag.com/imag/mountainprojuly2015/">Available for free online</a>.</p>

<h2 id="adventure-travel">Adventure Travel</h2>

<p>In the <a href="http://adventuretravelmagazine.co.uk/">Adventure Travel Magazine</a> I wrote about my Polish Tatras trip last year, and the change from busy streets to lonely summits. It looks great and has all the details to plan your own trip to the Tatras, which I too hope to visit again very soon. <a href="http://adventuretravelmagazine.co.uk/index.php/magazine">Buy the magazine online</a> or at your local news agent.</p>

<h2 id="klettern">klettern</h2>

<p>My first story for the German <a href="http://www.klettern.de/">klettern</a> is about our Åland trip last autumn and features the stunning photos of my mate <a href="http://vertical-axis.de/">Nico Altmaier</a>. It’s a great looking Mini Guide to an area which surely will see a lot more visitors soon! <a href="http://www.klettern.de/heft.243.5.htm">Order it online</a> or pick it up at your news agent. </p>

<h2 id="trekking-magazin">trekking Magazin</h2>

<p>For the trekking Magazin I reviewed my favourite summer shirts and wrote a reportage about packrafting and how it opens up new possibilities for backpackers and trekkers. It’s a fine looking article with lots of infos on four different packrafts I have tested and a variety of packrafting gear. You can pick it up at your local news agent or <a href="http://shop.trekkingmagazin.com/de/trekking-magazin/einzelhefte">order it here</a>.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19259974084/in/dateposted/" title="trekking Magazin 04/2015"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3690/19259974084_9c2e3efe4a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="trekking Magazin 04/2015" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="kiipeily">Kiipeily</h2>

<p>I joined the Finnish Climbing Association as a Gear Editor at the beginning of the year and will have a regular gear review column in the magazine. In this issue I reviewed the <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/petzl-hirundos-klettergurt/">Petzl Hirundos</a> harness and the <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/mammut-smart-sicherungsgeraet/">Mammut Smart</a>, both items which I rated very high. To get the magazine <a href="http://climbing.fi/skil/">join the Finnish Climbing Association</a>.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19694627830/in/dateposted/" title="Kiipeily 2/ 2015"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/462/19694627830_30e89578c0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Kiipeily 2/ 2015" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="bike--travel">Bike &amp; Travel</h2>

<p>And finally I wrote for the newest German cycling Magazine <a href="http://www.biketravel-magazin.com/">Bike &amp; Travel</a> about Bikepacking and exploring non-paved roads with your bike and about staying hydrated on your bike. You can grab a copy at the news agent or <a href="http://shop.trekkingmagazin.com/de/biketravel/biketravel-magazin-1-2015">order it online</a>.</p>

<p>The new issue has a very lengthy special on Via Ferratas by me, as well as hiking in dangerous terrain. The latter gives tips on what to do when there’s no blue bird weather but you’re confronted by hail, snow and strong winds, how to cross rivers and what to consoder when you’re in the mountains and on glaciers. In my gear column I talk about approach shoes and review five pairs of approach shoes from <a href="http://bit.ly/1zDfoq6">adidas</a>, <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/05/arcteryx-acrux2-fl-gtx.html">Arc’teryx</a>, <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/lowa-laurin-gtx-lo-approachschuhe/">Lowa</a>, <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/five-ten-guide-tennie-schuhe-ca-sun-ca-sun-uk4/">Five Ten</a> and <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/salomon-x-alp-gtx-approachschuhe/">Salomon</a>. There’s also great tips on outdoor photography and plenty of great trip reports in Germany, Austria, Italy and Romania.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://biketravel-magazin.com/">Bike &amp; Travel Magazine</a> hit the shelves last week, but together with the publisher I have been working since spring 2014 on this new magazine. It was one of the reasons for me to get a couple of new <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/11/pelago-bicycles-stavanger.html">bikes</a> and it has been an interesting ride to see a new magazine being born. I will contribute to the magazine for at least the next two years, so if you like my writing you might want to <a href="https://ssl.topackt.com/trekkingmagazin.com/bikeabo/abo_eingabe.php?AboArt=ZweiJahresabo">take out a subscription</a> and don’t miss any issue. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17036201878" title="Bike &amp; Travel Magazine 01/2015 by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7705/17036201878_11a7108d95_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Bike &amp; Travel Magazine 01/2015" /></a></p>

<p>For this issue I contributed an article on comfortable sleeping along the trail/ road and lament that many people seem to be using massive tents and camping gear - the reasoning seems to be that many traditional bike-tourers think along the lines of <em>“I don’t need to carry it and have plenty of space”</em> - I showcase gear from the opposite side of the spectrum (so it’s light, compact and just as comfortable). Future articles will continue along these lines and also include a few nice bike tours in Europe. </p>

<p>The main focus of the magazine is on the adventures and tours you can do with your bike. The magazine has eight trip reports in the inaugural issue and is set to continue along these lines - there’s enough cycling gear magazines on the market already, and as <a href="http://www.fastcoexist.com/3043858/world-changing-ideas/the-science-of-why-you-should-spend-your-money-on-experiences-not-thing">research shows</a> - experiences are more valuable than the stuff you own. In that sense, grab the first issue of <a href="http://biketravel-magazin.com/">Bike &amp; Travel</a>, swing a leg over your bike and go for a ride!</p>

<p>I had a lot of fun writing for the second trekking Magazin issue of 2015. It included getting a lot of outdoor garments dirty and then learning about how to make them clean and functional again with the help of a bunch of outdoor detergents. Then I had fun taking photos for my hoody round-up and reviewing six hoodies, which should allow anyone who doesn’t have a hoody yet to find one for his needs! And finally I penned a story about my <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/tatra-mountains/">Polish Tatra</a> trip which you already could read about on these digital pages in the past. As usually that’s not all: My colleagues went out sleeping in <em>Biwakschachteln</em> (bivouac booths) in the Alps, while others went went exploring the Swiss Engadin and hike to an volcano that was erupting. A lot of really inspiring trip reports which certainly will get out in the mood for spring hikes!</p>

<p>My <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2010/10/from-russia-with-love.html">From Russia With Love</a> trip report is still super popular and in the first trekking Magazin issue of 2015 I wrote a trip report auf Deutsch. It’s a great looking article and gives tips to plan your own hike in Karelia, so well worth to pick it up just for that. In my gear column I talk about down jackets and review the <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/hagloefs-essens-ii-down-weste-noble-blue-s/?pid=81">Häglöfs Essens II Down Vest</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/14pEniz">Arc’teryx Cerium SL Jacket</a>, <a href="http://www.phdesigns.co.uk/yukon-down-jacket">PHD Yukon Down Jacket</a> and the <a href="http://bit.ly/1hh35k8">Mountain Equipment Vega Jacket</a>. </p>
