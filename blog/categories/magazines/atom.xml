<p>In the last issue of 2014 you will find in my Gear column a discussion of Hardshell Jackets for hiking. After discussing what a hardshell is made of and what it should have I review five different jackets which I have used this year. Elsewhere there is a company interview with ORTOVOX, tips on buying snowshoes and a visit to the island Elba in Tuscany.</p>

<p>In this issue I write about the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/07/arcteryx-alpine-academy-2014.html">Arc’teryx Alpine Academy</a> which I visited in June and give a lot of details about planning your own stay in Chamonix. In my columne I write about five great hiking pants from Houdini to Klättermusen, and then there’s a very long trip report in it about my hike on the Escapardenne Eisleck Trail in Luxembourg which I thru-hiked in May of this year. It’s a beautiful trail with lots to offer and is well suited for those that look for culture, nature and a well-marked trail.</p>

<p>And of course there’s still plenty more in there, from fine hikes in Germany to rambling through the hills of Tuscany. Thus go pick up the current issue at a Kiosk near you or take out a <a href="http://www.trekkingmagazin.com/abonnement">subscription</a> to not miss any future issue.</p>

<p>Issue four has two articles by your truly: My <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/lake-district/">Lakeland Trip Report</a> auf Deutsch and in my column I talk about lightweight footwear. Also my colleagues have been busy and write about fine trips from the Black Forest in Germany, the Azores Island Pico, the Dolomites and Austria. Also some <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/outdoor-fair-2014/">OutDoor 2014</a> is in the mag though I think you’re better off with my articles ;) </p>

<p>Very happy I am that they printed my barefoot and trailrunning columne without changes - in it I write black on white what the majority of you already know: That hiking boots are not the best footwear for hiking and that with a lighter, more minimalist shoe you can have a healthier stride and more enjoyment in the outdoors. I hope there will be many boot wearers who will try out some of the suggested shoes or similar ones!</p>

<p>As always there is plenty more in this issue which will keep you entertained for many hours and inspire you to go outdoors.

<p>This issue features a summer layering guide in my gear column, while colleagues of mine take a look at trekking sandals and how to keep insects at bay in the outdoors. As for trip reports and inspiration, this issue has a massive twenty pages of hiking and backpacking in Italy. The beautiful Trentino is featured, as is the Aosta Valley, the Matterhorn and an island in the Mediterranean sea. If you have kids you will like the story of hiking with kids around the Tegernsee, and if you call sailing a hobby of yours, too, then the story about hiking and sailing will show you how to combine the two hobbies for one fine trip. </p>

<p>And there is plenty more in this issue which will keep you entertained for many hours and inspire you to go backpacking. You can pick the current issue up at a Kiosk, take out a <a href="http://www.trekkingmagazin.com/abonnement">subscription</a> or order a <a href="http://www.trekkingmagazin.com/magazin/probeexemplar">free review copy</a>.</p>

<p>It’s spring everywhere, with temperatures of 22°C in Germany and even in Vaasa the thermometer stays positive and the sun is out. Birds are singing, the sun is shining - yes, it’s spring. And that’s also the topic of the newest issue of the trekking Magazin. On 100 pages the spring hiking &amp; trekking season is celebrated, and trip reports from Oman, Denmark, the Zillertal and Spain get you into spring mood. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/13058115303/" title="trekking Magazin 02/2014 by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7351/13058115303_d898c1f160_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="trekking Magazin 02/2014" /></a></p>

<p>In my gear column I shed light on the mysteries of softshells &amp; when they make sense, and do quick reviews of the <a href="http://bit.ly/1fiPblo">Outdoor Research Enchainment Jacket</a>, <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/mountain-equipment-trojan-hooded-jacke-nautilus/">Mountain Equipment Trojan</a>, <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/ortovox-andermatt-vest-blue-ocean/">Ortovox Andermatt Vest</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/OcTdRJ">Black Diamond Alpine Start Hoody</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/1gHaaxw">Montane Sabretooth jacket</a>. A look at durable outdoor phones and hiking socks, an interview with Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner, and gear for kids recommendations round out this issue. </p>
