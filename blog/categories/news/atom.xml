<p><em>These posts do take a lot of time to write so I am happy if you’d <a href="http://bit.ly/1HGCWMS">get me a coffee</a> as a payment for my work =)</em></p>

<h2 id="marmot">Marmot</h2>

<p><a href="http://marmot.de">Marmot</a> had a wide range of new kit on the show so lets dive straight in. The Red Star Jacket for Men/ Starfire Jacket for Women is the first 3-layer jacket to incorporate the exceptionally breathable, very robust and waterproof NanoPro™ membrane. It’s very stretchy, 100% seam taped, has a fully adjustable hood with a laminated brim to keep your sight dry, and will weigh 425 g. The Red Star Pants has 3/4 Length Water-Resistant Side Zippers and will tip the scales at 470 g and should make for a breathable &amp; waterproof combo which keeps you dry in heavy rain.</p>

<p>The Graviton 38 backpack weighs 1.080 g and comes with a ventilated suspension (carrying) system. The series - there’s four different sizes in total - features a single-piece aluminum uniframe which should have good load stability and features soft pads in the shoulder and waist areas for improved carry comfort. Compression
straps on the sides and base, trekking pole attachment and several easily accessible pockets round out this pack. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" data-header="false" data-footer="false" data-context="false" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/20491534738/in/dateposted/" title="Marmot Graviton 38 backpack"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/638/20491534738_b95bf1624d_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Marmot Graviton 38 backpack" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Helium Sleeping Bag tips the scales at 935 g in Regular length and is filled with 560 g of hydrophobic, RDS certified down, which should keep you toasty till around -9°C Comfort. Really cool was the “Fold-Down” second zipper on the right which provides more ventilation and easy access. The Full Length Locking YKK Two Way Zipper has a Zip-Guard Slider which prevents the lining from getting stuck in the zipper, which solves a common problem in (sleeping bag) zippers. Overall a nice looking sleeping bag.</p>

<p>The Vapor FC 2P is a 2.520 g 2 Person tent with a size of 107 x 137 x 224 cm and a spacey vestibule. The doors got bigger for easy access, a lamp shade pocket in the roof lets you read at night without a headlamp on and the color-coded pole clip system makes it easy to pitch. It looked like a nice 3-season tent for couples, but there’s also 3 and 4 Person tents available of the Vapor for families and small groups.</p>

<p>In the climbing garments corner there were lots of clothes for your favourite pastime. Cool designs in combination with functional &amp; stretchy materials make for sweet shirts, pants and hoodies to hit the crag in. Add in a new climbing pack called the <em>Gear Hauler</em> and you have all you need for a fun day climbing. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" data-header="false" data-footer="false" data-context="false" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/20491536718/in/dateposted/" title="Marmot"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/730/20491536718_690fde99ec_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Marmot" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="scarpa">Scarpa</h2>

<p>Wow, I really was surprised by all the new shoes from <a href="http://scarpa.it">Scarpa</a>! Lots of trailrunning/ ultralight backpacking shoes from them, and I found they actually looked good! The Proton is a shoe made for heel strikers which gives you good support on long runs. Will weigh around 360 g per shoe and has a Vibram® Genesis sole and lots of cushioning in the heel.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" data-header="false" data-footer="false" data-context="false" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/20491564180/in/dateposted/" title="Scarpa Proton"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5726/20491564180_8969bb3378_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Scarpa Proton" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Atom certainly was the most interesting shoe in the line, and at 260 g per shoe it was also rather light. Colour &amp; sole-wise it gets big thumbs up from me, the Vibram®  Genetic Lite reminds me of a trailrunning shoe I have used a lot. Scarpa says it <em>“Created for athletes with a perfect running style who weigh less than 70 kg, they will find this shoe is very reactive and it suits the athlete who favors a running style based on the toes”</em>. Well, if that doesn’t sound like a great shoe for me, I don’t know! Add in a breathable mesh upper and you will have a shoe which could become very popular.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" data-header="false" data-footer="false" data-context="false" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/20653292466/in/dateposted/" title="Scarpa Atom"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5634/20653292466_a275b465eb_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Scarpa Atom" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Neutron weighs 295 g and has a Vibram® Genetic sole that should give good grip on any kind of wet or dry terrain. It’s available as a fabric version, a special Women’s version and for Winter runs even as a Gore-Tex lined shoe. Still light enough for UL backpackers, but with more support and cushioning. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" data-header="false" data-footer="false" data-context="false" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/20057014404/in/dateposted/" title="Scarpa Neutron"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5740/20057014404_560df31ac3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Scarpa Neutron" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Scarpa Mountaineering boots aka the Phantom Line is awesome. It’s designed by Ueli Steck which means this are the boots that Ueli designed and uses himself - be it climbing Annapurna or on his 82 Summits project. There’s three new boots and they all feature the new zipper which runs around the shoe. It looks cool but I am a bit wondering how practical it will be in use when you need to pull a zipper behind your leg, and of course such a long zipper also adds weight and complexity aka a place where it can fail. Scarpa writes that the <em>“innovative “orange peel-like” closure with Flexseal® Waterproof zip avoids any inconvenience to the ankle movements”</em> so I guess it will have a benefit. Anyway. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" data-header="false" data-footer="false" data-context="false" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/20058614443/in/photostream/" title="Scarpa Phantom Mountaineering Boots"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/611/20058614443_2482540e7f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Scarpa Phantom Mountaineering Boots" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>There’s three new boots - the Phantom 8000, the Phantom 6000 and the Phantom Tech. All have a gaiter made from KCN-Tech Fabric, S-Tech Fabric and an Outdry® membrane , which I like as I find OutDry better working as Gore-Tex. All three boots also have a Carbon insole and a Vibram® Gravity sole. The Phantom Tech is the lightest boot at 830 g per boot and also the least warm, but as it has a Primaloft® insulation layer I have no doubt that it will be a great alpine climbing/ ice climbing boot (in the photo underneath is the Tech on the right and the 6000 on the left).</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" data-header="false" data-footer="false" data-context="false" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/20679570315/in/dateposted/" title="Scarpa Mountaineering Boots"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5827/20679570315_29ac835ee9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Scarpa Mountaineering Boots" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Phantom 6000 and 8000 come with a removable liner boot that has a Primaloft® lining and a 4 mm thermo-insulating EVA sole. The 6000 is made for peaks up to 6000 m and weighs 995 g per boot while the Phantom 8000 is made for the highest summits of the globe and weighs 1310 g per boot. The hole line looked sweet, curious to try out the Phantom 6000 in the Karakoram in the future!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" data-header="false" data-footer="false" data-context="false" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/20670328742/in/photostream/" title="Scarpa Phantom Mountaineering Boots"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5687/20670328742_fe268302e1_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Scarpa Phantom Mountaineering Boots" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And then there’s Drago, the new climbing shoe. Made for bouldering, hard sports climbing indoors and outdoors the Drago is close in design to the Furia but has a Velcro strap for a good fit. The rubber on the upper goes really high for sticky toe hooks. The shoe is soft and gives you good control on small ledges and difficult placements.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" data-header="false" data-footer="false" data-context="false" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/20057007954/in/dateposted/" title="Scarpa Drago Climbing Shoe"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/676/20057007954_6eb66f1fcb_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Scarpa Drago Climbing Shoe" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="haglfs">Haglöfs</h2>

<p>Haglöfs is a big company with many lines so it’s always a bit difficult to grasp all the new gear, especially as there’s so much new interesting kit. The Roc Helios 25 backpack is an OutDoor Award winner that’s made from XPac and has a back opening to access your gear. It’s made for mountaineering so has all the details you want from a rucksack for the mountains, but should do well when abused for backpacking, too. No info on weight, sorry.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" data-header="false" data-footer="false" data-context="false" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/20461137721/in/dateposted/" title="Haglöfs Roc Helios 25 backpack"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3814/20461137721_acafbdf705_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Haglöfs Roc Helios 25 backpack" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Herakles Jacket is 455 g in Size L and made from a 3-layer Gore-tex with the new CKnit backer. It’s a mountain jacket with a helmet-compatible hood, an articulated design for freedom of movement and high pockets. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" data-header="false" data-footer="false" data-context="false" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/20268246879/in/dateposted/" title="Haglöfs Herakles Jacket"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/415/20268246879_e39a6fb420_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Haglöfs Herakles Jacket" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Gram Pulse trailrunners - the Women’s model is in the photo - will weigh 215 g for a Women’s shoe and 260 g for a Men’s shoe. The sole pattern looks familiar and thus should be good, and on top there’s non-absorbing fabrics which should maintain a low weight in wet conditions. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" data-header="false" data-footer="false" data-context="false" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/20461140421/in/dateposted/" title="Haglöfs Gram Pulse Shoe"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/458/20461140421_b578c49369_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Haglöfs Gram Pulse Shoe" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And then there’s another backpack, the LIM Strive Backpack. Can’t give the weight on this pack either, but it felt light for being a 50 l pack. The front zipper makes for easy access to gear, the lid can be removed for more weight saving. The hipbelt pockets were pretty big, made from a stretchy mesh and looked great, and the material is bluesign certified 100HT Robic™, which also some cottages use for making their packs. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" data-header="false" data-footer="false" data-context="false" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/20454898805/in/dateposted/" title="LIM Strive Backpack"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/439/20454898805_f9e2a1f04c_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="LIM Strive Backpack" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="vaude">Vaude</h2>

<p>I’m pretty psyched about the biggest news for backpackers from <a href="http://www.vaude.com">Vaude</a>, and that’s the Alpstein 450 DWN quilt. Why? Well, I’m pretty proud that <a href="http://blog.fastpacking.de">Carsten</a> and me helped during the development of this quilt. We both have tested early prototypes and gave the designer a lot of feedback on what we liked and what could be better. I think I’ll give some insights on this quilt further down the road in a separate post, but the cool things are: 450 g of RDS certified down in the Alpstein 450 DWN (200 g in the Alpstein 200 DWN), total weight 750 g (550 g), and a unique attachment system which allows you to attach the quilt pretty easily to any sleeping pad. Oh, and it’s pretty cool that the quilt won a OutDoor Gold OutDoor Award, too! </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" data-header="false" data-footer="false" data-context="false" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/20516026200/in/dateposted/" title="Vaude Alpstein 450 DWN quilt"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/723/20516026200_795ffbd627_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Vaude Alpstein 450 DWN quilt" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Then there’s the Citus 24 LW Backpack, a 500 g 24 l Volume pack that’s made from a siliconizied 40 D Rip-Stop. Special is that is has a Aeroflex back panel which should keep you dries aka less sweaty on your summer hikes. It has a zippered lid pocket, mesh side stretch pockets and a compression system that also lets you carry wet gear on the front. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" data-header="false" data-footer="false" data-context="false" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/20516112978/in/dateposted/" title="Vaude Citus 24 LW Backpack"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5643/20516112978_a85234b05f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Vaude Citus 24 LW Backpack" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Pro Windshell Jacket weighs less than 80 g and is a cycling windjacket which packs tiny when not needed. Reflective details, long back, stretch inserts on the sides for freedom of movement and breathability and a PFC-free Eco Finish water repellency treatment that makes it water-resistant, its a wind jacket you can wear cycling or when out on the hills.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" data-header="false" data-footer="false" data-context="false" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/20710926061/in/dateposted/" title="Pro Windshell LW"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5652/20710926061_7afc5fae6a_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Pro Windshell LW" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And as we’re already talking cycling the Moab Low &amp; Mid Flatpedal shoes are environmentally friendly made flat pedal cycling shoes. The Moab Low AM and Moab Mid STX AM fulfil the strict Vaude <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQgt80pO0YM">Green Shape</a> criteria and still will perform great on the trail. A great move to get a difficult product likes shoes fulfil this standard, and I hope we’ll see more of this in the future, also from other manufacturers.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" data-header="false" data-footer="false" data-context="false" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/20694848822/in/dateposted/" title="Vaude Moab Low &amp; Mid Flatpedal shoes"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/762/20694848822_079c2a46ee_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Vaude Moab Low &amp; Mid Flatpedal shoes" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="norrna">Norrøna</h2>

<p>The news from <a href="https://www.norrona.com">Norrøna</a> included the bitihorn alpha60 Jacket which is a 250 g insulation piece that’s filled with Polartec Alpha. The shell is wind and water resistant so it also can be worn on its own, but it should be a good midlayer, too. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" data-header="false" data-footer="false" data-context="false" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/20261529486/in/dateposted/" title="Norrøna bitihorn alpha60 Jacket"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/395/20261529486_55568dd61a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Norrøna bitihorn alpha60 Jacket" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Now available is the fjørå line for Women (Men’s have been available for a while already). These are really great for riding on single track trails or shredding down hills, made from good materials and give good wind protection but also keep you cool on the uphill.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" data-header="false" data-footer="false" data-context="false" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/20101181829/in/dateposted/" title="Norrøna fjøra line"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/456/20101181829_5747a8e82c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Norrøna fjøra line" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Lifestyle lines were a big trend at the OutDoor, and it’s understandable. Norrøna’s 29 line is very stylish and a mix of technical and functional fabrics. There’s a cool limited edition Denim Anorak which will make you stand out at the camp fire or in the office. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" data-header="false" data-footer="false" data-context="false" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/20261544666/in/photostream/" title="Norrøna Lifestyle 29 Line"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3678/20261544666_2f1e05181a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Norrøna Lifestyle 29 Line" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="montane">Montane</h2>

<p>I only had a brief visit at <a href="Montane">Montane</a> so can’t give all the details on the lightweight new kit from them - which is a shame, as they had a very cool looking cuben fibre pack on display! But what I saw and tried were the new Ultra Tour packs, which did remind me design-wise from a now bankrupt lightweight company from the USA. Which isn’t bad, as that pack has been super popular. The Ultra Tour is available as a 22, 40 and 55 l volume pack, which will weigh 540 g, 725 g and 840 g respectively. There’s a roll-top closure, large stretch side pockets, a Comfort Vent Back Pad and Contact Air Mesh shoulder straps which will keep you cooler on long hikes with heavy loads, hip pockets and a front pocket/ compartment. These looked very good and if priced right (= affordable) these could become great entry-level UL packs.</p>

<p>The Minimus 777 Pull-On is a 134 g hardshell that packs tiny and should be very breathable. The construction is of a very high quality that’s made to last, and in orange it also looks really sweet. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" data-header="false" data-footer="false" data-context="false" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/20670323222/in/dateposted/" title="Montane Minimus 777 Pull-On"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5693/20670323222_a126f9bded_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Montane Minimus 777 Pull-On" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>As I said, a shame I didn’t snap photos of the other new kit, as with the <em>ultra alpine 38 + 5</em> (a 547 g alpine climbing pack with a sweet design), the <em>hyper tour 38</em> (a 639 g cuben fibre hiking pack that can be stripped to 478 g) and several great garments there would have been plenty of interesting kit for lightweight backpackers, Alpinists and trailrunners!</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.nikwax.com/en-gb/">Nikwax</a> Down Wash Direct is an aftercare product which lets you clean and improve the performance of regular and hydrophobic garments/ quilts/ sleeping bags alike. What’s really cool is not just that Down Wash Direct is environmentally friendly but that it makes your down kit hydrophobic, even if it hasn’t been hydrophobic down to begin with. That’s a great way to make your favourite down jacket hydrophobic - both the down and the DWR of the shell. An exciting product that I’m curious to test with some of my down kit and see how it improves performance.</p>

<h2 id="omm">OMM</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.theomm.com">OMM</a> makes sweet kit that makes ultralight backpackers and fell runners alike happy. The Phantom 25CL was the highlight, a great pack that would be ideal for a fast &amp; light weekend in the hills or an OMM event. It has a integrated sleeping mat and a carbon suspension system. The back length can be adjusted via an easy system, the stretchy side pockets were super easy to reach and the compression system could be adjusted with the pack on. Tipping the scales at just 400 g the Phantom 25CL is a great pack that works a charm if you go fast.</p>

<p>The Ultra 8 is a new pack that will be super affordable and great for training or a SUL overnighter. Mesh side pockets, a good carrying system and a 8 l main compartment let you carry all you need for a day out running in the hills.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" data-header="false" data-footer="false" data-context="false" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/20057013414/in/dateposted/" title="OMM Ultra 8"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/757/20057013414_c51cbdd786_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="OMM Ultra 8" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>If you need some more space on your existing pack, take a look at the Compressor Pod. It can work as a UL pack on its own, but it’s designed to be attached to a OMM pack or another pack and gives you more protected carrying space. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" data-header="false" data-footer="false" data-context="false" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/20653312566/in/dateposted/" title="OMM Compressor Pod"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/629/20653312566_f41a8c4c0f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="OMM Compressor Pod" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Finally, the Grid Longsleeve is simply a functional &amp; good-looking longsleeve for runners &amp; outdoor enthusiasts alike. The cool contour lines on the sleeves are a nice detail.</p>

<h2 id="jetboil">Jetboil</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.jetboil.com">Jetboil</a> had two interesting news on the show: A Basecamp stove and the MicroMo - the successor to the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2011/09/jetboil-sol-ti.html">Sol Ti</a>. Lets take a look at the MicroMo first. It weighs 340 g all in and the pot has a volume of 0,8 l. You can store a 100 g cartridge inside the pot with the burner unit and on the outside a cozy lets you handle the pot with its hot content. Burning time for half a litre is supposed to be 2:15 min and it should be less ideal for cooking/ simmering than the MiniMo. The pot et al. is now made from Aluminium, so there should hopefully not be any melting fluxrings anymore.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" data-header="false" data-footer="false" data-context="false" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/20653299766/in/dateposted/" title="Jetboil Micro Mo"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5787/20653299766_ffd9bf075d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Jetboil Micro Mo" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Genesis on the other hand is found at the opposite side of the spectrum of the MicroMo and weighs 4.100 g. I don’t know how light that is for a basecamp stove, but it sounds pretty good. A 5 l pot lets you cook for the team and the pan is ideal for bacon and eggs in the morning. The 2-Burner stove fits inside of the pot with the pan on top. I can see this coming in handy for car camping, glamping and canoe trips, too.</p>

<h2 id="outdoor-research">Outdoor Research</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.outdoorresearch.com">Outdoor Research</a>’s big news was that they now have a new investor on board, which allows them to invest more into R&amp;D and tap into the knowledge of the new partner. The first result is the <strong>Precipice Jacket™</strong> which uses the new AscentShell™ fabric technology, a 308 g (Size L) hardshell that’s made of 100% nylon 20D mechanical stretch ripstop face with a 100% Polyester 12D backer. The jacket is fully seam-taped and has a laminated construction with Dynamic Reach™ Underarm Panels which allow great freedom of movement. A helmet compatible Wire-Brimmed Halo-Hood™ keeps the head dry and one of the internal pockets doubles as a stuff sack. An interesting jacket with a new technology, curious to see if it performs better than existing hardshell fabrics.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/20279450652/in/album-72157656356655229/" title="Outdoor Research"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/376/20279450652_26a25f52f2_b.jpg" width="694" height="1024" alt="Outdoor Research" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Next up was the <strong>Ferrosi Summit Hooded Jacket™</strong> which adds a more durable, rugged jacket to the Ferrosi family that is still highly breathable while offering protection  for full mountain conditions. It is 526 g in Size 34 and has all the bells &amp; whistles you need from a mountain jacket: A helmet-compatible Wire-Brimmed Halo-Hood™, zippered chest &amp; hand pockets, Dynamic Reach™ Underarm Panels and being of course water-, wind-, and abrasion-resistant. Also new to the Ferrosi family is the <strong>Ferrosi Crag Pants™</strong> which will tip the scales at 314 g in Size 34 and comes with articulated knees, a gusseted crotch and a low-profile waist with Knit Stretch Panels for freedom of movement in the mountains.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19665150104/in/album-72157656356655229/" title="Outdoor Research"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/393/19665150104_302f925916_b.jpg" width="597" height="1024" alt="Outdoor Research" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I really loved the look of the <strong>Women’s Ferrosi Knickers™</strong> which had a great orange (that was slightly difficult to photograph). It’s a rock climbing pants that has stretch knit panels at the waist which allows you to easily wear a harness over it. The lightweight stretch-woven construction is highly durable, for fun days at the crag.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19666841233/in/album-72157656356655229/" title="Outdoor Research Women’s  Ferrosi  Knickers™"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/487/19666841233_2bcc39743d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Outdoor Research Women’s  Ferrosi  Knickers™" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Already available are the <strong>Splitter Gloves™</strong>, OR’s take on crack gloves. These were very comfortable thanks to the synthetic suede on the inside and a non-slip  synthetic leather on the outside gives you grip in cracks and protects your hands. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/20099785740/in/album-72157656356655229/" title="Outdoor Research Splitter Gloves™"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3797/20099785740_b33bc64944_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Outdoor Research Splitter Gloves™" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Completely new is also the <strong>Sensor Dry Series</strong> which come in Premium &amp; Standard versions. Both are waterproof according to the IPX-8 Standard, fully touchscreen (and camera!) functional, have welded seams and are fairly lightweight. The Premium versions come with waterproof pins for your headphones and can swim when dropped into the water. Available for normal sized smartphone, massive smartphones and tablets.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/20101180819/in/album-72157656356655229/" title="Outdoor Research"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3709/20101180819_8489a1fa22_b.jpg" width="735" height="1024" alt="Outdoor Research" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And finally there were plenty of new hats, like the <strong>Helium Rain Bucket™</strong>, a waterproof hat; the <strong>Mesa Verde Sun Hat™</strong>, a 78 g light sun hat for the ladies; and the <strong>Springboard Cap</strong> I am sporting there, a lightweight cap for your trail adventures.</p>

<h2 id="cilogear">CiloGear</h2>

<p><em>“Have you seen anything new &amp; interesting yet?”</em> is the standard conversation opener at the fair. In years past my reply was usually <em>“Nope”</em> but this year I passed Graham from <a href="http://www.cilogear.com">CiloGear</a> as I had some time to spare and walked with him to his booth where he showed me something. What I saw then was not new, but it was for me the coolest thing on the fair which I told everyone who asked me the opening question then. Graham had a pack along - the first preproduction <a href="http://www.cilogear.com/30wwo.html">3030</a> ever made - which had seen roughly 900 (!) days outdoors, including two expeditions to Pakistan and was along establishing a new route on K7, a 6,934 m peak near the Charakusa Valley in the Karakoram. The owner sent it in to get the extension collar renewed, but the rest of the pack - seams and material - were still in great shape (albeit a tad dirty, but what do you expect after over two years in the mountains!). For me the most interesting thing in the show, not just because it shows that small manufacturers produce superb gear that lasts, but also because of the stories this pack would tell. </p>

<h2 id="arcteryx">Arc’teryx</h2>

<p>The big news at <a href="http://arcteryx.com">Arc’teryx</a> was their <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/06/arcteryx-acrux-ar-alpine-boot.html">2016 Footwear</a> which I already have presented to you in June. The next big news was the <strong>Atom SL Hoody</strong>, an ultralight summer insulation piece that will weigh 285 g for a Men’s Medium. The Coreloft 40g/m² insulation is quilted to the liner while on the side and arm panels a soft fleece material helps with ventilation. Really interesting is the No-Slip-Zip™ front zipper which works like a series of speed bumps that keep the zipper from self-opening. It packs tiny and so can always be along in your backpack on your mountain adventures.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/20099806578/in/album-72157656356655229/" title="Arc&#x27;teryx Atom SL Hoody"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/520/20099806578_9a436d4504_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Arc&#x27;teryx Atom SL Hoody" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>That backpack could be one of the new <strong>Cierzo Packs</strong>, Arc’teryx’s updated alpine climbing pack (in the centre of the photo underneath). Available as a Cierzo 18 (375 g) and a Cierzo 28 (550 g) they open via a pull to open, pull to close drawcord system like the Alpha FL packs, but also feature a SwiftCord™ drawstring compression system which is versatile in use and can be stored away when not needed. You can carry ice tools with them, and the Cierzo 28 has a padded back panel that can be removed to save more weight. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19665147454/in/album-72157656356655229/" title="Arc&#x27;teryx 2016 Backpacks"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3796/19665147454_f7b2ba9550_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Arc&#x27;teryx 2016 Backpacks" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Interesting for hiking &amp; backpacking was also the <strong>Pelon Comp SS</strong> which is made from core-spun Merino wool and has durable nylon inserts in high wear areas as the shoulders. They weigh 145 g in Size M and have a Regular fit and should be pretty good for long trips in the outdoors thanks to the properties of Merino wool.</p>

<h2 id="petzl">Petzl</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.petzl.com/">Petzl</a> had a lot of new gear on their booth, and they were also celebrating 25 years of the GriGri, probably the most popular belay device amongst all sorts of climbers.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/20287806355/in/album-72157656356655229/" title="Petzl 25 years GriGri"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/520/20287806355_da5ee93c48_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Petzl 25 years GriGri" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>But the new gear! All of the IRVIS, VASAK, SARKEN, LYNX, DARTWIN and DART crampons get technical upgrades, making them even more effective, durable and practical. Effective: the horizontal structure of the frame brings the boot sole as close to the crampon as possible for increased sensitivity and precision. Durable: a special steel, chosen by Petzl for its rigidity and strength, allows a reduction in thickness to offer light weight crampons with sharper points. Practical: user-friendly binding systems, ANTISNOW and interchangeable front sections.</p>

<p>The <strong>IRVIS, VASAK and SARKEN Crampons</strong> have front sections that are interchangeable and available as accessories, which means you can have one crampon for all your needs and don’t need two or more of crampons in the house. Now you can simply &amp; fast convert for example a technical mountaineering crampon into one for glacier travel. All of them come with the new ANTISNOW, which limits snow balling up under your crampon. The VASAK will weigh 810 g, the IRVIS 710 g and the SARKEN 810 g, all with the FLEXLOCK binding. The linking bar in all three can be shortened to fit small sizes (Size 36 is the smallest size all three will fit, with Size 50 being the max).</p>

<p>The <strong>ELIA</strong> is a new Women’s helmet with the OMEGA headband system. The notch in the back is for the long hair and allows ladies to put the helmet on and off very easily with a lot of comfort. It is 285 g light and also has a new webbing adjustment mechanism which allows the helmet to be precisely adjusted for different head shapes. The ABS shell and expanded polystyrene liner will keep the wearer save.</p>

<p>The <strong>TIBLOC</strong> has been around for a while and gets a update for 2016. The new ultralight emergency ascender gets a system that automatically presses the carabiner against the rope to initiate the clamping action on the rope. You can see this advantage in comparison to the current TIBLOC in the 2nd photo underneath. The new TIBLOC has a rope compatibility from 8 to 11 mm and weighs 35 g.</p>

<p>Furthermore there’s two new <strong>Semi-static ropes</strong> coming, two new <strong>carabiners</strong>, the <strong>ALCANADRE</strong>, a large volume pack for transporting canyoning equipment and the <strong>BUG</strong>, a small backpack for single-day multi-pitch climbing.</p>

<h2 id="rjk">Röjk</h2>

<p>Doesn’t the <a href="http://rojksuperwear.com/en/">Röjk</a> booth look fantastic? Of course it does - Linus &amp; Jan shanghaied me in helping it putting it up! </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/20287797785/in/album-72157656356655229/" title="Röjk"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/315/20287797785_a0bb2fee35_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Röjk" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>That’s the Guys PrimaLoft Zippen Hood in purple, which rocks. It’s a S.O.A. Winner, too. But new is the <strong>Guys PrimaLoft Drifter Hood</strong> that Linus models underneath. It’s a lighter weight hoody jacket. The PrimaLoft Polyester makes it lightweight and nicely soft on the skin, is wicking very fast while the Merino wool makes it stay fresh. The cool look makes it a fine choice for chilling at the campfire or going to town. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/20261528726/in/album-72157656356655229/" title="Röjk Guys PrimaLoft Drifter Hood"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3791/20261528726_0343b99044_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Röjk Guys PrimaLoft Drifter Hood" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Somehow I managed to not take a photo of Röjk’s new T-Shirt designs for the <strong>SuperTee</strong>, which is a shame because they were awesome. Röjk continues their Inka, Maya &amp; Aztec theme with very pretty designs on their 60% Merino wool &amp; 40% Modal shirts for Chicks and Guys, so please excuse the absence of the photos and believe me: They rock. What I did photograph, though, is the new <strong>Chicks &amp; Guys Roamer Hoody</strong>. These are made from Merino wool and Lyocell for a lightweight and comfortable backpacking hoody that stays fresh and cool for a long time. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19665161864/in/album-72157656356655229/" title="Röjk Chicks &amp; Guys Roamer Hoody"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/473/19665161864_18f7e5c3ce_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Röjk Chicks &amp; Guys Roamer Hoody" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Sadly not pictured are the great looking <strong>SuperTank</strong> tops, which are made from Merino wool and Modal and also come in sick Inca patterns. What I can show you is the <strong>PrimaLoft Hiker Lightweight Sock</strong> which should be super breathable thanks to the open mesh structure on top and help avoid sweaty feet. Made from PrimaLoft Yarn, Merino wool and Polyamide they should be durable, keeping your toes warm, dry and looking good!  </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19666843133/in/album-72157656356655229/" title="Röjk PrimaLoft Hiker Lightweight Sock"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/552/19666843133_73ca83b1b6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Röjk PrimaLoft Hiker Lightweight Sock" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Most importantly, you can shop their gear online right now in the <a href="http://rojksuperwear.com/en/">Röjk online shop</a>!</p>

<h2 id="ortovox">Ortovox</h2>

<p>The big news at <a href="http://www.ortovox.de/">Ortovox</a> were the backpacks, especially the <strong>PEAK</strong> which has a unique SWISSWOOL back system that’s made from pressed Swiss wool. The ideas is that in exactly the same way as with clothing you would benefit from the wool’s great moisture and microclimate management and therefore the backpanel feels comfortable and dry on your back. Otherwise the PEAK is a good looking climbing backpack with a c circumferential front zipper for easy access. Will be interesting to see if the backpanel works as imagined or if it just sucks itself full with sweat and stays wet.</p>

<p>The <strong>MERINO SHIELD SHELL (MI) PIZ BADILE JACKET</strong> is from Ortovox’s new softshell line (called, yes, MERINO SHIELD SHELL) and will weigh 353 g (Size ?). The line is made for high-alpine tours and has hence the features you’d want from a jacket for such outings: Freedom of movement, high abrasion-resistance, breathability and comfort. It has a protective shell made from Cordura®, the outer side of front pocket is made of felted wool and has an athletic fit. It was a comfortable jacket and felt very nice.</p>

<h2 id="kitka">Kitka</h2>

<p>It was pretty cool to meet the guys from <a href="http://kitkaclimbing.com">Kitka Climbing</a> at the fair, especially with their own booth! Kitka makes polyurethane climbing holds, handcrafted in Finland, with a lot of unique &amp; cool shapes. They felt great and I reckon I will need to get a few sets for my own boulder wall!</p>

<h2 id="rab">Rab</h2>

<p>As always I enjoyed my visit to <a href="http://rab.equipment/">Rab</a>, and their new kit really rocks. There was a lot of new lightweight gear for the ladies, like the fine <strong>Women’s Flashpoint Jacket</strong> which is made from 3L Pertex Shield+ Fabric and will weigh 160 g for a Women’s 12. It has a helmet compatible hood with a lightweight &amp; flexible polymer peak to keep your eyes dry in the rain. It’s designed as the jacket that you have along in case the rain hits you while you are on a Multi-Pitch route or an alpine ascent, and as it is so light you don’t need to ponder if you take it along. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/20261546376/in/album-72157656356655229/" title="Rab Women’s Flashpoint Jacket"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/303/20261546376_843ff13911_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Rab Women’s Flashpoint Jacket" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>New is also the <strong>Women’s Continuum Jacket</strong> which will be the lightest option in the women’s insulation range at 240 g in Size 12. It’s filled with 100g of 850FP European Goose Down that’s hydrophobic. It will pack down also very small and thus also can always come along on your mountain adventures.</p>

<p>And I liked the new Rock Climbing garments immensely. Functional and stylish, the assortment of pants - from the <strong>Oblique &amp; Rockover Pants</strong> to the <strong>Rampage Jacket</strong> and the many great T-Shirts and hoodies, the Rock Climbing &amp; Lifestyle Collection is great for days at the crag - be it in Kalymnos, Olhava or the Peak District. </p>

<h2 id="sea-to-summit">Sea to Summit</h2>

<p>After not visiting <a href="http://www.seatosummit.com">Sea to Summit</a> in 2014 I was happy to check out what they had new this year. The <strong>XSet Pots</strong> are collapsible cooking pots, which should be ideal with simple gas or alcohol stoves. The bottoms are made from hard anodized aluminium with food-grade &amp; heat-resistant silicone walls that fold down for transport, making for small packages while in your pack. The 3 piece kit consists of a 1,3 l kettle, one 2,8 l pot and a 8” frying pan that weigh together 756 g. The kettle on its own is 186 g and the lightest of the whole series and could be all a lightweight backpacker needs.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/20099778470/in/album-72157656356655229/" title="Sea to Summit XSet Pots"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/433/20099778470_24e75f5526_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Sea to Summit XSet Pots" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>New is also the <strong>Aeros Pillow Ultralight</strong> which will weigh 70 g and packs as big as a Kiwi. If you value a good nights sleep and want a lightweight pillow that is very comfortable, this looks like an interesting new offering to the market. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19666823983/in/album-72157656356655229/" title="Sea to Summit Aeros Pillow Ultralight"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/544/19666823983_8fcaf2283a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Sea to Summit Aeros Pillow Ultralight" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The <strong>Ground Control Tent Pegs</strong> are made from high-quality aluminium, weigh 14 g each and have a luminescent pull loop which is easily seen at night, adding a bit more security to your nightly stumbles around your tent. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/20261534766/in/album-72157656356655229/" title="Sea to Summit Ground Control Tent Pegs"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/508/20261534766_ee6a63a867_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Sea to Summit Ground Control Tent Pegs" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The <strong>Self-Adhesive Lash Points</strong> should be especially interesting for packrafters. These allow you to add extra tie-down points to your packraft, either to tie down gear, install thigh straps or or or. And at 18 g per lash point they’re ultralight, too.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19666827693/in/album-72157656356655229/" title="Sea to Summit Self-Adhesive Lash Points"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/536/19666827693_a44f650efd_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Sea to Summit Self-Adhesive Lash Points" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="vertical-life">Vertical Life</h2>

<p>New at <a href="https://www.vertical-life.info">Vertical-Life</a> was the <strong>Zlag Up!</strong>, a variation on the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/06/zlagboard-pro-review.html">Zlagboard</a> which I use. It’s a smart pull-up bar which works like the Zlagboard with an App on your smartphone to keep track of your training, and as a very special extra there’s the rolley bar which is pretty cool to train your balance.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/20279448742/in/album-72157656356655229/" title="Zlag Up"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3786/20279448742_904d6fd21e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Zlag Up" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The <a href="http://guide.vertical-life.info/en/app/">Climbing App Guides</a> also get a lot of new topos all the time, and you can test the app for South Tyrol’s crags for free (I wish I’d known this before my trip to the Dolomites!). </p>

<h2 id="stay-tuned-for-the-next-part-coming-soon">Stay tuned for the next part, coming soon™!</h2>

<p>As usual you can see a lot more photos in the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/sets/72157656356655229">OutDoor 2015 Flickr Album</a>. Sweet.

<p>My 2nd OutDoor fair was different, and not so different than 2013. This year’s differences included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rain all four days of the fair</li>
  <li>Sleeping on a different camping place in a <a href="http://www.heimplanet.com/">Heimplanet Cave</a></li>
  <li>No Overnighter on a mountain before or after the fair :/</li>
</ul>

<p>But there were lots of similarities to 2013, too:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Travelling via Zürich Airport</li>
  <li>Again 8 to 12 meetings each day</li>
  <li>The best coffee still was had at the Scandinavian Outdoor Bar</li>
  <li>Meeting lots of old and new friends which you usually only communicate online with</li>
</ul>

<p>I mixed things up and had several meetings with companies I haven’t met before - Rock Technologies, Sealskinz, Big Agnes, NEMO Equipment, Vargo and NW Alpine, amongst others. Some of them were for the first time at the fair, others I just didn’t had a chance to meet before. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14671316545" title="Camp HEIMPLANET by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3873/14671316545_dfe7e2d07d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Camp HEIMPLANET" /></a></p>

<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>

<p>I really enjoyed meeting <a href="http://lighthiker.wordpress.com/">Roman</a> and having a chat with him. It was a honour to meet Ron Moak from <a href="http://www.sixmoondesigns.com/">Six Moon Designs</a> and talk ultralight gear with him, as well chat with the owners of fellow Oregon Outdoor businesses <a href="http://www.cilogear.com/">CiloGear</a> and <a href="http://nwalpine.com/">NW Alpine</a>. It was a cool surprise to sit next to Brian <a href="http://www.vargooutdoors.com/">Vargo</a> in the bus to the fair and talk Titanium and ultralight gear with him. And also to meet again <a href="http://www.freiluft-blog.de/">Sven</a> and <a href="http://www.trekking.lu/">Aender</a> whom I have met earlier this year in Luxembourg, as well as <a href="http://www.ausgeruestet.com/">Marcel</a>, fellow outdoor bloggers.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14648597180" title="Zlag Board by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5578/14648597180_529d91d928_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Zlag Board" /></a></p>

<p>Equally cool was some of the gear. The <a href="http://zlagboard.com/">Zlagboard</a> is a really awesome approach to a hangboard with a personal trainer included, and shows what’s possible if you combine technology in a smart way with existing products. I’d love one but the price tag of close to 300€ probably will put it out of reach of just the most rich climbers.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14646350483" title="Hilleberg Enan by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3868/14646350483_068b962779_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Hilleberg Enan" /></a></p>

<p>I’m not a tent person but the Hilleberg Enan looked very great. A 1,1 kg double wall tent likely will fly off the shelves for Hilleberg as all the traditional backpackers will run to lighten up their packs with one. There were obviously a bunch of other lightweight tent designs, some with good ideas and details, but this one stood out for me.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14431823760" title="Arc&#x27;teryx Footwear by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3850/14431823760_04ee0da90d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Arc&#x27;teryx Footwear" /></a></p>

<p>I liked the Arc’teryx footwear line. While not a new idea the shoes I tried on and played around with were extremely well made and had a great fit. I can see myself using the Alpha² FL model as its a multiple-use shoe that works for the trail, camp, crossing rivers and should dry fast, which could be great in wet and cold environments.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14589445398" title="Salomon S-Lab Alp Carbon GTX by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3843/14589445398_8ec27437af_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Salomon S-Lab Alp Carbon GTX" /></a></p>

<p>And while I’m not a boot person the Salomon S-Lab Alp Carbon GTX definitely is on my list of gear-to-try. A sub 400 g boot that’s crampon compatible likely will open up new possibilities for ice climbing, mountaineering and alpinism, and even will be interesting for those people who just like the support of a boot but wouldn’t mind if it’s lighter.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14624305174" title="MSR Reactor and MSR WindBoiler by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5584/14624305174_b17f444bfc_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="MSR Reactor and MSR WindBoiler" /></a></p>

<p>The MSR Windboiler was an interesting stove design: Fairly light and as there’s no need for a windscreen it makes it useable also in very windy situations without much fussing around. I’m curious to see how it would perform next to the Reactor and the new <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/07/outdoor-news-2014-day-3.html">Jetboil MiniMo</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14671477415" title="Outdoor Research ActiveIce &amp; Spectrum Sun Sleeves by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3925/14671477415_98ef393272_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Outdoor Research ActiveIce &amp; Spectrum Sun Sleeves" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14484714858" title="Impressions by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5566/14484714858_16f97f8905_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Impressions" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14447506168" title="ORTOVOX Rock&#x27;N&#x27;Wool Double Check Shirt by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2929/14447506168_633cb20f00_b.jpg" width="880" height="1024" alt="ORTOVOX Rock&#x27;N&#x27;Wool Double Check Shirt" /></a></p>

<p>On the garment front there were a few items that caught my interest: I liked the Outdoor Research ActiveIce Sun Sleeves (and would wish I’d have a pair in this weather) and loved the fabric, feel and colours of the new ORTOVOX Rock’n’Wool garments. Also the Haglöfs L.I.M. line is super interesting and I hope that it will be popular as that will benefit us ultralight hikers a lot. </p>

<h2 id="copy-cats">Copy Cats</h2>

<p>I’m usually not shaming stuff or companies - I rather write about what’s really good and worth doing. But seeing two successful products blatantly copied had my blood boiling. Packrafting is growing and attracts a growing number of people from all walks of outdoor life. That’s why it’s pretty shite to see <a href="http://www.alpackaraft.com/">Alpacka Packrafts</a> copied nearly 1:1 by the German company Faltboot. But apparently that wasn’t enough for them - once you start copying it’s apparently difficult to stop. Otherwise I can’t fathom why they also copied the <a href="http://www.orukayak.com/">Oru Kayak</a>, the foldable &amp; lightweight kayak. Worst of all is that the company seems to claim to have had the idea to both these designs and thinks we consumers are stupid and don’t know (well, if you’d see the mainstream media who has picked up e.g. on the “new” packraft, you’d easily could come to that conclusion). While there might be tiny, tiny differences in design or material, for me it was very obvious from where those guys took their inspiration. My advice to all those interested in packrafting and foldable kayaks: Support the original companies with the better designs and materials and avoid the copy cats.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14648685508" title="Packraft and Oru Kayak Rip-Off from Faltboote.de by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5589/14648685508_18733d8713_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Packraft and Oru Kayak Rip-Off from Faltboote.de" /></a></p>

<h2 id="trends">Trends</h2>

<p>There were a lot of single rope belay device on show, and with gym/ sports climbing booming across the globe it’s a logical development. Of the ones shown at the show I liked the Salewa one best, but only using them at the crag will show which one will reign supreme. I’m already using the <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/mammut-smart-sicherungsgeraet/">Mammut Smart</a> since many years and like it a lot, and the Salewa Belay System improved upon that design a bit in my opinion. We’ll see. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14439188508" title="Salewa Belay Device by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3914/14439188508_7e226cb577_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Salewa Belay Device" /></a></p>

<p>Cuben becomes mainstream and is picked up by large companies. Both Adidas and Peak Performance have made a jacket (and pants) of breathable cuben which might be the first nail into the coffin of other WPB fabrics. These will be limited numbers I reckon, and pricey, but if they sell out I am sure we’ll see more of it next year. Also otherwise cuben was used for packs and tents, but I wasn’t convinced that those companies knew much about the material - otherwise they wouldn’t have designed e.g. a 90 l backpack with all bells &amp; whistles of it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14773743944" title="Peak Performance Cuben Suit by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3874/14773743944_3e6a346289_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Peak Performance Cuben Suit" /></a></p>

<p>Kids and children are increasingly recognized as a target group. There’s already family hiking specific magazines so it’s no surprise that we see each year a growing number of companies who garner to the outdoor gear needs of the little ones. Strollers, carriers, packs, sleeping bags and clothes - there’s not much gear that isn’t yet made for kids. But instead of smaller sizes of proven designs this kit is often adapted to the needs of the kids - reinforced knees, seats and elbows on garments, sleeping bags that are warmer &amp; allow for a lot of freedom of movement and comfy carriers &amp; strollers are available, as well as specific gear for moms and dads. It’s an interesting segment and my son &amp; me are curious to see what the future of it holds.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14457708637" title="Patagonia by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2940/14457708637_e5c809a8b1_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Patagonia" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14439966147" title="Thule Glider &amp; Chariot by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5589/14439966147_01412b5f1c_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Thule Glider &amp; Chariot" /></a></p>

<p>What also changed is that there were less <a href="http://www.outdoor-show.de/od-de/programm/industry-award.php">OutDoor Awards</a>. This year there were 35 OutDoor Industry Awards of which seven were Gold. These OutDoor Industry 2014 Gold Award winners are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Atmos AG 65 from Osprey</li>
  <li>Speed Ascent by Salewa</li>
  <li>HyperSmock 2.0 by Berghaus</li>
  <li>Winter Gas by Primus</li>
  <li>Alpha² FL Men’s by Arc‘teryx</li>
  <li>The Fuseform™ Originator Jacket from The North Face and</li>
  <li>100 % plant-based PES from Toray</li>
</ul>

<p>I think almost all of these deserve the award, as a lightweight backpacker it’s always good to see that innovative, light gear gets rewarded. That Primus Winter Gas probably will be very popular if it works as advertised, and I’m looking forward to try on and test the first 100 % plant-based PES fabric garments from Toray. </p>

<p>In general gear is getting lighter and more durable, but again also increasingly the companies pay attention to the natural and social environment in which they operate. Gear is made closer to where the consumer lives, old locations are getting a second life and also what the gear is made of is not just on the consumer side, but also on the manufacturer side increasingly of importance. Maybe we’ll see silk tarps with a modern twist in a few years, as well as linen pants and hemp shirts!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14642036254" title="Marmot Eclipse Tunnel 2P by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2902/14642036254_c854021611_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Marmot Eclipse Tunnel 2P" /></a></p>

<p>While last years/ this year’s <em>trend sport</em> was trailrunning - which continues to be popular - I felt that climbing is growing even further as a sport, attracting people from diverse backgrounds to try out this wonderful past time. But also hiking and backpacking seem to have a 2nd spring and at least on the company side I feel they’re becoming more popular again. I think we haven’t yet seen the end of the outdoor boom, and with this great weather it’s easy to see why people want to go outdoors.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>It was another interesting, busy fair. Between walking from meeting to meeting there sadly was too little time to check out some of the other companies at the fair - though honestly, with over 900 exhibitors that’s probably impossible either way. I think that I will maintain to make appointments with companies in the future - it’s a lot more useful for me to learn about products in detail in 30 to 60 minutes, try them on and speak with the designer than running from booth to booth trying to take it all in. Already with the meetings the fair is overwhelming at times and things start to look and feel the same, so by taking it in in small doses I feel I’m taking away more. However, maybe next year I will have one day for strolling around. Even if it means I will have fewer USB sticks and catalogues to carry home.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14649325249" title="OutDoor 2014 catalogues &amp; USB sticks by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5569/14649325249_1e5bd51f05_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="OutDoor 2014 catalogues &amp; USB sticks" /></a></p>

<p>There was some good gear on the show that will make climbing, mountaineering, camping, hiking and backpacking more comfortable/ safe/ easy/ hard/ cool/ fun/ whatever in 2015. I saw a few innovative products, smart use of fabrics in garments, nice colours (I’m still not back in black) and a lot of gear that was on a diet and has lost weight. Some of it really might be great while others might not make it past one trip and are deemed not good. Only rigour testing in the outdoors will show us that and I hope that I will be able to put some of the gear presented here through that process. And if I like it, and it’s good, you’ll read about it in a <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/gear-reviews/">gear review</a> in due time.</p>

<p>The far best part of the fair continues to be the people. I missed some friends but met many others and it’s great to grab a beer with them after the day on the floor, talk about what one has seen and get some tips about interesting kit to go check out. I’ve made a bunch of new mates and am looking forward to welcome a handful of them very soon here in Finland. Will I be in Friedrichshafen in 2015? Possibly maybe. It’s an expensive trip for me, time away from my family and also time I could spend outdoors. But it’s a lot of fun, too, and being able to report for you about the latest gear developments is enjoyable. I hope you have enjoyed this years news and read about something you liked.</p>

<h2 id="supernatural">super.natural</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.supern8ural.com/en/about.htm">super.natural</a> hails from München and they like to combine Merino wool with durable polyester fibres. The result are yarns that offer the best of both materials and these are then sewn into some very nice garments. They have a Women’s Yoga range which looked super comfy while being very stylish - garments that could be used for climbing &amp; hiking in the blink of an eye. But really any of their garments from the Base, Training and Superfly ranges could do well outdoors while still looking good when returning to the city. I tried some garments on and really liked them - good fit, freedom of movement, soft on the skin and they let light.</p>

<h2 id="true-mountain">True Mountain</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.true-mountain.com/">True Mountain</a> makes gear in the UK from European and British materials. It’s a good effort, helping to re-establish the skills needed to sew and build high-quality kit in the UK, creating jobs and being - thanks to shorter transports - more environmentally friendly. Their gear goes on sale this autumn and will start with functional boxers which will be followed later on by tops, wind jackets and more. You can <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TrueMountainUK">follow their progress on FB</a>.</p>

<h2 id="aarn-packs">Aarn Packs</h2>

<p>All <a href="http://www.aarnpacks.com/">Aarn Packs</a> get a more streamlined, clean look. They’ve been optimized in several ways, and should now be even more suitable to runners, backpackers and hikers alike. </p>

<h2 id="mountain-network">Mountain Network</h2>

<p>Now something for the climbing gym owners and climbing clubs: <a href="http://www.mountain-network.eu/">Mountain Network</a> has created a climbing wall system that is self-bearing and that can be used indoors &amp; outdoors. Prefabricated elements allow you to build a tower like the one underneath in a day which makes them not just ideal for events, but also for hotels and other places which want to have a climbing wall e.g. over the summer outside and then store it away when the winter comes. It’s not just ideal to build climbing walls but also for bouldering walls. <a href="http://www.mountain-network.eu/klimwanden/klimwanden/driehoek-klimwanden/algemene-informatie/">Check out the video and photos on their site</a>, it’s pretty cool - so cool that it won an OutDoor Award!</p>

<h2 id="mountain-hardwear">Mountain Hardwear</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.mountainhardwear.com/">Mountain Hardwear</a> Stretch Ozonic jacket is a 276 g 2.5-layer shell with good stretch. It’s made from the Dry.Q® Active fabric which has a ‘soft shell’ feel with the benefits and light weight of a hard-shell. It felt nice and Mountain Hardwear claims this is a great wet weather hiking jacket, so it could be interesting for those that prefer to walk in the rain and not this hot weather!</p>

<p>The Quasar™ Lite Jacket is 340 g light and uses another Mountain Hardwear fabric, Dry.Q™ Elite. It’s also a 2.5 layer shell but has two harness/ hipbelt compatible pockets with a mesh lining that help with venting. </p>

<p>Mountain Hardwear uses OutDry in some of their packs, and the newest addition is the Scrambler 30. OutDry makes this pack’s main compartment completely waterproof. It has a 30 l volume and weighs 770 g and can carry between four and 11 kg. The waistbelt is stowable and you can carry your skis, ice tools or trekking poles. A versatile pack that should keep your gear dry in any situation.</p>

<p>The Mountain Hardwear Optic tent series gives you grand vistas through the possibility to open two adjacent doors for 180° views. The Optic 6 gives this possibility now to your next family camping trip. Not a lightweight shelter by any means at almost 7 kg, it does offer plenty of space - six adults could sleep in there, but please don’t move much in your sleep then. I think it’d be good for a family with two to three kids. At 500€ it’s certainly cheaper than many other camping tents where you can stand in, and divided between a family it is even lightweight when hiking. </p>

<h2 id="tenaya">Tenaya</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.tenaya.net/index.php">Tenaya</a> makes climbing shoes. I decided to swing by and see what this company from Spain has to offer to us climbers and tried their <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/tenaya-oasi-kletterschuhe/?pid=81">Oasi</a> on. Wow. It’s hands down the most comfy climbing shoe I have worn - and that while also allowing for precision on small holds and hooking. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AlexanderMegosSportler">Alex Megos</a> wears them, and he certainly knows a thing to two about climbing and shoes. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14776098195" title="Tenayah Oasi by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3839/14776098195_1ec22697e0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Tenayah Oasi" /></a></p>

<p>But the Oasi isn’t new. The Tarifa is. It is a laced shoe and is designed for versatile performance and comfort on rock. It has a Vibram XS Grip 3.5 mm sole and is similarly constructed like the Oasi - I’d say it’s the Oasi with laces instead of the Velcro closure system. Definitely a shoe to try on if you have a chance, as its comfy with great performance. </p>

<h2 id="rock-technologies">Rock Technologies</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.rocktechnologies.co.uk/">Rock Technologies</a> is the UK’s largest manufacturer of loose chalk and chalk balls, as well as several other climbing-related gear. They’re in business since 2001 and Richard, the owner started in his mother’s garage until the business was getting to big and dusty! Now they produce their high-quality chalk products in the UK and Austria, and they use only medical grade magnesium carbonate which minimizes health risks. Other products are a power putty for training and finger tape - I got some of the gear here on test and will report back after use.</p>

<h2 id="goal-zero">Goal Zero</h2>

<p>Power on the go - with <a href="http://bit.ly/1rXAMAH">Goal Zero</a> no problem. The Rock Out2 Solar Speaker is well suited for those backpacking parties where you don’t have a guitar along but need some tunes. The speaker hooks up via Bluetooth or a audio jack to your phone and gives an adequate sound for your next beach or outdoor party - 20 hours long or as long as the sun shines.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14663080042" title="Goalzero Rock Out2 Solar Speaker by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3854/14663080042_8539a3684b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Goalzero Rock Out2 Solar Speaker" /></a></p>

<p>The Torch 250 is a torch that can be powered via the solar panel or the crank. It has a between 70 and 180 Lumen depending on the mode you choose, and also has a red light. I wouldn’t carry it on a backpacking trip, but if you need a torch in your house or car for emergencies and don’t want to also have many batteries to power it, this would be the best alternative.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14476811188" title="Goalzero Torch 250 by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5594/14476811188_190f7a35ef_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Goalzero Torch 250" /></a></p>

<p>A piece of gear that certainly is something for backpackers is the Switch 10 Set. It consists of the Nomad 7 Solar Panel, Goal Zero Switch 10 Recharger and three add-on for the latter: A Ventilator (made from silicone so folds up), a USB to Mini-USB converter and a torch. These connect to the Switch 10 (which packs some more power than the current Switch 8). Weight will be probably a bit over 500 g all included, but if you only take what you need that goes down. The panel itself can store all the gear in a mesh pocket on the back and be strapped to your pack so you can power up while you hike.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14476815358" title="Goal Zero Switch 10 Set by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5494/14476815358_a17417670f_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Goal Zero Switch 10 Set" /></a></p>

<h2 id="pramo">Páramo</h2>

<p><a href="http://paramo.co.uk/en-gb/index.php">Páramo</a> introduced three fleece/ windproof duos that use their innovative combination of Nikwax® Fleece with Nikwax® Windproof fabrics to create a versatile system. On their own both the fleeces and windproofs are water-repellent and able to hold off a rain shower. However, when worn together they provide the equivalent protection to a Páramo Analogy® Waterproof. And all of that PFC-free! Interesting for mountaineers and climbers is the Men’s Enduro &amp; Ladies’ Ventura Fleece/ Windproof Systems, these have an athletic fit, are harness, helmet and glove compatible and both have (aligned) hoods. The Men’s Bora &amp; Ladies’ Zonda duos are for hill walkers and backpackers, while the Men’s Bentu is for the everyday walker. Nice garments, made by a company that takes environmental and social matters serious and makes good efforts to make the (outdoor) world a better place.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14589599957" title="Páramo by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3870/14589599957_442af65f57_b.jpg" width="862" height="1024" alt="Páramo" /></a></p>

<p>The company also launched an Active Travel Collection, made of cool, protective and lightweight garments. They’re made of the Nikwax fabrics Parameta A and Cotton+ which keep you cool and provide protection against UV rays and biting insects. I imagine this would work well for backpacking in hot regions or just as casual garments in the office and town. </p>

<h2 id="scandinavian-outdoor-group">Scandinavian Outdoor Group</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.scandinavianoutdoorgroup.com/">Scandinavian Outdoor Group</a> not just has the tastiest coffee on the fair at the SOG Bar, but also unites the best outdoor brands from the north. The SOG Press Conference was an interesting event to attend, where 13 companies presented themselves and their newest creations. The SOG also heads out before each fair and tests kit that has been submitted for consideration for the prestigious SOG Award, which this time went again to Röjk and their PrimaLoft Zippen Hood. There were lots of great presentations with heaps of humour, which shows that the North not just builds some high-quality gear but also can have a laugh about themselves =)</p>

<h2 id="big-agnes">Big Agnes</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.bigagnes.com/">Big Agnes</a> is still pretty hard to get in Europe so it was nice to check out their gear and meet the team. The Fly Creek UL 2 looked pretty cool and also won a OutDoor Award, and at packed weight of 1.050 g for the 2 Person version it’s a pretty impressive looking shelter. If you are hiking with a tablet or Kindle, install the Entertainment Center Loft inside and you can read or view a movie while lying down or sitting in the tent.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14476728320" title="Big Agnes Fly Creek UL 2 by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2900/14476728320_c3dc5d9a36_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Big Agnes Fly Creek UL 2" /></a>

<p>The Double Z Air Pad will be available as an Insulated version and should keep you warm when it gets cold. Pack size looked good, as did the thickness and size of the pad. It’s gonna be 595 g light in the 183 x 51 cm size and uses PrimaLoft Silver Hi-Loft as an insulation material to achieve an R-Value of 4.5.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14661141894" title="Big Agnes Insulated Double Z Air Pad by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3896/14661141894_49fc01c9fa_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Big Agnes Insulated Double Z Air Pad" /></a></p>

<p>Finally, mtnGlo™ is a really smart way to illuminate your shelter at night. Flexible LEDs are sewn into several of the Big Agnes models available, like the Copper Spur UL2 and UL3, Rattlesnake SL1 - SL4, Ripple Creek UL2+ and several more. But Big Agnes also thought about those tent users who don’t want to buy a new tent but would like to enjoy mtnGlo™ light inside, and that’s where the mtnGlo™ Tent Light Accessory Kit comes in handy. It’s a 254 cm long LED strand with Power pack that you can easily clip into the ceiling of your tent or shelter and <em>Voilá</em> - it’s light! Clips are included, the whole package is 84 g and is powered by three AAA batteries. </p>

<h2 id="salomon">Salomon</h2>

<p><a href="http://bit.ly/1qffpI5">Salomon</a> presented a sub 400 g, crampon compatible mountaineering boot, the Salomon S-Lab Alp Carbon GTX. It uses a carbon fibre midsole that is laterally stable but otherwise flexible. A Contragrip sole, a Sensifit upper with GTX lining &amp; Quicklace closure, this is the shoe for all those that like to run mountains up. I’m generally not a boot type, but this is a boot I’m excited about.</p>

<p>Flowtech is Salomon’s idea of venting on strenuous ascents where you don’t want to take the jacket off. Just open the zippers, roll the front up and keep it in place with the bungee cord. Good idea, but how will it work in the field?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14640394336" title="Salomon by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5570/14640394336_bc32c5c9d3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Salomon" /></a></p>

<p>The Ellipse Sport W is Salomon’s Women-only shoe. It has a women’s last and design and is from their hiking/ sports line, so could be a suitable hiking shoe for the ladies. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14663377945" title="Salomon Ellipse Sport W by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5544/14663377945_3c5b68268c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Salomon Ellipse Sport W" /></a></p>

<p>The S-Lab Sense 4 Ultra SG goes into round four. The rubber on the sole has been made a bit more durable, so you might now get two Ultras out of one pair ;) It’s still as grippy and light as the ones before it - a fine shoe, slightly better.</p>

<p>The Speedcross 3 continues to be one of Salomon’s most popular shoes and now get updated colours for 2015, including Camo, which means finally hunters and Bushcrafters can wear them. </p>

<h2 id="sealskinz">Sealskinz</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.sealskinz.com/UK/?skip_welcome_popup">Sealskinz</a> is also a company which I have read about a lot but have never tried their gear, so it was nice to put on some of their socks and gloves. The socks felt comfy warm and I can imagine them working well in wet weather or in winter when skiing, snow shoeing or ice climbing. The gloves had a good fit and the different models I tried on gave me quickly warm hands! There were a couple of models which I think could work well for winter mountaineering/ hiking and ice climbing, though for me they might be too warm to use in summer. </p>

<h2 id="jetboil">Jetboil</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.jetboil.com/">Jetboil</a> killed the Sol (Ti) cooking system. The company realized it’s too specialist and that the Ti pot and aluminium heat exchanger didn’t get along well, so the new stove for 2015 is the MiniMo. It’s a 415 g system with a wide, low pot that in my indoor test at the OutDoor boiled 1 l of water in 3:08 minutes. The pot is easier to attach to the stove unit and the stoves valve and regulator have been redesigned and were easier to use and you can put the flame really low - it actually might be possible to cook in it now. There’s still the Piezo ignition on it, and the pot also got a pair of silicone-covered metal handles. Those cozies are interchangeable, and there’s four different ones available from the time the MiniMo hits the shelves. </p>

<h2 id="ortovox">Ortovox</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.ortovox.de/">Ortovox</a> introduces a really cool looking Cargo Pants which is made from Cordura® Wool - a mix of 55% Merino wool and 45% Cordura with an ecorepel® finish which makes it dirt and water-repellant and is PFC-free. Stretch inserts and an athletic cut mean you’ll have freedom of movement in these, and for very hot summer days there will also be a Shorts available from the same material - also in some cool colours. Supergeil they look, especially in orange. Equally Supergeil is the Rock’N’Wool Double Check Shirt which I sport here. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14447506168" title="ORTOVOX Rock&#x27;N&#x27;Wool Double Check Shirt by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2929/14447506168_633cb20f00_b.jpg" width="880" height="1024" alt="ORTOVOX Rock&#x27;N&#x27;Wool Double Check Shirt" /></a></p>

<p>The 100% Merino wool shirt in a light 133 g/ m2 quality which makes it well suited for summer use. It combines all the good stuff you like about Merino wool with a kickass style - gone the times of boring black shirts. You probably want to wear a pair of Sports Rock’N’Wool Cool socks with the shirt &amp; pants or shorts. What looks like you dressed in a hurry in the morning actually is on purpose: The socks are of different colours. And they employ Tencel which cools your feet, which makes them ideal for the tropic temperatures we currently enjoy in Finland. </p>

<p>On those fresh summer 2015 evening you can put on the Swisswool Light Tec Vest. It’s swiss wool - wool which in the past was treated as waste as the fibres are too short. But Ortovox figured out how to use the wool - as an insulation material in their Swisswool garments. The Vest here will weigh 263 g and has a fine hood, zipper pockets that are sitting high on the vest and thus won’t interfere with your hipbelt or harness.</p>

<h2 id="mountain-equipment">Mountain Equipment</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.mountain-equipment.com/">Mountain Equipment</a> from the UK has a few nice pieces coming for the next year. I like off-set zippers so I did enjoy trying on the Squall Hooded Jacket. It’s a climbing softshell jacket, 310 g light and retails for 120€. It’s a climbing specific fit with good freedom of movement, articulated sleeves and a helmet compatible hood. The asymmetric zipper not just looks good, it’s also practical as so the zipper won’t rub against the front of your chin/ face. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14447709677" title="Mountain Equipment Squall Hooded Jacket by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5471/14447709677_8e3652e80c_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Mountain Equipment Squall Hooded Jacket" /></a></p>

<p>The Kinesis Jacket will be a 325 g Polartec Alpha garment and from the quick test at the booth convinced me with a good fit, being stowable in its own pocket and a nice waffle fleece lining on the sleeves and hood. It uses the ME Helium 30 fabric as a shell which makes it windproof. It was a good fit and should work well on its own or as a midlayer under a shell/ windjacket for some extra warmth.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14447499859" title="Mountain Equipment Kinesis Jacket by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5593/14447499859_0f1dd52ef9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Mountain Equipment Kinesis Jacket" /></a></p>

<p>The Foil Jacket is a 85 g wind jacket with an interesting hem drawstring. It’s going above the butt as you can see underneath, so that the fabric covering your buttocks - which is longer - has some movement. This might mean the jacket won’t ride up as jacket with drawstring at the hem often do - testing will show this in the future. It has thumbloops, articulated sleeves and packs into its own chest pocket.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14633664532" title="Mountain Equipment Foil Jacket by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3905/14633664532_26582576e6_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Mountain Equipment Foil Jacket" /></a></p>

<p>The Aurora Synthetic sleeping bag uses Climashield Apex for insulation, the same material many cottages uses in their quilts. There’s three models available with Comfort ratings of 3°C, -1°C and -4°C and will start at 180€. They have a wind-resistant shell fabric, a 3/4 zipper and a collar, and if the weight is good (don’t know, sorry) these might be interesting for those that prefer synthetic sleeping bags.</p>

<h2 id="primaloft">PrimaLoft</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.primaloft.com/uk/performance/home.html">PrimaLoft</a> showed off their Performance Down Blend material, a material that combines European down (EDFA and ADFC monitored) with PrimaLoft microfibres. The down is given a PFC-free water-repellent coating and then is <em>bound homogenously with the ultra-fine PrimaLoft® fibers that root the water-repellent qualities permanently in the fibers so they cannot be washed out.</em> It’s supposed to retain its structure even when wet and more than 90% of the heat is still stored then, too. It’s bluesign certified and I got a down short with the material here so will put those claims to the test in a bit - right now it’s a bit too hot to wear them.</p>

<h2 id="rab">Rab</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://rab.uk.com/">Rab</a> Guidebook was hands down the best workbook/ catalogue I was given at the entire fair. Five Rab athletes tell stories in it, and Rab highlights six clothing systems in it. Gorgeous photos, superb layout and typography choices, these are the small highlights at the fair which delight me. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14531665589" title="Rab 2015 Guidebook by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3871/14531665589_dc52bccf53_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Rab 2015 Guidebook" /></a></p>

<p>Oh, the gear from them wasn’t bad, either. The Polar Bedding Bag allows you to store your sleep system largely uncompressed on top of your pulka. I can see how you can use this even as a groundsheet in a snow cave or similar - just throw the Polar Bedding Bag in, open the zipper and lay down in bed. It’s a 800 g heavy item, so you really will want to have that pulka to transport it. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14447698807" title="Rab Polar Bedding Bag &amp; Pulk Bag by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2927/14447698807_98fe2b4331_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Rab Polar Bedding Bag &amp; Pulk Bag" /></a></p>

<p>The MeCo shirts get updated colours including striped versions, but most importantly now all garments will also be available in a women’s fit. So get ready to give your better half a lovely MeCo hoody, Meco Boxers and MeCo pants.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14634111675" title="Rab MeCo line by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2937/14634111675_387a9d0466_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Rab MeCo line" /></a></p>

<p>The Vapour-rise family has gotten a couple of additions with the Women’s Vapour-rise Flex Jacket and for men there will be the Vapour-rise Flex Pull-On, Flex Vest and Flex Jacket. These use, as you might guess from the name, Vapour-rise in the front and back with stretch side panels. These are more minimalist and will tip the scales at 180 g for the vest and 250 g for the Pull-On.</p>

<p>The Ventus and Lunar (for the Ladies) Jackets pictured underneath are made from the Matrix SWS fabric with a Polygiene treatment. They’re windshells that are breathable, have an under the helmet hood, thumbloops and weigh 335 g for the Men and 255 g for the Women. </p>

<h2 id="haglfs">Haglöfs</h2>

<p>The Swedes from <a href="http://www.haglofs.com/en-US/">Haglöfs</a> have (re-)discovered L.I.M. and have created an outfit (pants, midlayer, shell jacket, shoes) and backpack with sleeping bag that’s a mighty fine 1.492 g. Throw in your shelter and cooking system of choice and you could end up with a SUL setup. Costs for the outfit and gear will set you back probably an amount similar to the weight, but lets ignore the money for a moment and concentrate on the fact that here’s a global outdoor company that has created a very light outfit, sleeping bag and backpack. While we have seen many UL attempts in the past from several companies it often were stand-alone pieces - a windjacket here, a light pants there. But here you get a complete outfit, in rocking materials and colours if I may say so. That’s pretty nifty.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14532836337" title="Haglöfs L.I.M. by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3838/14532836337_c54a6fc73c_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Haglöfs L.I.M." /></a></p>

<p>OK, lets look a bit at the different components. The L:I:M: Down sleeping bag uses a 7D shell fabric and 800 cuin, bluesign certified down. It’s 473 g and has no zipper, but the foot box is open so you could just slip it over your head. Or walk with your sleeping bag outside at night when you can’t hold it anymore (pull it up before you let it run, though). It has a +6°C Comfort rating so is something for those sumer hikes.</p>

<p>The L.I.M. Low shoe weighs 220 g in UK Size 8. It has a 5 mm heel drop, some rear cushioing, a water-repellant mesh upper (water-repellant mesh?) and the idea is, yes, fast hiking. The sole looked and felt grippy and it’s a super flexible shoe.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14739134983" title="Haglöfs L.I.M. Low by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3839/14739134983_d7163b9ce1_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Haglöfs L.I.M. Low" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14532619168" title="Haglöfs L.I.M. Low by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3887/14532619168_32f0b71853_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Haglöfs L.I.M. Low" /></a></p>

<p>The L.I.M. Wind Pull is a 65 g (Size L) wind shirt, made from a 7D fabric. It has a DWR coating so will be a bit water-repellant. It has a hood and a long zipper and even a zippered Napoleon pocket. The 175 g (Size L) L.I.M. II Trek Pant are made from a polyamide/ polyester double weave fabric that’s bluesign certified. UPF 30, quick-drying and comfy, soft feeling on the skin. Nice. Then there’s the Midlayer, the 155 g (Size L, you guessed it)  L.I.M. Power Dry Top. It uses Polartec PowerDry fabric, that awesome material that wicks sweat super-fast away and makes you feel dry and warm. Long zipper, zippered chest pocket. Besides the garments there’s several shell jackets and pants, down and synthetic insulation jackets, a softshell, shorts, T-Shirts and longsleeves and a hoody - all very light: The heaviest L.I.M. garment is the Active Jacket which weighs 350 g. </p>

<p>And then there’s still the L.I.M. backpack. 355 g, frameless, 25 l volume (it felt bigger), a good compression system, a zippered lid pocket and two elastic side pockets, this was a high-riding pack that felt pretty good. How it really carries with a UL load and a week’s food we’ll need to test.</p>

<h2 id="suunto">Suunto</h2>

<p><a href="http://bit.ly/1qInObH">Suunto</a> launched the Ambit3 Peak and Sport. For us outdoor-types the Peak is of interest, though both are Bluetooth compatible. The Movescount app will get an update shortly which will allow you to update Movescount on the go via your iPhone or iPad. The watch itself can also communicate with the new Bluetooth accessories and has the ABC and GPS tools you know from the Ambit already. </p>

<h2 id="la-sportiva">La Sportiva</h2>

<p><a href="http://lasportiva.com/">La Sportiva</a> has won a OutDoor Award with their Primer GTX shoe, which is a 390 g (per shoe) Gore-Tex Surround shoe. The <em>SURROUND technology guarantees unequalled breathability, thanks to the breathable surface that makes up the upper and the midsole</em>. That cool, H.R. Giger-esque look also has some function, and is called a Nano-Cells construction method. These should be breathable cells, give structure to the shoe and promote the elimination of humidity. It’s like you have an alien on your feet! The Primer GTX is a traditional lacing shoe while the Synthesis GTX is amid-cut boot with a quick-lace system (and is 395 g per shoe). Both have Ortholite insoles and Vibram soles that look grippy. </p>

<p>The Genius is the Italians latest climbing shoe and is made for sport, trad, free climbing and normal to wide volume feet. The pair is 440 g, it has a 3 mm Vibram XSGrip2 sole and a suede leather combined with microfiber upper. The No-Edge technology means the the shoe adapts better to the rock because of the larger surface of the shoe that comes in contact with the holds.  The asymmetric lacing system should make for a good fit and the P3 stands for Permanent Power Platform which should make the shoe more long-lasting as it helps with keeping the down-turned shape over time.</p>

<p>The Mutant is a new Mountain Running shoe. 320 g per shoe, 10 mm drop, a FriXion XF ultra grippy sole and an integrated gaiter, it looked like a very fine shoe for running or lightweight hiking. The lacing system is called FusionGate and allows for volume regulation in the heel and foot adherence. </p>

<p>Finally, the Helios SR is a 240 g, 2 mm drop shoe. Mesh uppers for breathability, a 4 mm Ortholite Mountain Running Ergonomic insole, again a FriXion XT ultra grippy sole for grip on any terrain and a slip-on construction, it’s an interesting, lightweight shoe.</p>

<h2 id="montane">Montane</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.montane.co.uk/">Montane</a> has established itself since a while as a serious company when it comes to lightweight, durable and functional garments. Their 2015 line continues with these premises. The Featherlite Shell Jacket with eVent DVStorm membrane technology weighs 298 g in Size M and is a fully featured alpine climbing shell. It will give you the freedom of movement and protection you need during stormy ascents or even climbing the sky, as I so aptly demonstrate here.</p>

<p>The Habu 22 is one of two new Montane packs for women (the other one is the Yarará 32). It’s 917 g light and is a versatile pack that’s suited to any activity you might want to do with it: Strap your ice tools to it and go ice climbing or take it on a summer ultra distance run. </p>

<p>The Rapide Softshell Jacket has a hood that stows away in the collar. On your head it has a snug fit and won’t flap annoying around while you’re running in the drizzle, and it weighs 346 g. </p>

<h2 id="nemo-equipment">NEMO Equipment</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.nemoequipment.com/">NEMO Equipment</a> has 8 new tents coming out in 2015, one tarp, and a whole bunch of more gear. The Dagger 2P is a 1,6 kg two person tent with two doors and two vestibules. Features include an overhead pocket light and a privacy panel on the inner tent. It did look nice and 1,6 kg for a 2P tent is reasonable. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14697110576" title="NEMO Equipment Dagger 2P by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5581/14697110576_b2c26b1973_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="NEMO Equipment Dagger 2P" /></a></p>

<p>However, the Blaze 2P (that name reminds me of a club I used to go as a student =) is a 2P tent with a minimum weight of 910 g. That’s already a serious number for ultralighters. Add in that there’s two doors and also two vestibules and it’s much the same as the Dagger above, just lighter! It’s achieved by the pole construction - there’s one pole that goes corner-to-corner while a short pole on top creates a large interior living space. NEMO says they will be waterproof, durable and tear-resistant, so this really could be a interesting 2P tent to check out next year.</p>

<p>But NEMO Equipment also makes quilts and sleeping bags. The Tango Solo 30 (there’s a Tango Duo, too) is their new quilt. 810 g light, filled with 330 g DownTek treated 700 cuin down it has a comfort rating of -1°C. Interesting was the hood which you can slide under your pad and then connect the quilt to it via push buttons, this way the quilt stays in place and possibly drafts are minimized.</p>

<p>The Swiss brand <a href="http://www.exped.com/finland/">Exped</a> had a wide selection of new gear. The Summit Lite 15 is new for 2015 and is the small brother of the already available Summit Lite 25. The 15 weighs 290 g and the 25 310 g, both pack flat away in the lid in a minute. They’re made of Triple Ripstop Nylon and have Daisychains and once ice axe look, so are well suited to work as a summit pack. There’s even a stretch outside pocket!</p>

<p>The Thunder comes in a 50 and 70 l volume size, and does remind me a bit of past GoLite packs. These 1400 g or 1490 g respectively, three entries to the main compartment stretch mesh side and front pockets and side compressison straps which also can be used across the front. Maybe something for long backcountry trips where you carry a lot of food?</p>

<p>The Downmat TT is an expedition pad with interchangeable insulation tubes. It’s pretty versatile: You can adjust the width by leaving tubes out choose between down or synthetic tubes for the insulation you need for the trip in question. The regular length (184 cm) is 840 g and has an R-Value of 8. It has five years of warranty and the Octupus Inflation bag is included. You’ll pay 260€ for the M length.</p>

<p>Lighter and likely more interesting for the majority of readers here is the Winterlite pad. The 180 cm long pad is 495 g light and has the same R-Value as the Expedition TT: 8. It’s claimed to keep you insulated down to -38°C and has a small pack size, too. It comes with a nozzle pump sack which also works as the stuff sack and will start at 220€.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14533742847" title="Exped Winterlite by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3910/14533742847_7000b0ed9e_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Exped Winterlite" /></a></p>

<p>The Synmat Hyperlite is 330 g light in 180 cm length and has still an R-Value of 3.1. The pack size is pretty good too as you can see, and it will cost 150€.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14720185875" title="Exped Synmat Hyperlite by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3856/14720185875_9558534b17_b.jpg" width="1024" height="430" alt="Exped Synmat Hyperlite" /></a></p>

<p>Finally, SIM Hyperlite is a self-inflating pad that come sin three sizes. An R-Value of 3.2 keeps you warm till -5°C and with a weight of 370 g for the Torso length mat it’s still lightweight (the 183 cm long pad is 520 g). They’ll cost between 80 and 100€.</p>

<h2 id="nw-alpine">NW Alpine</h2>

<p><a href="http://nwalpine.com/">NW Alpine</a> hails from Portland, Oregon and is one of many innovative companies from that area. The Eyebright Jacket I’m wearing there is a breathable cuben fibre jacket that tips the scales at 140 g. It has a climbing-specific fit and will get some minor updates for the next season. Other new garments include a Polartec Alpha Hoody, Jacket and pants, a couple of normal pants, a new Men’s and Women’s WPB Jacket and several more garments - all made in Portland. </p>

<h2 id="vargo">Vargo</h2>

<p>On the shuttle bus from the Airport to Friedrichshafen I had the good luck to sit next to Brian <a href="http://www.vargooutdoors.com/">Vargo</a> and so we had a interesting discussion during the two hour ride to the fair grounds. During the weekend I then swung by to see the new gear he already had told me about on the bus, and it was good stuff. The Ti Flask with an integrated silicone funnel which fold down when not needed certainly was cool and I can see the use of this on long winter treks. Tasty Scottish whisky from a Ti flask? Yes please.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14683328433" title="Vargo by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3901/14683328433_8abe12d25a_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Vargo" /></a></p>

<p>The Ti running crampons should be around 60 g for one and fold up when not needed. Eight spikes under the front and middle foot give grip on ice and snow and are easy to take off/ put on. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14476803118" title="Vargo Ti Running crampons by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5512/14476803118_06276d920a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Vargo Ti Running crampons" /></a></p>

<p>The Titanium external Frame with cuben compartment is 940 g light. Certainly a product for a very limited audience but I totally can see a market for it. You can strap a bear canister to the bottom and generally lash gear to the frame. The frame was comfy to wear and is the same as in the <a href="http://www.vargooutdoors.com/ti-arc-backpack.html">Ti-Arc pack</a> which has a pack from another material. Packrafters, hunters and bushcrafters and people who head for long time into the wild are most likely to find this pack attractive. </p>

<p>And then there was <a href="http://www.vargooutdoors.com/apparel.html">Titanium apparel</a>. Sadly it doesn’t make you Iron Man or his Titanium Brother, but it claims it has some good benefits like staying non-smelly and dry. Tests will show if this will be the case, though it’s an interesting development. Every UL backpacker loves Titanium, and the idea to wear it just plain awesome. </p>
