    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have to agree with Craig Medred: Many of today’s cardboard-cutout adventurers only dream of adventure. Dick Griffith, on the other hand, has traversed unexplored canyons in a packraft and has skied solo across thousands of kilometres of the Arctic. All of it without sponsors. All vividly documented in his journals. And now for you and me to read about in this fine book.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14614504160" title="Canyons and Ice by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3847/14614504160_d1e910e7b4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Canyons and Ice" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Canyons and Ice: The Wilderness Travels of Dick Griffith</strong> is written by Kaylene Johnson and is based on the journals Dick and his wife Isabelle have written on their trips, while several of their contemporaries &amp; their children also have contributed to the book. It is very captivating, written in the third person and contains 17 of his adventures. If you’re by now wondering who that Dick Griffith is: The pioneer of packrafting who has done the first descend of the Barranca del Cobre canyon in Mexico (without topographic maps!), a 17 times participant of the Alaska Wilderness Classic and a man who has walked &amp; skied over 6000 miles (that’s over 9.650 km) across the Canadian and Alaskan Arctic. All of it paid out of his own pocket and not looking for recognition. Inspiring stuff.</p>

<p>The first story in the book takes place in 1946 and we accompany a 19 year old Dick on a walk in Colorado along the White River, which started out on a home-made wooden raft that sunk on the first day. But already two years later we stand with Dick at the shore of the San Juan River and accompany him on a rafting trip down it. The following five chapters contain stories from various river exploits and we learn how packrafts got used for the first time on large rivers &amp; in tight canyons. We meet Dick’s wife Isabelle, encounter Tarahumara Indians and make a few first descents down deep canyons over hard wild water.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14614508550" title="Canyons and Ice by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3869/14614508550_c48854e64e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Canyons and Ice" /></a></p>

<p>After so much water the stories turn north and we accompany Dick on his first Arctic skiing expedition. On which he almost dies - lets say frostbite on your buttocks and legs is no fun. The photos documenting this mishap I will remember for a long time, as well as the lesson that you always should have a windproof pants on when venturing in the cold Arctic and there’s a stiff breeze blowing. After a few operations we accompany Dick on several more Arctic expeditions, where we encounter ice bears, rabid foxes, hospitable locals who can’t believe to encounter a white-haired man skiing alone through the frozen north. The photos are pre-digital and fit the stories very well and depict the people Dick met and travelled with, as well as the landscapes he travelled through.</p>

<p>The untamed wilderness is what drove Dick to explore. Being with his own thoughts. Recharging the batteries. Much of the same reasons many of us go out. If you’re in need for a book to keep you entertained - and you will be, it’s a gripping book that’s hard to put down - before your next trip, you should read this book. You can get it at <a href="http://amzn.to/1zCEVMS">Amazon.com</a>, <a href="http://amzn.to/1zCF1US">Amazon.co.uk</a> or <a href="http://amzn.to/1zCFgix">Amazon.de</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Pack-Sail-Rafting is the next evolutionary step for packrafting. <a href="http://valppaus.com/">Joni</a> and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/m3t/sets/72157644771350449/">Marko</a> have been having fun packsailing (as it is also know) already since the spring and with Joni being currently in Pohjanmaa I took the opportunity to it try out when he asked me to join him on a packrafting trip in the Kvarken Archipelago.</p>

<p>Svedjehamn harbour is a 45 minute ride from Vaasa and was quickly picked as a starting point for our little Pack-Sail-Rafting trip. I’ve been here <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/kvarken-archipelago/">before</a> a few times, while it was the first time for Joni to be at this most distant point on the archipelago which can be reached by car. We paid for the parking ticket (2€ for 4h, though I doubt anyone checks) and headed off to the harbour. <a href="http://www.packrafting-store.de/">Packrafts</a> were inflated, gear stored, <a href="http://www.packrafting-store.de/Safety/Anfibio-Buoy-Boy::499.html">Anfibio Buoy Boy Vests</a> put on and then we boarded our vessels.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14600378168" title="Pack-Sail-Rafting by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3840/14600378168_0cd20936e6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Pack-Sail-Rafting" /></a>

<p>Joni had the <a href="http://www.windpaddle.com/cruiser_sail.htm">WindPaddle Cruiser Sail</a> attached to his Llama and we quickly saw that the <a href="http://www.packrafting-store.de/Safety/Anfibio-Throwbag::415.html">Anfibio Throwbag</a> is a great multi-use item as it worked well as a towing-rope. There were two White-tailed Eagles making their rounds above us while the wind transported us in no time across the water. We stopped at one of the rocks protruding from the sea - which is very shallow in the Archipelago - and attached the <a href="http://www.welhonpesa.fi/tuote/2301/windpaddle-scout-malli-yksikoille">WindPaddle Sail</a> to my Yak. I got some quick instructions on its use and then I was off.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14806861073" title="Pack-Sail-Rafting by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2935/14806861073_8888452ae9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Pack-Sail-Rafting" /></a></p>

<p>It was superb. I’ve never been that fast in my packraft without needing to do anything. Balancing the sail behind my head and keeping it in the wind while steering with the paddle I quickly reached the outer limits of the moraines that criss-cross the archipelago here. I stopped and waited for Joni, we had a look at the map &amp; clock to decide what to do next.</p>

<p>We switched the sail again to Joni’s Llama and took a bearing to the West, as much as the wind allowed. But as the wind did blow more to the north, Joni stashed the sail away after a while and we paddled onwards, west-wards. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14600497307" title="Pack-Sail-Rafting by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5580/14600497307_c7690fe772_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Pack-Sail-Rafting" /></a>

<p>We crossed loads of shallow bays where the water wasn’t much deeper than 50 cm - often less. But with packrafts this wasn’t much of a problem - if you got stuck on a rock you just pushed yourself loose with some momentum &amp; were free again. We paddled until we were in a dead end &amp; then had the option to paddle around the ridge or cross it. We decided for the latter - that’s after all the beauty of packrafting, that you can just land at shore, shoulder your raft and walk onwards. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/14600027980" title="Crossing of one of the ridges ended up as a muddy wade through a bed of reeds and what not, while being chased by a flight of hungry horse flies - part of the game :) by Joni Palomäki, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3881/14600027980_0567d7110c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Crossing of one of the ridges ended up as a muddy wade through a bed of reeds and what not, while being chased by a flight of hungry horse flies - part of the game :)" /></a>

<p>It was a short hike along the beach and through very high reed with a high amount of horse flies, so we were happy as we reached the water again and could continue paddling, leaving the biting insects behind as fast as possible. </p>

<p>We paddled between the moraines which made for nice, calm paddling. Just the final bit was in strong head wind, but thanks to the new design of the Alpacka packrafts which run so smooth and straight it wasn’t much of a problem. We arrived back in Svedjehamn after having paddled and sailed six kilometre which felt like just two - funny how distances on the water can be so deceiving. Back on terra firma we packed up as the sky was darkening and the thunderstorms which were forecast started to make themselves known. We packed the car, snapped some more photos and then were off back to Vaasa, where thick rain drops welcomed us. </p>

<p>It was a fun day out and a <a href="http://www.welhonpesa.fi/tuote/2301/windpaddle-scout-malli-yksikoille">WindPaddle Sail</a> is now high on my list. I’ve had it since last year on the radar as three Spaniards crossed Scotland by packraft with the WindPaddle Sails but dismissed it then, but trying one I think it’s an excellent way to efficiently travel by packraft - if the wind goes your way. Thanks Joni for letting me try it!</p>

<h2 id="packrafting-in-ruunaa">Packrafting in Ruunaa</h2>

<p>I was just back from the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/outdoor-fair-2013/">OutDoor Fair</a> when I saddled two packs with packrafts on my shoulders to travel to Ruunaa, where I was teaching a packrafting course. It was a very wet weekend, though we laughed, paddled and hiked a lot. One more packrafting aficionado joined the tribe, eagerly waiting to acquire his own, taking it on future adventures on rivers and lakes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9559715313/" title="Wet by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3799/9559715313_228cbc97ab_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Wet" /></a>

<h2 id="backpacking-in-seitseminen">Backpacking in Seitseminen</h2>

<p>Another course with three superb clients, we were backpacking for three days in the beautiful Seitseminen National Park and learned about ultralight skills and gear. Gathered mushrooms, swam in the lake, sat around the fire and slept warm in hammocks and quilts, while the sun shone down on our trail. </p>

<h2 id="kungsleden">Kungsleden</h2>

<p>A failed trip is also a trip. After the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/03/abisko-ice-climbing-festival-2013-experiences.html">Abisko Ice Climbing Festival</a> I had an ambitious plan to ski a loop on the Kundgsleden, though as I took a fall while ice climbing where I injured my knee the skiing was just too painful, and so I returned after having skied 20 km on brand-new skis which I would have loved to take up some fjells. Alas, it was not meant to be, though I will return soon enough for a re-match.</p>

<p>The largest amount of untold stories are the dozens of <a href="http://www.outdoors.fi/destinations/WorldHeritageSites/kvarkenarchipelago/activities/Pages/Default.aspx">dayhikes</a> and overnighters here in the region. Plenty of great outdoor destinations around Vaasa, not only the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/05/a-family-hike-on-the-bodvattnet-runt.html">Kvarken Archipelago</a> which it counts to explore - by bike, packraft, on foot, and soon again on skis and snowshoes.</p>
