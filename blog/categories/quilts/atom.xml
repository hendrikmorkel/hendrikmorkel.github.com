    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.enlightenedequipment.com/">enLIGHTened equipment</a> has been making quilts since 2008 and produces quilts which are warm, light, high-quality and affordable. For the past two summers, autumn and spring I have been sleeping under Revelation quilts - time enough for a <em>living review</em>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/13133227485/" title="enLIGHTened equipment by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3713/13133227485_b870623fb8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="437" alt="enLIGHTened equipment" /></a></p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>This really is a review about three <a href="http://www.enlightenedequipment.com/?product_cat=revelation">enLIGHTened equipment Revelation quilts</a>: The Revelation 40°F &amp; Revelation X 40°F from 2012 and Revelation 30°F from 2013. All quilts have spent a minimum of ten nights outside - on the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2012/09/ultralight-summit-daytrippin.html">UL Summit in Slovenia</a>, packrafting and backpacking trips and overnighters.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7783259222/" title="Open Doors by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8307/7783259222_fbc46ab400_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Open Doors" /></a></p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>The idea of a quilt is to give you flexibility and to save weight in comparison with a sleeping bag. In a sleeping bag the down underneath you is largely compressed and so can not loft as much. This means the down on which you lay is material and weight which isn’t performing 100% - thus just take it out to save money and weight. After all, you have a good <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/sleeping-mats/">mattress</a> to keep your back warm. The Revelation quilts can be used as a quilt with a closed footbox or as a flat blanket, depending on your needs. Its open baffle construction means you can move the down where you need it (usually to the top), and there are elastic straps which let you connect it to your mattress to eliminate drafts.</p>

<p><img style="max-width:100%" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7458/13140815315_8be5a98c5f_b.jpg#tl-500938784263634945;1043138249" /><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//cdn.thinglink.me/jse/embed.js"></script></p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>What’s great about the Revelation quilts is that you can order the quilt which suits your needs best and choose from</p>

<ul>
  <li>Three down sorts</li>
  <li>Six temperature ratings</li>
  <li>Four lengths</li>
  <li>Four widths</li>
  <li>Five inside colours</li>
  <li>Five outside colours</li>
  <li>Additional head and foot weather protection</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s seven options to play with to create the quilt of your dreams, with prices going from $160 for a summer quilt to $565 for a serious winter quilt. Features in my three quilts are the zippered foot box, an adjustable neck closure, dual-use as a hammock under-quilt and removable straps. All are regular length and width.</p>

<p><img style="max-width:100%" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3742/13133224325_e2185ae526_b.jpg#tl-500938784460767233;1043138249" /><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//cdn.thinglink.me/jse/embed.js"></script></p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>The open baffle construction of the Revelation Series probaly was a technical innovation (The Epiphany quilt was a major innovation in that it used cuben fibre as the shell and lining for the down!). enLIGHTened equipment is staying at the top of the innovation chain and is quickly adopting new technologies for their products, like the Downtek treated Goose down for their top-of-the-line quilts.</p>

<p>You also can see that enLIGHTened equipment is improving their designs every year. My two 2012 quilts e.g. have rubber bands to connect the quilt to the pad, while the 2013 version uses flat buckles through which you can pull flat webbing or elastic straps to connect quilt and pad. And now in 2014 enLIGHTened equipment is using an updated baffle system, new down, and added several more options and features to their quilts.</p>

<p><img style="max-width:100%" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2558/13133531584_78aa5903c9_b.jpg#tl-500938785559674881;1043138249" /><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//cdn.thinglink.me/jse/embed.js"></script></p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>The quality of the enLIGHTened equipment quilts is great. No lose threads, clean strap ends, the used material is very down-proof, well-running zippers, and the quoted weight is spot on which is a sign of great craftsmanship. While the Revelation X uses Ripstop Nylon seconds and is cheaper than the Revelation and a bit heavier, I could not find any errors in the fabric. If you’re on a budget then the Revelation X (nowadays comparable to the Revelation 750 although the 750 uses high-quality materials - no seconds - and a better baffle system) is a superb choice to try out quilts and see if they’re something for you. All quilts are made in Winona, MN, USA. </p>

<p><img style="max-width:100%" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2274/13133226885_3348f89b81_b.jpg#tl-500938784716619777;1043138249" /><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//cdn.thinglink.me/jse/embed.js"></script></p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<ul>
  <li>489 g for the Revelation X 40°</li>
  <li>389 g for the Revelation 40°</li>
  <li>497 g for the Revelation 30°</li>
  <li>17 g for the Silnylon stuff sack</li>
</ul>

<p>The weight difference between the Revelation X 40° and Revelation 40° is 100 g and due to the heavier shell and lining of the Revelation X. The Revelation 30° on the other hand is a warmer quilt, suitable for spring and autumn use, and the increase in weight is almost exclusively due to to more down being used.</p>

<p><img style="max-width:100%" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3751/13133360933_a40b7f9c5c_b.jpg#tl-500938784993443841;1043138249" /><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//cdn.thinglink.me/jse/embed.js"></script></p>

<h2 id="sustainability--recyclability">Sustainability &amp; Recyclability</h2>

<p>Down is a natural material that has a long life if you take well care of it - wash it regularly and a down quilt can last 20 years or longer. The shell and lining materials, while thin, have proven this far very durable and show no signs of use, even after dozens of nights spend outside and stuffed into compression sacks. There’s no a take-back scheme (yet) where you could return the quilt after many years of use, though you could just drop it in your local garment recycle bin and let them sort things out.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/13140821365/" title="Revelation X 40° by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3759/13140821365_177fbd61a9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Revelation X 40°" /></a></p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p>All three quilts have seen a lot of nights outside since they arrived - the enLIGHTened equipment quilts are a lot lighter than my <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2009/09/gear-talk-golite-ultra-20-initial-review.html">Golite Ultra 20°</a> and in my opinion just as warm (GoLite’s quilt is not a 20°F quilt, even if claimed to be!). I love the tiny pack size of the Revelation 40° - it packs very small and is excellent for fast and light trips where not just weight, but also volume matter.</p>

<p>With the open baffle structure it’s best if you just check already at home how to use it right. I moved the majority of down to the top in the torso area, and in that configuration the 40°F quilts where plenty warm for summer - often even to warm, but the beauty of a quilt is that you can easily get in and out of it. In the middle of summer where night temps will stay above 10°C I will use the quilt open, and just like a blanket as you’d at home. If it goes under 10°C I zip the footbox closed so my toes stay warm at night.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/13141103004/" title="Revelation 40° by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7299/13141103004_d8d8444ab4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Revelation 40°" /></a></p>

<p>The tapered design helps in saving weight and works well with modern mats which are also tapered. I usually do not connect the quilt to the pad and prefer to just drape it loosely over me, , tucking the sides under me - also because I move a lot in my sleep. It are warm quilts and I had the 40° Revelations down to 0°C without problems (in a bivy on a warm mat), while the Revelation 30°F is fine to around -5°C with a good mattress, a baselayer and in a bivy. If you’re going SUL you can use the quilt as a blanket/ coat at camp and wrap it around you, just snap the head piece around your neck and tighten the strap. You then can fold the footbox up and use the strap from the footbox to wrap it around your waist, which keeps arms, buttocks and back warm with the option of wrapping the quilt further closed in the front for a very cozy “jacket”. </p>

<p>Nowadays enLIGHTened equipment quilts can get a head and foot weather protection, which is a DWR treated shell fabric which minimizes the possibility of the down getting wet from your breath at night or condensation that’s on the inside wall of your shelter, against which the footbox might rub. My quilts don’t have that extra, though I think it’s a smart addition, especially if you do not use a bivy to protect the quilt. I sometimes had a bit of moisture at the head end in the mornings but hanging the quilt in the sun to dry for a bit had it dry in no time (that’s why you always should choose one side black!).</p>

<p>My Revelation quilts both have a 10D fabric on the inside and outside - the lightest option. If you hold the quilts into the sun you can see the down through it, and while a very light material it has shown it can take weeks on end of sleeping under, stuffing into a compression bag and being hanged from trees and fences to dry without getting damaged. It’s a good, lightweight material for summer and autumn bags, and likely will be just as good for a winter bag. </p>

<p>The quilts pack very small and loft quickly at camp - shake it a few times, then move the down where you want it and <em>Voilá!</em> you can tuck in. Packing is just as fast - just stuff it in the bag and you’re done.</p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>I have been very satisfied with the Revelation quilts from enLIGHTened equipment. They’re very well made, light, functional and pack small for the trail. They loft quickly and I can adjust the down to my needs - evenly spread on warm nights or on top if it is a bit colder. They’re very affordable for such a high-quality product, and given that you can chose from seven options it’s possible for you to design the quilt which suits your needs perfectly. While there are a couple other quilt makers the enLIGHTened equipment Revelation quilts have probably the best quality-to-price ratio of all, and hence are ideal for those that want to give quilts a try or need a 2nd quilt as you’re unlikely to get such a good quilt for such a good price. </p>

    <link href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2009/09/gear-talk-golite-ultra-20-initial-review.html"/>
    <updated>2009-09-25T00:00:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://hikinginfinland.com/2009/09/gear-talk-golite-ultra-20-initial-review</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few readers have been asking me about the <a href="http://www.golite.com/Product/ProdDetail.aspx?p=SS7500&amp;mc=181&amp;t=&amp;lat=">GoLite Ultra 20° quilt</a> and how I like it, and I told them I would like to sleep a few more nights under it before I write an initial review. I slept a few more nights under it, and am now ready to let you know my first impressions.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/MPouWwXrfqbVxUW1cJbeAQ?authkey=Gv1sRgCP3AxonxzYCB3QE&amp;feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/SrzjOZ7lqcI/AAAAAAAAAio/Uv1RijkwRjA/s800/IMG_1921.JPG" /></a><br />Ready for sleeping!<br /><br />Lets start off with the important bits and pieces, which UL backpackers find interesting. My GoLite Ultra 20°, which is 175 cm long, weights 561 g including its packsack. Its filled with 270 g of 800-fill goose down, the turquoise outer is made of a very thin yet durable and down proof material, and in the grey foot and head area GoLite used Pertex Endurance, which is a waterproof material. The inside is very soft and feels comfortable on the skin - the outer as well.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/ahs4KKse-8nq0nC2kfvx-A?authkey=Gv1sRgCP3AxonxzYCB3QE&amp;feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/SrzizXJNF3I/AAAAAAAAAic/aEWMqQnmc1g/s800/IMG_2006.JPG" /></a><br />The turquoise outer.<br /><br />There were two bands which are supposed to go under the mattress, but I found this not practical and just took them off, and stuff the sides under my back when I go to sleep, that arrangement lets no warmth escape. Totally at the top there’s a button, so you can close the collar around your neck and with the draw cord you can zip it tight - a smart system which functions very well for me. The quilt has a footbox, which means your feet are completely surrounded by down and will be toasty. Its a smart idea, because it adds a bit more insulation to the bottom, considering that the majority of UL backpackers sleep on a torso sized mattress. It also fixates the quilt. Finally, I got a bit extra space in the foot box, so I can dry stuff there or keep batteries and other equipment warm.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/8avpx5pcXC2M98pW4n8y4A?authkey=Gv1sRgCP3AxonxzYCB3QE&amp;feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/SrzjA8SjWMI/AAAAAAAAAik/q7MSLP8xRC0/s800/IMG_2027.JPG" /></a><br />Button and draw cord = trapping all warmth inside. <br /><br />Speaking of a mattress, I have been sleeping on a small  <a href="http://cascadedesigns.com/therm-a-rest/mattresses/fast-and-light/neoair/product">NeoAir</a> with my Ultra 20° and found it a very fine combo. The NeoAir did reach it limits on colder nights, though, so I’ll combine it with a <a href="http://cascadedesigns.com/therm-a-rest/mattresses/fast-and-light/z-lite/product">Z Lite</a> for the next nights. The solution I used without the Z Lite  with me was to put my <a href="http://www.rab.uk.com/clothing/shell/new_momentum_jacket---131/">Rab Momentum Jacket</a> with the outside down under me. That worked excellently, and kept me also from underneath very warm. Multipurpose all the way!<br /><br />Lets talk about pack size. The Ultra 20° packs very small, as you can see from the photo. That’s for me a huge plus, because I do not like a big pack size (I’m looking at you, dear winter sleeping bag of colossal proportions). The packsack itself is waterproof to some extent, it leaks in at the seam so if you don’t use a packliner or similar I recommend using a waterproof packsack for it. Forgot to weigh the packsack and am currently not at home, so let me guesstimate its weight at ~10 g.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/7aBrybKFj-Sl5w1J-16piQ?authkey=Gv1sRgCP3AxonxzYCB3QE&amp;feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/Srzi68jKlkI/AAAAAAAAAig/ZXz_bldArmQ/s800/IMG_2007.JPG" /></a><br />Small, isn’t it?<br /><br />The Ultra 20° is supposed to keep one warm till about -7°C (or 20° Fahrenheit). I haven’t yet experienced that low temperatures, given that it is September and we have night temperatures of about 5°C. Until those temperatures I was toasty warm, and could have done without the merino base layer I was wearing. I’m going to sleep under it tonight, and temps might drop to around 0°C (I’m a bit further up north and at the coast for the next few days), so I’ll see how it goes and let you know tomorrow.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/W8WNXkHYSlw3eGyt_gDP2Q?authkey=Gv1sRgCP3AxonxzYCB3QE&amp;feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/SrzjoOqgFUI/AAAAAAAAAis/_sQVV0jW-_w/s800/IMG_1937.JPG" /></a><br />The bed is made for tonight!<br /><br />So, what do I think? I had a few nights with quite a bit of condensation in the Scarp 1, and in the morning the areas with Pertex Endurance where nice and dry, but the turquoise material was wet and the down under it sticked to the outer material. Nothing that a while in the sun can’t fix, though I think a complete shell outer of Pertex Endurance would be nice - this might make it more heavier, though. That’s the only thing I can think of which could be improved. I’m really satisfied with the quilt so far, it doesn’t lose down, it has plenty of space for movement, its warm and very practical in regards to weight and pack size. For people who are considering the switch from sleeping bag to quilt, the Ultra 20° is the perfect quilt as it is both high quality and affordable - 180€ including shipping from <a href="http://www.ultralightoutdoorgear.co.uk/golite_ultra_20_-_unisex_backless_down_sleeping_bag.html">Ultralight Outdoor Gear</a> is a very good price, much cheaper then other high quality UL quilts. I’m actually already thinking how I can make the Ultra 20° useable in deep Winter, because I like it so much!</p>
