    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Högakustenleden - or High Coast Trail in English - is a new trail that passes through the UNESCO World Heritage site of the same name. The scenic trail passes through villages &amp; towns, along the coast, through the forest and a beautiful National Park and if you have a free week makes for a great walk along the Swedish coastal hills.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16034082038" title="Jon Nils Berget is the highest point on the trail by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7571/16034082038_6e226a048a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Jon Nils Berget is the highest point on the trail" /></a></p>

<p>November marks usually the last month of the year where I go out on a Press Trip to do research for <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/magazines/">magazine</a> articles. It’s far from the perfect backpacking month in the North and I had planned to hike the High Coast Trail in August, but changes in schedules meant it’d be the final backpacking trip of the year. Happily my good friend Martin agreed to accompany me, and so we met up late on a Sunday night in a <a href="http://umea.kfum.se">Hostel in Umeå</a>, him after flying in, me after taking the <a href="http://www.wasaline.com">ferry from Vaasa</a>. The next morning we enjoyed the breakfast at the Hostel and walked to the bus station from where we had a comfortable and fast bus ride to the bus stop at Hornöberget just before the High Coast Bridge, the start point of the trail. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16221689035" title="Start at the High Coast Bridge in Hornöberget by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7551/16221689035_e5fb4a7ab7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Start at the High Coast Bridge in Hornöberget" /></a></p>

<p>We followed the street for a bit, took to a forest road and soon saw our first Högakustenleden trail marker and were on a proper trail. It was a short one, though, because the next several kilometres took us along on village roads, along the street, across bridges until we finally walked along the Baltic Sea and came upon a proper trail into the forest. It wasn’t all pleasurable forest trails, though, we also passed a few deforested areas until we finally reached Sör-Lövvik, the end of section 1. The <a href="http://lovvikbedandbreakfast.se">Lövvik B&amp;B</a> looked inviting just along the trail, and while it was still early in the day we somehow wouldn’t have minded to stop there or at the free cottage in the village, but as it was closed for the winter we just continued until Fjärdbotten.</p>

<p>We hiked for a while along the road and then took a turn onto a forest path. We found a stream to refill our water bottles and continued until the Laavu at Halsviken Bay. The place looked nice, and with dusk upon us we yet again were tempted to put the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/09/hyperlite-mountain-gear-ultamid.html">HMG UltaMid</a> up for the night. We resisted the early finish and continued on the trail, which then went through a boulder field along the shore. Sleet from the sky, strong winds and spray from the sea make walking on boulders a pleasurable past time, which only can be improved by onsetting darkness. We somehow managed to no break any feet or legs and were rather happy as we reached the forest road and road to Fjärdbotten. It was dark and raining as we arrived there, not knowing what to expect. </p>

<p>Fjärdbotten was a great camping place. Around six wooden cottages with tables, benches, beds and some with a stove in them were too good a chance to pass up. Martin quickly put a clothes line up, we hang our wet gear up to dry, got a fire started and then the <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/primus-eta-lite-gaskocher/">Primus Lite+</a> came out and boiled us hot water for dinners and Minttu Kakaos! Well fed we soon dived into our sleeping bags and had a good night’s sleep. </p>

<p>The next morning was drizzly but looked like it might clear up. After we explored the Fjärdbotten summer farm and checked out the other cottages and got water from the well we had a warm breakfast &amp; coffee, boiled water for our <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2012/11/thermos-bottle.html">Thermos</a> and then soon were out on the trail again. The decision to stay at Fjärdbotten was a good one, and it was a very nice place.</p>

<p>The next section took us on the highest point along the trail, Jon Nils Berget. We were lucky as the drizzle from the morning stopped after a few kilometres of hiking and we were treated by one of those fine, sunny days which you get after a night of rain. The trail was a mix of nice forest roads (they’re great to walk and talk on with a party of two!) where abandoned caravans were every few kilometres. As we reached Jon Nils Berget the sun came out and we really enjoyed this beautiful moment. </p>

<p>We had a quick tea and cookies break at the Nipstugan on Lidenipan, and the sun just continued to treat us with warmth and light on the way to Gavik, the end of the 3rd Section. Behind Gavik we hiked on a forest road along summer cottages which had been closed up for winter, and had a very late lunch as the sun was just setting somewhere in the West. Soon the headlamps came on as we hiked on dark and wet forest trails and snowy forest roads.</p>

<p>The goal of Section 4 was Lappuden, which was hailed as <em>the</em> camping spot along the Högakustenleden. Well, it was not. As it was closed. Closed up for winter. After the luxury of the Fjärdbotten hut we were going to sleep outside, and as the lake and grass fields already were covered with thin ice we knew we’d be in for a cold night. Alas, not even a fire we were able to lighten up, for a lack of wood and a fire place. We still had a good night, even if my <a href="http://www.phdesigns.co.uk">PHD Minix Sleeping Bag</a> was a tad too less insulation for these temperatures. The next morning the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/10/garmin-fenix.html">fēnix</a> said -3°C and we packed up while the Lite+ boiled water for breakfast &amp; coffee. We were early on the trail again, and we were happy to leave the disappointment of Lappuden behind.</p>

<p>The trail was again a mix of enjoyable forest trails, OK forest roads and less enjoyable asphalt streets, but happily the trails made up the majority os Section 5 to Ullånger. The highlight for Martin and me was the beautiful Erikskojan hut high up in the middle of the forest. It stood lonely there, and if I hadn’t pulled like someone who really wants to sit inside with his tea we probably would have drunk our hot tea on its steps as the door was very tightly closed =) Of all the huts we passed this was the one we both really would have loved to stay in for the night, as it was cozy and comfortable. Alas, we needed to continue onwards.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16195558186" title="Lovely deforestation views by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7568/16195558186_41f1ab48d3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Lovely deforestation views" /></a></p>

<p>As we hiked into Ullånger it was still lunch time, and we didn’t need long to decide on the Värdshuset Restaurang Snäckan to get our business. A Lunch Buffet is a Hiker’s dream, and tasty Swedish food was consumed in large amounts, topped off with coffee and cookies. It was fortunate that we didn’t need to hike a long distance to our next camping place, the Gårdberget Stugan just above Ullånger. We didn’t really know what to expect, but were delighted by the hut, which was decorated in a 70s style and had a big stove inside. A fire was roaring quickly while night fell, and we enjoyed the evening by talking and drinking a good Whisky.</p>

<p>The night over a powdery coat of snow covered the land and we enjoyed the walk in the morning through the silent forest. That silence was interrupted the closer we got to Sjöland and Skoved as the trail went along the highway. It was an interesting experience to hike with trucks and cars passing by at high speeds, and I do hope that the trail finds a different route in the future.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16262738312" title="Church door by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7555/16262738312_90e05236cb_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Church door" /></a>

<p>We flew through Section 7 from Skoved to Skuleberget and the <a href="http://www.naturumhogakusten.se/">Naturum Höga Kusten</a> Centre. Sadly the Museum also was closed, and as we still had well over 15 km before us we also didn’t take the detour over the top of the Skuleberget. The hill was impressive, though, and it’s nice to see that local entrepreneurs have installed Via Ferratas on it. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15643755233" title="Naturum Höga Kusten by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7561/15643755233_c0fd06d8dd_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Naturum Höga Kusten" /></a>

<p>Section 8 from Skuleberget to the Skuleberget National Park South Entry must have been one of the most frustrating ones on the trail. After the Naturum Höga Kusten Centre we had another quick lunch break outside and then followed the nice Kids Adventure/ Robber Trail, passed an Open Air Theatre and then crossed the highway once more to hike on trails and forest roads to the South Entry of the National Park. Some sections of the trail were flooded and it was impossible to keep your feet dry, which usually doesn’t bother me at all, but somehow that day it really annoyed me a lot. The trail wasn’t fun in the wet dirt &amp; mud, but happily I recovered as soon as the trail became dry again. As we came closer and closer to the Skuleberget National Park the better our moods got, and the view from the South Entry was indeed well worth coming there.</p>

<p>As frustrating as that wet part of the trail previously was, so wonderful was the <a href="http://www.sverigesnationalparker.se/skuleskogen#.VLUOe8bJhJc">Skuleskogen National Park</a>. The National Park probably was the highlight of our trip, and we were a bit sad that we spend only such a short time in day light in it. We hiked on duck boards for kilometres, passed waterfalls and then hiked up to the impressive Slåttdalsskrevan, a 200 m long, 40 m deep and 7 m wide crevice. We explored it in the shine of our headlamps and then made us on the way down to the Tärnättvattnen Stuga in the middle of the National Park. </p>

<p>The hut was gorgeous from the inside and outside, though as it often happens with such huts, they seem to accumulate rubbish and trinkets which previous visitors <em>left for others to enjoy</em> or simply <em>forgot</em>. We cleaned up, got a fire started and enjoyed the evening with the a <em>Feierabendbier</em> which we carried all the way from the Supermarket in Docksta till here to enjoy in this rustic hut. The next morning grey clouds still hung thickly in the sky and the sun wasn’t to be seen. We brought some more wood for the next visitors to the hut, cleaned up and packed and where on our way again.</p>

<p>The way out of the National Park was again very beautiful, along frozen lakes, via Duckboards over swamps, over small streams and soft forest trails until the North Entry.</p>

<p>It was noon as we arrived in Köpmanholmen, and as every good tourist hiker does we immediately located the local Pizzeria and ordered their lunch Pizza. 60 SEK for a Pizza, salad, drink and coffee is a real bargain, especially considering that the Pizzas were about 40 cm (!) in diameter. We were stuffed as we walked out of the village and walked on a sandy road until the where we would enter the Balesudden Nature Reserve. It was a very beautiful reserve and not even a kilometre from the start of the forest trail we passed the prettiest Laavu on the whole Högakustenleden, up on the hill overlooking the Baltic Sea. Again we regretted that we needed to push on and couldn’t stay here, as the view and atmosphere was gorgeous.</p>

<p>Instead we pushed on through on and up through the Balesudden Nature Reserve, though with dusk coming upon us and a light drizzle we had our eyes mostly on the slippery trail in front of us. We passed a nice fireplace and camping spot near a bay until we happened upon the Bodviken Stugan, our hut for the night. The drizzle had become rain and I was happy as Martin offered to go chop the wood. I started the fire and rolled out my sleeping bag and <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/therm-a-rest-neoair-xlite.html">mattress</a> and again fired up the Primus Lite+. Soon we were well fed and had a whisky in our cups, which ensured we had another good, relaxed and warm night.</p>

<p>In winter you can sleep long and still catch the sunrise. So after we had breakfast I took a little stroll around the hut to photograph the sunrise. It was just a brief moment where one could spot the sun, as it passed up from the sea to hide again behind the clouds. It was our last day on the trail, and we only had 21 km till Örnsköldsvik, with the last part in civilization, so that we took it easy. We passed a few more Laavus in the morning, hiked on forest roads and streets, up hills and had a quick break in the Småtjärnstugan, and then were very quickly in Svedje, the end of Section 12. </p>

<p>From here we passed through the town and climbed the local recreation area. As it was windy, 0°C and grey we just marched on towards Örnsköldsvik, the end of Section 13 of the Högakustenleden. Early in the afternoon we reached town. Done.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16076823010" title="Örnskoldvik by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7566/16076823010_6ce886089b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Örnskoldvik" /></a>

<p>While standing on the square in the centre a young Swede came talking to us, who recognized me as <em>the writer of Hiking in Finland</em>. It was a fun coincidence as he said he saw that we’d be hiking the trail that week and he met us just as we finished! Very cool! After inquiring about a good place to eat in the evening we walked to our hostel, <a href="http://www.vindarnashus.se">Vindarnas Hus</a>. It was a nice &amp; quiet hostel with Wifi, hot showers and good beds, and we chilled there in the evening until we headed out to eat at <a href="http://www.bishopsarms.com/Ornskoldsvik">The Bishops Arms</a> which not only had superb food but also impeccable service and great beers. It was a worthy finish to a great Högakustenleden thru-hike!</p>

<p>The funniest thing about the Högakustenleden was for Martin and me how the distances were way off from what the signs and the guide booklet said. It makes me wonder if the trail is actually hiked by the people who planned it and if they made the effort to check the distance, or if these were just made via some mapping tool. Because the Högakustenleden is supposed to be 128,6 km from Hornöberget to Örnsköldsvik, but I tracked with my <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/10/garmin-fenix.html">Garmin fēnix</a> 141,8 km in the six days we hiked it. This isn’t uncommon and I regularly hike trails and sections which are longer/ shorter than they’re claimed to be, but still is something to keep in mind when you plan to hike the trail. </p>

<p>Also important to know is that the trail goes quite a bit along forest roads and streets. It does feel like at least 50% of the trail makes use of such infrastructure, and while it can make for fast hiking (5 km an hour and easy to chat while walking next to each other) it isn’t really very inspiring. Happily there are enough of nice forest trails, too, and the section through the Skuleskogen National Park was gorgeous. If you have time I’d recommend planning a day to just explore the National Park and then hike on.</p>

<p>Plan the travel there and back via <a href="http://reseplanerare.resrobot.se/bin/help.exe/sn?L=vs_resrobot&amp;tpl=webapp">Resrobot</a>, one of the best travel apps I have used. It helps you to find the best Bus/ Train/ Flight connections from e.g. Stockholm to Hornöberget and Örnsköldsvik and also lets you book the tickets right away. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.visitsweden.com/sweden/">Visit Sweden</a> and the <a href="http://www.hogakustenleden.com">Högakustenleden</a> + <a href="http://hogakusten.com/en/hk/high-coast-trail.html">High Coast Trail</a> websites offer a host of information about Sweden and the trail, especially the last page has a great overview map and a description of each section. You can order from there also the useful <a href="http://hogakusten.com/information/en/brochures.html">Trail Guide</a>, though don’t bother with the (free) map as it’s too large a scale to be useful for hiking. Speaking of maps, you really can hike it just with the maps in the Trail Guide. The trail is exceptionally well marked and so very beginner-friendly, sometimes every third tree has an orange dot or stripe. </p>

<p>We slept every night in one of the free huts or Laavus and were completely alone on the trail, we once encountered day hikers. But then we were hiking in November, so in the spring, summer and autumn that could look very differently. I recommend you take a <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/gear-reviews/">shelter</a> along when hiking in those months, or make use of the various accommodation options along the trail. Basic ultralight gear choices would suit the trail well, you can practice pitching tarps and sleeping with a quilt here very well as you could always head to one of the Laavus or Huts. From Ullånger on you almost daily would pass a village with a supermarket, Café and Restaurant, so you could easily resupply along the trail (or buy a Swedish Beer for the evening each day =).</p>

<p>Along the trail you also could easily go packrafting, sea kayaking, climbing and Via Ferrata. While you could do some of these activities just besides the trail you’d need to plan an extra day for some others. Because of the good infrastructure (huts &amp; Laavus, Restaurants and Shops along the way) the trail could be a good choice for families who want to try backpacking with their kids. </p>

    <id>http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/abisko-ice-climbing-festival-2014</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s a long, boring ride from Vaasa to Abisko: 1.000 km of asphalt, past dozens of speed traps, trees, lakes and the Gulf of Botnia. Just the last hour, from Kiruna onwards, is interesting, and gets you in the mood for mountains, ice climbing, and making new friends at the northern-most ice climbing festival of the world.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/13083811733/" title="Road to Abisko by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7443/13083811733_5834be0283_b.jpg" width="1024" height="541" alt="Road to Abisko" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Vaasa, Wednesday afternoon, grey sky, +1°C</strong>. An academic quarter means being 15 minutes late. As Andreas is a student, it was thus just normal that he adhered to the academic quarter when he picked me up on Wednesday afternoon. Packs were loaded in the trunk, seats adjusted, and then we were the kings of the road. Before us lay roughly 600 km of riding till Rovaniemi. Even with good company, music and the roads in good conditions the ride to the gateway to Lapland takes so much time, that we were happy when we arrived past eleven in Rollo. A quick beer with our host Chris and it was off to bed.</p>

<p><strong>Rovaniemi, Thursday morning, grey sky, 0°C</strong>. As I silently get up at seven the next morning Chris, our host, is already up. <em>Coffee?</em>. Sure. We drink and talk at his kitchen table and lament the lack of good winter this year. <em>In the past everything was better</em>, that is how it must sound to people a generation younger than us. Andreas and me pack up our stuff and drive to Prisma, where we meet the third Musketeer for this journey: <a href="https://twitter.com/aleksimehtonen">Aleksi</a>. A few last groceries are purchased, another coffee is drunk, and we commence to the car. The ride out of Rovaniemi and into the north is as spectacular as leaving any other city, and the grey weather does not help to improve this feeling. It’s an hour drive to Pello where we cross into Sweden.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/13083701395/" title="Road by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7375/13083701395_b598697d56_b.jpg" width="1024" height="540" alt="Road" /></a></p>

<p>I gotta hand it to the Swedes, they at least know how to make the journey more interesting. The road from Pello onwards is going almost constantly along a wide river, which in the summer would be a superb packrafting adventure. Now, it at least makes for a slightly more interesting sight. In the middle of nowhere we stop and eat one of the best pea soups ever, and a set of pancakes to satisfy the sweet tooth. Another cup of dark coffee, and we’re on the road again. We pass Kiruna, the mining town that will be moved completely in the next twenty years, and steering the car north we can see the fjells of Sweden. The sun is breaking through in the distance, immersing the distant hills in a spectral light. The closer we come to our destination, the higher the fjells become, and from the road we already see many beautiful lines of ice going up.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/13083826363/" title="Abisko Canyon by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3729/13083826363_d93a660b6a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Abisko Canyon" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Abisko Canyon, Thursday afternoon, grey sky, -2°C</strong>. Merja from the <a href="http://www.arcticguides.com/">Arctic Guides</a> welcomes us to the festival, hands out Festival Passes and lets us know where to find everything. We bring our gear to the Nuolja Ski Hut, where we will be staying that night, dress up in our ice climbing clothes and head down to the canyon. On the way down I meet <a href="http://www.said-belhaj.com/">Said Belhaj</a> and we chat a bit. Down in the canyon, where already a few participants are whacking ice, Said asks if I’d like to belay him. <em>Sure</em>. Even if Said is more at home on the 8b routes of the world, he does climb ice just as well. It’s a good example that a good rock climber should have no problems translating his skills to ice. This becomes even more evident when Said tackles the vertical mixed route, which he climbs without problems with crampons and ice axes being natural extensions of his body.</p>

<p><strong>Abisko STF Mountain Station, Friday morning, blue sky, -2°C</strong>. I open the curtains in our room and can’t believe that the weather forecast is wrong. Nuolja stands against a blue sky, and the first rays of sun are touching its top. The breakfast buffet at the <a href="http://www.svenskaturistforeningen.se/en/Discover-Sweden/Facilities-and-activities/Lappland/Fjallstationer/STF-Mountain-station-Abisko/">Abisko STF Mountain Station</a> is worth a visit alone, and after a healthy dose of rye bread, bacon, cheese and scrambled eggs our small group packs our lunches and head out to the cars, which bring us to the first clinic, <em>Efficient multi pitch climbing on ice</em>. <a href="http://www.vertikalguiden.se/concrete/">Stefan</a> and <a href="http://www.arcticguides.com/">Martin</a> show us how it’s done, answer our questions, and then let us lose on the ice.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/13083702325/" title="Efficient Multipitch clinic tryouts by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2525/13083702325_e117c2ba98_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Efficient Multipitch clinic tryouts" /></a></p>

<p>I tie in with Jon, who works at the mines in Kiruna and came up to Abisko for the day. We take turns on the low ice walls establishing belays, belaying the second, and then climbing onwards. After several tries we feel we are ready to tackle on of the larger walls, but first we refuel with hot coffee, sandwiches and chocolate. In between sips of steaming coffee we chat, revealing and hearing more bout our climbing partner. It’s a reoccuring thing on these happenings, and I probably told <em>“My Story”</em> a dozen times over the weekend, and have heard just as many different interesting stories in return. It’s fascinating and the beauty of this happening, which brings people with a common interest to a magnificent place and lets them tie in and whack ice together.</p>

<p>Now knowing more about each other, Jon and I give a higher wall a try. I try to go first, but half-way between our supposed belay spot and the ground confidence leaves and I climb back down. Jon takes the lead, establishes a belay and I climb up. While it feels like we’re climbing the Mont Blanc du Tacul route we’re hanging a mere five meters above the ground, and energy leaves. While I’d now feel confident to go for the top, Jon suggests we take a break and then continue. I rappel down, Jon follows, another bread &amp; cuppa and we are back. This time Jon climbs the whole line and belays me from the top, while I clean the route. We high five on top of the cliff, and realize that we’re the last ones here. Anna waits with the shuttle bus at the road and smiles to us - <em>“Take your time!”</em>. We walk off the cliff, pack up, and ride back to the station. Beer time. Sauna time. Dinner time. Presentation time. Northern Lights. Sleeping time.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/13084146604/" title="Aurora Borealis by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3758/13084146604_f3c1d7042d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Aurora Borealis" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Abisko STF Mountain Station, Saturday morning, blue sky, -3°C</strong>. With the heating up in our cozy room it was too hot for me. Aleksi and me head together with Torbjörn &amp; Robert from Sweden up to the breakfast buffet. The talk goes to past adventures and future plans, but today we look forward to building abalakov and different belay stations before heading up to Nuolja. At <em>Kurva</em> Stefan teaches us again, and I’m glad we have such experienced and friendly instructors here at the Festival, who are happy to loan you their personal gear and answer your questions, even if they’ve answered the same thing already five times that day. We build different belays, which even at 20 cm above the ground gets the sweat flowing - especially if you forget to take off your down jacket. Building an abalakov is always exciting, and I’m happy as mine works on the first try. Then things go fast.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/13083875035/" title="Abalakov clinic by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7428/13083875035_9797ee2d6c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Abalakov clinic" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Nuolja, Saturday afternoon, blue sky, -2°C</strong>. The hike up to Nuolja is more strenous as expected, and 40 minutes later our little group stands below the cliff. While some set off to lead, others are waiting for the top rope to be set up. And while I’d feel confident enough to climb one of those WI3 slabs, all the lines are taken. Done with setting up the TR Stefan comes down and inquires what I’d like to do. <em>A lead climb would be nice</em> I reply. <em>Lets go and see the fall to the right</em>. Stefan, Andreas and me walk on the 50° hard snow to the base of the climb, and standing in front of it I see that this is closer to WI4, even if it’s relatively short with just 20 meters. <em>You lead, we second?</em> I suggest. <em>OK</em>. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/13083804033/" title="Nuolja by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2147/13083804033_036382b0f1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="408" alt="Nuolja" /></a></p>

<p>It’s a proper alpine adventure route, with lots and lots of snow, and topping out on top felt great. I walk a tad further up and coil my rope while Andreas climbs up. The helicopter which flew the other group to Kaisepakte flys by and snaps photos of us on top, and with Andreas on top we stroll to the rappel anker. As we wait for our turn to rappel down Torbjörn just tops out on his first lead climb, exhilarated about the achievement. On the way down I see Robert make the final moves to the top, and am happy for the two to have succeed on their first lead route.</p>

<p><strong>Abisko STF Mountain Station, Saturday evening, clear sky, -4°C</strong>. Hiking back to the road, Sara just pulls up to the parking lot as I arrive. We catch up while the others slowly come down from the mountain, and then we head back to the STF Mountain Station, where the Drytooling Competition is just about to start. Stefan, David and the Arctic Guide Team have built a sweet rig for us to compete on. Hang from the wooden block without touching the ground - the rules are simple, but even in the qualifying round some already fail. It’s the next round, with the wooden block moved further away, that sees only five succeed, and so the final is a thrilling event, and at the end we have one winner. After a quick shower and changing clothes the Festival Dinner starts. We’re treated to a three course meal which lets us taste some Swedish delicacies, which are accompanied by glasses of wine and beer. The mood is cheerful, everyone had a great day and got some good climbing in, and slowly we stroll to the After Lounge Bar, where Said treats us to a presentation about his 20 years as a climber. It’s a great story, filled with places and names which will demand the attention of any climber, communicated in Said’s friendly, down-to-earth way. Accompanied by good tunes we travel the globe from one great climbing destination to the next, and after Said plays the Digeridoo to finish off a long applause commences. On the way to the ski hut, more Northern Lights dance across the fjells and the lake, while the stars glow in the dark firmament.</p>

<p><strong>Abisko Canyon, Sunday morning, clear sky, -2°C</strong>. Also on the third day the Breakfast Buffet offers new tastes to explore, though the favouries of bacon, eggs and cheese on dark rye bread couldn’t be missed. We descent to the Abisko Canyon, where a clinic of Traditional Scottish Mixed is on the schedule. Stefan, who has over 20 years of experience of climbing mixed - often in underground caves in central Sweden - shows our little group the ins and outs, before we eagerly tie in the Top Ropes to try climbing with our tools and crampon on the rocks. The fun ends just too quickly, as I head back up to the sun to interview Anders for an article I’m writing for the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/trekking-magazin/">trekking Magazin</a>. Slowly also Aleksi and Andreas come up to the sun, after having enjoyed more Mixed &amp; Ice climbing, and we pack up the last bit of our gear to bring it to the car. It’s noon and the sun shines down on Lapporten, the gate to the Kungsleden, as we say our good byes to new and old friends. Another long ride is in front of us, but we’re certain we will return to the friends and ice of Abisko in the future.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In three weeks the second <a href="http://www.arcticguides.com/events">Abisko Ice Climbing Festival</a> kicks off, and it’s set to be pretty amazing again. In case you’re still on the edge about going - I will give you plenty of good reasons to travel to the northern most Ice Climbing Festival!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8553149630/" title="Lapporten ice climbing"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8380/8553149630_34b8f7fee8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Lapporten" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/03/abisko-ice-climbing-festival-2013-experiences.html">Last year’s AICF</a> was fantastic and I learned a lot. It’s not every day that you can pick the brains of Alpinists like Robert Jasper and the guys from Petzl, so as the 2nd AICF was announced, with a pretty fantastic line-up of instructors and clinics, it was an easy decision to travel north to Abisko this year again.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8553049416/" title="Canyon by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8086/8553049416_5a073d5199_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Canyon" /></a></p>

<p>Like last year, the AICF is something for everyone: From the complete novice who has never climbed ice to advanced climbers, who want to hone their skills. You can loan all the ice climbing gear, and will be very well instructed on its use and technique. Accommodation is in the very nice <a href="http://www.svenskaturistforeningen.se/upptack/Omraden/Lappland/Fjallstationer/STF-Abisko-Turiststation/">STF Turiststation Abisko</a>, and if you travel with the family: There’s plenty to do there for kids and partners, from sledging and snowshoe walks to skiing and watching Aurora Borealis.</p>

<p>For the climbing, this year’s clinics include <em>Traditional Scottish mix lead</em>, <em>Efficient multi pitch</em>, <em>Basic Ice/Mix</em> as well as <em>Efficient and safe belay</em> and <em>Ice strength/ belay/ rappel/ abalakov</em>. There’s going to be a competition, the relaxed After Climb sessions, and which is surely going to be spectacular, the “Petzl night with Said Belhaj”. Said had just a big feature in the current Rock &amp; Ice 216 (great read, go get the Magazin!), and I met him briefly last year at the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/outdoor-fair-2013/">Outdoor</a> so am very much looking forward to climbing with him. But there’s more, Stefan Lindblom and Krister Jonsson as well as UIAGM Mountain Guide &amp; Organizer Anders Bergwall are again along to teach you about proper crampon &amp; tool techniques, and show you how multi-pitch climbing is done well. And they’ll let you pick their brains from years of climbing on ice and mixed and other outdoor shenanigans!</p>

<p>As you see, there’s really plenty for everyone, and the four days surely will fly by way too fast. You can read all the details on the <a href="http://www.arcticguides.com/events">Arctic Guides</a> website, and then it’s time to <a href="http://www.arcticguides.com/wp-system/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/AICF-2014-Prices.pdf">book your festival pass</a> and plan the trip north! You can also <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AbiskoIceClimbingFestival">follow on Facebook</a> and keep an eye on the new <a href="http://www.abiskoiceclimbing.com/">Abisko Ice Climbing</a> website which will launch soon. See you in Absiko!</p>

<p><em>If you’re coming from Finland, we still have one seat free in the car from Vaasa (via a night in Rovaniemi on the way up), if you want to drive with us - <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#104;&#101;&#110;&#100;&#114;&#105;&#107;&#064;&#104;&#105;&#107;&#105;&#110;&#103;&#105;&#110;&#102;&#105;&#110;&#108;&#097;&#110;&#100;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;">be in touch</a>!</em></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Having been invited to the <a href="http://www.arcticguides.com/events">Abisko Ice Climbing Festival 2013</a> was an opportunity I couldn’t resist. A four hour ferry ride to Umeå and a nine hour train ride to Abisko later I arrived in one of Sweden’s Northernmost trail towns, which offers stunning Aurora Borealis, downhill skiing, husky tours and superb ice climbing.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8553149630/" title="Lapporten by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8380/8553149630_34b8f7fee8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Lapporten" /></a></p>

<p><em>“Hendrik?”</em></p>

<p><em>Yes.</em></p>

<p><em>“Welcome to the Abisko Ice Climbing Festival! I see you’re already wearing your climbing shoes, just drop your stuff here and head down to the canyon, you can get all the gear at the Petzl tent and the Demo Session is soon starting!”</em></p>

<p>After this friendly welcome from Anders Bergwall, UIAGM/ IFMGA Mountain Guide, owner of <a href="http://www.arcticguides.com/">Arctic Guides</a>, and Organiser of the AICF I quickly changed into my climbing pants and headed down to the Abisko river canyon, where indeed already a lot of people where climbing and chatting. But before I could climb I needed some gear, and so I went into the huge Tentipi tent and got from the friendly employees from <a href="http://www.c2safety.com/">C2 Vertical Safety</a> a pair of crampons (Petzl Darts), a pair of ice tools (Petzl Quarks), a harness (the new Petzl Sama) and a helmet (the new Petzl Sirocco, wonderfully light!). Well equipped I headed down to the canyon and started to chat with some of the other climbers while I was waiting for my turn.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8544509865/" title="Abisko Ice Climbing Festival 2013 by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8238/8544509865_6caa945cb0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="682" alt="Abisko Ice Climbing Festival 2013" /></a></p>

<p>It didn’t take too long and after a quick introduction and a buddy check with my belayer Rafael Jensen I was up the ice. The route was not too difficult, and already pretty hewn out from previous climbers, but for someone who was already travelling for about 12 hours it was just right. Back down Rafael gave me a few tips, and then I was already again knotting a Figure 8 knot and going up the second route. </p>

<p>After getting in five climbs it was time to check out the Demo Session from the Petzl climbers. They showed some nice Mixed climbing on a vertical cliff and ice climbing on an impressive waterfall further back in the canyon. But I was getting hungry, so I returned most of the Petzl gear as I brought my own, and just held on the the Sirocco helmet, which is wonderful. At the <a href="http://www.svenskaturistforeningen.se/sv/upptack/Omraden/Lappland/Fjallstationer/STF-Abisko-Turiststation/">STF Turist Station Abisko</a> I relaxed till Dinner started, and then headed shortly to the cabin to drop my backpacks before heading back to the presentations.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.robert-jasper.de/">Robert Jasper</a>, a German Alpinist, had a presentation about his ascent of the Eiger Northface by the Japanese Route, Erwann from Petzl showed us a video of a truly impressive ice climb up a waterfall which he can see from his office (<a href="http://youtu.be/xLsFUtbX51Y">see it here</a>) while Alban told us more about the new Petzl gear we could try this weekend. After such a long day it was time to hit the hay, and I went with my room mates back to the cabin. </p>

<p>Friday morning I got up early and headed for breakfast to the STF Station. In case you haven’t been there, the breakfast alone is a good reason to visit - it was superb! Delicious, freshly baked breads, scrambled eggs &amp; bacon, porridge and different berry soups guarantee a great start into the day. After we made our own lunches from the breakfast buffet, with a few tasty additions like GORP, Chocolate and drinks, it was gathering the gear and heading to the Lounge, waiting for the cars. </p>

<p>Todays climbing was at a nearby roadside cliff, which had about ten frozen waterfalls waiting for us. We were quickly separated into different groups while a few of the Pros set up Topropes for us, and then it was ice climbing time! </p>

      <td>Proper Crampon use”&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>I was with the Beginner group, and Anders from Arctic Guides started off with telling us about proper crampon use. After that we traversed in half a meter height along a ice fall, while the Guides checked on how we used the crampons and gave us tips on how to do it better. After this it was time to get climbing on topropes, first at the beginner’s wall, then, as confidence, technique and skills increased on the intermediate wall.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8551950715/" title="Intermediate Wall by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8368/8551950715_f738b9cd1b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Intermediate Wall" /></a></p>

<p>In between there were some more clinics, and especially the “How to create an Abalakov thread” one was very interesting. By using an ice screw you create a V shaped channel in solid ice, through which you then thread a cord or the rope directly to abseil. It allows you to leave no expensive gear behind (and with a single <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/eisschrauben.html">ice screw</a> costing upwards of 50€, that’s very welcome indeed!) and if done correctly is very safe.</p>

<p>After six hours of intense climbing and clinics we were shuttled back to the STF Station, but some of us still had enough energy left and so headed down to the Abisko Canyon. Together with Sanna, a local Skiguide, we climbed in the canyon, first on the same wall as the previous day, then we decided to try our skills on the waterfall behind the open pool where the advanced climbers were climbing the previous day. </p>

<p>Sanna went first, and standing next to the flowing water on a thin strip of frozen ice I was belaying her. She climbed the route until she was out of sight, topping out on a small ledge. Over the roaring of the water we communicated, and I abseiled her down, we both psyched that she did this hard route! I knotted in and set off, though half way up I needed to get down - my hands were pumped and to my defence I can say that Erwann from Petzl needed to go up the route to clean it - it was already late, and we were the last ones climbing =) </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8577417208/" title="Looking down by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8238/8577417208_9a6ebc7f66_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Looking down" /></a></p>

<p>In the After Climb Lounge <a href="http://www.kristerjonsson.se/Kristerjonson/International_Mountainguide_because_of_his_great_passion_for_Mountains_and_People.html">Krister Jonsson</a> took us to Kyrgisiztan, where he climbed   in 2012 for three weeks with his fiancée magnificent peaks and walls in a superb setting.  After a good Dinner the presentations continued, taking us on a expedition to Patagonia and ice climbing in China, both very inspiring. But Saturday we would start early, so it was to bed early, too.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8576322159/" title="Great Ice! by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8251/8576322159_bf671406fd_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Great Ice!" /></a></p>

<p>The Alarm rang at six o’clock, and an half hour later the great breakfast was enjoyed again. I joined Alban &amp; Erwann from Petzl and Robert Jasper in their car as we journeyed to Spansdalen in Norway. It was a fun trip, and all of us were in awe: As soon as we passed the Swedish - Norwegian border high peaks rose upward,  much higher and steeper than anything we had seen to date in Sweden. Later the Swedes told us that it indeed seems to be along the complete Border this way - the round fjells on the Swedish side, the high peaks on the Norwegian side. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8576525701/" title="Norway by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8509/8576525701_d6ae3f091d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Norway" /></a></p>

<p>We arrived in Spansdalen, the “Valley of Ice” in Norway and dropped the Pros and Advanced climbers at Henrikkafossen, a 8-Pitch route which looked like superb fun. We drove a bit further up the valley to more moderate climbs, and while the first four groups set off to climb various Multipitch routes others stayed behind and took part in a few more clinics - from building belay stations to different alternatives of rappelling. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8576320223/" title="Rappeling Clinic by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8516/8576320223_933ccd7e4b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Rappeling Clinic" /></a>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8576321517/" title="Intermediate Wall by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8378/8576321517_603b5b90bc_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Intermediate Wall" /></a></p>

<p>After a while it was Sara and my turn to go climbing, and we joined Stefan Lindblom from <a href="http://www.vertikalguiden.se/concrete/">Vertikal Guiden</a>. Stefan lead climbed on a half-rope so that he could belay Sara &amp; me from the belay ledge, and once he set up his belay Sara &amp; me simu-climbed up to him. The belay was on an exposed ledge and the wind was blowing coldly, so it was good that I brought my belay vest along to stay warm. </p>

<p>Sara belayed Stefan this time on the 2nd pitch, which was a lot harder than the first one, with a very steep vertical section. My hands pumped, the cold wind blowing, I pushed on, taking out the ice screws &amp; quick-draws Stefan placed, until I finally made it to the top. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8577421940/" title="Stefan leading by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8089/8577421940_6db928fa2c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Stefan leading" /></a>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8577422832/" title="Sorting ropes by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8250/8577422832_61f31c64b7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Sorting ropes" /></a></p>

<p>Up on the top Stefan belayed Sara till she too made was with us. If you go up, you also need to get back down and so we sorted ropes and set up everything for abseiling back down. We used the new <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/petzl-reverso-4-belay-device.html">Petzl Reverso 4</a> to go down, and abseiling the 45 m ice fall was good fun. After we were all safely back at the start of the climb it was time to coil ropes and head back to the car, as it was getting late and we had still a 1,5 hour ride back to Abisko in front of us.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8577735844/" title="Petzl Reverso 4 by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8234/8577735844_86d4c770cb_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Petzl Reverso 4" /></a></p>

<p>But what should have been 1,5 hour ride became a 3 hour ride, as we were waiting for 1,5 hours to cross the pass back into Sweden. Because of the strong winds the road was closed and one could only pass it in a convoy. There also was an accident, and so we sat in the car, chatting and waiting for the support vehicles to arrive and escort us across the pass. As we crossed the pass in the convoy the wind was blowing strongly, though I still spotted a few skiers on the loipes, heading back to their huts or cars.</p>

<p>Back in Abisko we enjoyed a presentation from Stefan, who ice climbs a lot in abandoned mines in his region, rather interesting places with many curious stories connected to them. After the Festival Dinner we listened closely as Rafael Jensen told of the first Swedish expedition to K2, a very touching story as three of the six members who stood on the summit of this Himalayan peak died on the descent. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8576458309/" title="Abisko Canyon by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8392/8576458309_581552ba62_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Abisko Canyon" /></a>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8576458643/" title="Petzl Laser Ice Screw by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8098/8576458643_fee6677709_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Petzl Laser Ice Screw" /></a></p>

<p>On Sunday we started a bit later than the previous days, and I headed after nine to the Abisko canyon for the final ice climbing of the weekend. It was a beautiful, sunny day with temps in the -14°C range. Stefan and Anders set a few topropes for us, and so we soon started to climb again. I tried various mixed routes that day, where one climbs rock &amp; ice with tools &amp; crampons, and while I was sceptical at first I enjoyed it immensely. It is a whole new sort of climbing, in parts easier, in parts harder than pure ice climbing or rock climbing. Heading up a steep wall with fine cracks, and only here and there ice features, is something every climber should try - it is great fun, and pushes your thinking to new levels. </p>

<p>But all good things come to an end, and so slowly the participants from near and far started to depart, catching trains, buses, planes or car rides down south. I myself stored my ice climbing gear away and got my Hyperlite Mountain Gear Porter, a pair of Dynafit Broadpeak skis and TLT5 boots and headed for the Kungsleden. But that’s another story.</p>

<p>Did this get you psyched about ice climbing in Abisko and surroundings, trying out new gear and learning from the Pros? Then follow the Arctic Guides on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/arcticguides">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/arcticguides">Twitter</a> to hear about the AICF 2014, or visit one of their <a href="http://www.arcticguides.com/courses/isklattring">ice climbing courses</a>.</p>

<p>I’d like to thank all the awesome participants of the AICF, especially Anders &amp; Merja from Arctic Guides, Stefan, Rafael, Robert and Krister for teaching &amp; guiding us, my room mate Dorian for the good company, Lo for letting me sleep at her place, Sara &amp; Mikeal from C2 Vertical Safety as well as Alban &amp; Erwann from Petzl for the possibility to loan great gear. I’m looking forward to climbing with you again next year!</p>

<p>Since last year I’m enamoured with ice climbing, and this year is going to be the year where I whack my ice tools and crampon-fitted boots into frozen waterfalls until I reach the summit. While <a href="http://amzn.to/TB6oXw">reading</a> about it is certainly a good way to get prepared, you actually should do a <a href="http://www.adventurepartners.fi/pirunkallio.aspx">course</a> or visit an <a href="http://www.arcticguides.com/events">Ice Climbing Festival</a> like this one in beautiful Abisko, Sweden - rather famous as being a) the Village where the superb Kungsleden Trail starts and b) one of the best places to see Northern Lights. </p>

<p>The Abisko Ice Climbing Festival (AICF), organized by the <a href="http://www.arcticguides.com/">Arctic Guides</a>, is an arctic festival for all ice climbing enthusiasts, so it is perfectly suited for everyone, from the beginner over to those who have a basic foundation in ice climbing and now want to strengthen their skills as well as seasoned ice climbers. At the festival you can join climbing clinics and get coaching by professional instructors &amp; international climbers, which is the best way to learn about this fascinating sport. You also can test new gear - <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/petzl.html">Petzl</a> is one of the Partners, so expect there to be plenty of <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/petzl-nomic-eisgeraet.html">Nomic tools</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/petzl-lynx-steigeisen.html">Lynx crampons</a> around! - and, if you’re competitively minded, join a competition! The climbing takes places on the ice falls around Abisko, from Kaisepakte till Spansdalen in Norway so besides great climbing you can expect superb scenery. And with <a href="http://www.xn--hjdmeter-n4a.se/">Höjdmeter.se</a> as another Partner I imagine there will also be some opportunities to try some great skiing gear!</p>

<p>After the climbing you can listen to interesting lectures and watch the latest climbing films, or just chill with fellow climbers from around the world. The festival base camp is at the <a href="http://www.svenskaturistforeningen.se/en/Discover-Sweden/Facilities-and-activities/Lappland/Fjallstationer/STF-Mountain-station-Abisko/">STF Abisko mountain station</a> which offers accommodation, too - so you don’t need to travel far! Transportation to the climbing locations is included in the Festival Pass, so that’s also taken care of!</p>

I’m very excited to travel north to Abisko and visit this Festival, I think it will be the perfect place to ice climb, meet like-minded people and enjoy the stunning scenery of Northern Sweden. If you’re going - comment underneath, it’d be cool to meet &amp; climb together! <strong>Getting to Abisko</strong> is easy: Jump on the train in Stockholm and get out in Abisko!
