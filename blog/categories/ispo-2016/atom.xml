<h2 id="scarpa">Scarpa</h2>

<p>A visit to <a href="http://scarpa.it">Scarpa</a> is a sure thing on any fair for me. This family company makes some of the best climbing &amp; mountaineering shoes on the market, has great, friendly athletes and makes simply cool shoes. Shoes like the Atom S, a trailrunning shoe that has a Sock-Fit construction like many other Scarpa shoes, too. The whole upper, including the gaiter, is made without a zipper and has an OutDry® lamination which makes the shoe warm &amp; dry even in the snow while keeping snow, dirt and other stuff out. It has a Vibram Lite Genetic Icetrek sole, but no info on weight or price. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24797609452/in/dateposted/" title="Scarpa Atom S"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1672/24797609452_53f1991431_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Scarpa Atom S" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24797604332/in/dateposted/" title="Scarpa Atom S Sole"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1706/24797604332_6489ee8381_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Scarpa Atom S Sole" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>A similar shoe is the Neutron G, a cold weather version of the Neutron just that this one has a gaiter with OutDry® lamination. It has a waterproof zip, a top strap and the internal closure lacing which allows for a good fit around your foot, with a Vibram GENETIC sole underneath for good grip on slippery surfaces. </p>

<p>Climbing shoes then. The Instinct gets a Lace version, a shoe for long Multi-pitch routes. TPU reinforcements on the side, seamless upper and a XS Vibram Edge sole. </p>

<p>The Instinct VS gets a Vibram XS Edge 2 sole.</p>

<p>The TX Pro is a versatile Telemark Boot for all Free-Heelers out there. </p>

<p>And the Mojito Basic Mid GTX is a pretty every day shoe which keeps the feet dry when it rains on your commute. </p>

<h2 id="black-diamond">Black Diamond</h2>

<p><a href="http://blackdiamondequipment.com">Black Diamond</a> makes seriously light &amp; high-quality gear so any aspiring Splitborder and ultralight backpacker does well to check their gear out. You weren’t able to go to the ISPO? Well good thing that I was there and swung by at BD! The Razor Carbon Ski Pole is made from aluminium and carbon, and the SwitchRelease easily opens for those situations where you need to get rid of the pole fast. It’s otherwise a normal strap that’s easy to get in and out of, and you can lock the strap also in place. They weigh 596 g and are available in two lengths: 110-125 cm and 115-140 cm. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24915606205/in/dateposted/" title="Black Diamond Razor Carbon Ski Pole"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1606/24915606205_013e500053_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Black Diamond Razor Carbon Ski Pole" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Storm headlamp weighs including batteries only 110 g and packs 250 Lumen, which illuminates the hills and forests up to 80 m far. It has the PowerTap™ Technology along which allows for fast &amp; simple transitioning between full and dimmed power in order to momentarily increase illumination in distance and proximity modes, and also has a Red and Green SinglePower LEDs for night vision along. It needs uses four AAA batteries and has a three-level power meter which shows the remaining battery life.</p>

<p>The Helio Cirque 35 Pack is a medium-sized ski pack which is designed for alpine expeditions. It is compatible with the BD AvaLung Element and has SwingArm™ shoulder straps. A Cinch closure as in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/07/patagonia-ascensionist-pack-45l.html">other packs</a> can be opened &amp; closed with one hand, there’s an optional SilNylon lid pocket available. Skis can be carried in an A-Frame or diagonally and as usual on BD packs, there’s the nice stowable helmet flap. </p>

<p>Onwards to garments and the First Light Hoody. It’s a breathable insulation piece filled with 60g/ m2 PrimaLoft® Silver Insulation Active and has a lightweight Schoeller shell which also has their Nanosphere DWR. The fit is regular and it weighs 440 g. As an alpine climbing/ mountaineering jacket it has a helmet-compatible hood and stows in its internal chest pocket, which also has a with carabiner clip. </p>

<h2 id="poc">POC</h2>

<p>Remember Rule 1? Good. <a href="http://www.pocsports.com">POC</a> from Sweden knows a thing about looking cool, as well as keeping you safe and in one piece when you’re out doing adventure sports. The Aspire shades underneath are some mean looking urban-inspired sunglasses which bring you back to the golden 60s - Don Draper would wear these, be assured. The Cold-Brown tint has been developed for urban environments, as the glasses allow you to better recognize contrasts in traffic and from stop lights. If you hike the streets - wear these.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24018857064/in/dateposted/" title="ISPO 2016 Impressions"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1627/24018857064_7c91a9fcaf_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="ISPO 2016 Impressions" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>You rather be safe than look cool? Well, with the POC Layer System you can have both. It’s an ISPO Award Winner and a baselayer that can be adapted to your needs in terms of safety. They have a seamless construction laser-cut pockets on on the shoulders, arms, thighs and knees which lets you slip in POC VPD System pads which have a 3D molded design for optimal coverage of the body. The top and bottoms themselves are quick-drying and made from a lightweight fabric, with mesh areas in the back and knees for better ventilation. Surely not something for hikers, but cyclists and skiers will find this useful.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24888083976/in/dateposted/" title="POC Layer 3"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1610/24888083976_51fb6ed0b7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="POC Layer 3" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Auric Pro features a Multi-impact VPD 2.0 + EPP liner, a durable ABS shell, can be used with a beanie and goggles under the helmet and has two sets of ear pads included. As a helmet for park riders I don’t expect to see this on the trails, but if you like to throw Miller Flips down the pipe this might be a piece of kit you’d like to have on your head. Oh, and it looks cool, too =)</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24286132574/in/dateposted/" title="POC Auric Pro Helmet"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1709/24286132574_95f6f98955_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="POC Auric Pro Helmet" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><em>The coolest</em> kit from POC is however, for me, their Googles. The Zeiss lenses now come with a Ripel treatment which makes them hydrophobic and oleophobic - so no more fingerprints and dried water drops will hinder your vision. The lenses now got thicker - a whooping 1,8 mm, and with 14 different google models to choose from and 11 different lens configurations it’s not easy to find the best POC Googles for you, but once you do - you’ll love them. And look cool. Like me and my <a href="http://bit.ly/1K9FXd5">LID</a>.</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer: I paid everything myself to visit the ISPO, so actually there’s nothing to disclose here. Except, possibly maybe, that one beer I drunk at Arc’teryx.</em></p>

<p>For starters read <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/02/ispo-2016-news-i.html">ISPO News Part I</a>.</p>

<h2 id="petzl">Petzl</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.petzl.com">Petzl</a> is hands-down my favourite climbing gear manufacturer so a stop at their booth is mandatory. The big news from them was something that made me as an ultralight backpacker and an aspiring ski-mountaineer very happy: An ultralight SkiMo kit that weighs in at 2 kg! </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24740315931/in/dateposted/" title="Petzl Fast &amp; Light SkiMo Gear"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1588/24740315931_e7cedf4f6a_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Petzl Fast &amp; Light SkiMo Gear" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The kit starts off with the Altitude Harness, which uses the WIREFRAME Technology so the whole harness weighs just 150 g! You can put it on without taking your skis or crampons off as I tried on the fair, and it packs very small. It is a minimalist mountaineering/ ski harness so ideal if you traverse a glacier or rappel down a couloir. It packs small, will cost around 70€ and is available from July 2016 (!) onwards.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24205648674/in/dateposted/" title="Petzl Altitude Harness 3"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1546/24205648674_0297af33e5_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Petzl Altitude Harness 3" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Leopard LLF is a ten point crampon that weighs 330 g for the pair! The CORD-TEC flexible linking system reduces crampon volume and yes, I asked about the durability of these cords: <em>“Prototypes have been used for over a year now and yet a cord needs to break.”</em> After all you’re gonna walk on snow with these, so there’s not really much chances of the cord getting broken - unlike if you use them on sharp rock. They pack really small, are easy to put on your boot and the sizes can be adjusted in seconds by putting the cord over the hooks in the back part. They too will be in July 2016 in the shops and cost 116€.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24833818525/in/dateposted/" title="Petzl Leopard LLF Crampon"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1681/24833818525_90767efc46_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Petzl Leopard LLF Crampon" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><em>“Now we just need an ice axe for skiers”</em> you might think, but Petzl thought this also and hence you’ll be able to buy the Ride ice axe in July for 80€. The axe is 45 cm long, a length which makes it easy to attach to backpacks or even carry them inside of a larger pack, and it weighs 240 g. The pick is made from steel and is 3 mm thick at the front so will penetrate ice well. It has a slight curve in the Type 1 shaft, felt good in my hand and is compatible with the <a href="https://www.bergzeit.de/petzl-linkin-handschlaufe/?pid=81">Petzl LINKIN Leash</a>.</p>

<p>The RAD Line was previously only available as part of the <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/petzl-rad-system-spaltenbergungsset/?pid=10239">RAD System</a>, but from July 2016 onwards you can buy the very light 60 m rope for 180€ also on its own. At 22 g per meter it is a great choice for glacier travel &amp; rescue as well as rappelling. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24205611464/in/dateposted/" title="Petzl RAD Line 2"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1492/24205611464_a94c2af985_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Petzl RAD Line 2" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>That was the climbing and mountaineering side of things, onwards to Lightning. There is coming a free MyPetzl Light mobile app for REACTIK+ and NAO+ connected headlamps in July to the Apple and Android Stores, which will work with the two named models, via Bluetooth. The Bluetooth is supposed to be low in energy consumption, and allows you to control the Headlamp via your phone in the same way you’re already now able to control the Nao via the Software on your computer. It sounds pretty good to be able to tell your headlamp for example that you will be out for six hours and hence want the optimal output over that period of time, all controlled from your phone. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24717705172/in/dateposted/" title="MyPetzl Light 1"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1576/24717705172_8665d394f5_b.jpg" width="576" height="1024" alt="MyPetzl Light 1" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24742106331/in/dateposted/" title="MyPetzl Light 2"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1479/24742106331_ce3620cb28_b.jpg" width="576" height="1024" alt="MyPetzl Light 2" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The two compatible headlamps are the Reactik+ and the Nao+. The latter will come with 750 Lumen and the former with 300 Lumen. The Nao will weigh 185 g, has a removable battery pack in the back which also has a red light so you’re seen from behind, and will cost 160€ once it comes out in October 2016. The Reactik+ will be 115 g light, costs 90€ and will already be available in July 2016.</p>

<h2 id="pieps">PIEPS</h2>

<p>This was my first visit at <a href="http://www.pieps.com">PIEPS</a>, the Austrian company specializing in Avalanche security gear. They presented their brand-new PIEPS MICRO, their smallest and lightest 3-antenna-beacon which comes with sensor technology and an app-controlled device management via Bluetooth. It has a big display for easy readability and a sensor which puts it automatically into search mode if you take it out of the holster. It’s 150 g light and has a size of 102 x 71 x 18 mm which makes it right now the smallest avalanche beacon on the market. It has a circular receiving range of 40 m which is a bit less than other 3-antenna beacons, but that’s not too big of a drawback. It will cost 350€.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24715994202/in/dateposted/" title="Pieps"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1691/24715994202_9558c585c5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Pieps" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The iPROBE II is the second generation of the iProbe, 350 g light and 220 cm long. The fully automatic electronic avalanche probe enables peers to be rescued even more quickly with its acoustic and visual hit indicator, which saves time &amp; reduces misinterpretations while pinpointing a buried friend. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24807579896/in/dateposted/" title="Pieps iProbe 2"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1585/24807579896_d8c387350e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Pieps iProbe 2" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Shovel C’s selling point is it’s C handle, which is easy to grip even with fat mitts on - unlike a T-handle. It comes in two weights: 660 g and 720 g, with a telescope shaft which is 88 cm and 90 cm long respectively. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24807591256/in/dateposted/" title="Pieps Shovel C"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1535/24807591256_760ecbc1b8_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Pieps Shovel C" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="patagonia">Patagonia</h2>

<p>There were three big news from <a href="http://bit.ly/1vVr6Wj">Patagonia</a>, but their Worn Wear campaign on the booth certainly was most interesting. There’s going to be a Worn Wear Campaign in Europe where a team of sewers will travel the continent and fix your broken Patagonia garments, so if you want something repaired keep an eye out for it on their website. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24206849183/in/dateposted/" title="DIY Repair Guide"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1657/24206849183_d646986eb8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="DIY Repair Guide" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24833700525/in/dateposted/" title="Fix it!"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1588/24833700525_b7b74283c1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Fix it!" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Then there’s the Patagonia exclusive PrimaLoft Gold Insulation Eco, a synthetic insulation made from 55% recycled content with 100% performance of normal Primaloft. PrimaLoft themselves were so positive about this new insulation material that they committed to replace all their PrimaLoft Gold Insulation with PrimaLoft Gold Insulation Eco beginning in 2017! All Patagonia Nano Puff styles - Vest, Pullover, Jacket and Hoody - come in Fall 2016 with the 60-g PrimaLoft Gold Insulation Eco. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24206866613/in/dateposted/" title="Patagonia Nano Puff Revolution"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1513/24206866613_9e94de0f1d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Patagonia Nano Puff Revolution" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24715847122/in/dateposted/" title="Patagonia Nano Puff Ingredients"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1470/24715847122_fecb658d93_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Patagonia Nano Puff Ingredients" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The second big news was the 100% recycled down. The 600 fill power goose and duck down is reclaimed from used items that can’t be resold and offers identical performance to virgin down. The first garments to use the material are the more urban-styled Bivy Down Jackets &amp; Vests, the M’s Down Snap-T® Pullover and the Down Shirts which could work well for backpacking and camping. No info on weights, sorry, prices go from 200€ to 250€ for these pieces.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24833771185/in/dateposted/" title="Patagonia Recycled Down"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1591/24833771185_c27a475bb4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Patagonia Recycled Down" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And then the technical Alpine gear. The Stretch Nano Storm Jacket I’m wearing underneath is the <a href="http://bit.ly/20M5T2i">Nano Air Hoody</a> wrapped into a H2No Performance Standard shell fabric, creating a jacket which keeps the elements at bay when you climb and while you belay your mate in a blizzard - no more need to pull on a belay parka with this one on. It will cost 470€, again sadly no infos on weights (but it wasn’t light). </p>

<h2 id="ortovox">ORTOVOX</h2>

<p><a href="http://ortovox.com">ORTOVOX</a> News coming in a wee bit!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24807370916/in/dateposted/" title="ORTOVOX Avabag &amp; Backpacks"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1447/24807370916_1c488efc66_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="ORTOVOX Avabag &amp; Backpacks" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="dps-skis">DPS Skis</h2>

<p>I do like my <a href="http://www.dpsskis.com">DPS Skis</a> so I scheduled a visit at their booth to see what’s coming next winter from this innovative ski maker. Brand-new next season is their Foundation Line pictured underneath, which uses best-in-class components to create a durable and long-lasting ski. From Polyamide topsheets over a bamboo and poplar core to a graphite race base, the Foundation skis should suit a wide variety of skiers. Benefits of the Foundation skis include effortless turn initiation, a solid and powerful drive from mid-turn to exit and that the skis throughout the line feel familiar if you belong to those people who need more than one pair of skis.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24564799671/in/dateposted/" title="DPS Skis Foundation Line Skis"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1504/24564799671_e760f4a422_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="DPS Skis Foundation Line Skis" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>But I was more interested in the new Tour1 models. Tour1 is DPS’ backcountry/ ski-touring build of skis which are very light but have great downhill performance - fast up and fun on the way to the valley. The (green) Cassier 87 is the ultralight ski for fast ascents as it fits into thin skintracks and weighs just 1340 g at 178 cm length. At 121/ 87/ 109 it still offers good all-snow and all-mountain performance, for fun days out on the hills.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24740258271/in/dateposted/" title="DPS Skis Tour1 Skis"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1454/24740258271_02c432cf2a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="DPS Skis Tour1 Skis" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24538223670/in/dateposted/" title="DPS Skis Tour1 Cassier 87"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1542/24538223670_3dcc705fd9_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="DPS Skis Tour1 Cassier 87" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The (blue) Wailer 106 is also new, weighs 1.440 g at 178 cm length and has the fine measurements of 133/ 106/ 122. DPS suggests this ski as your one ski if you life in a region which sees consitent snow, measured in centimeters and not meters, as it fits well into the skin track and delivers broad pleasures and predicable precision with its Chassis-driven rocker &amp; sidecut design.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24833749245/in/dateposted/" title="DPS Skis Tour 1 Wailer 106"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1620/24833749245_3e0bbc75e4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="DPS Skis Tour 1 Wailer 106" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And then there’s the beautiful Tour1 Zelda 106 ski in awesome purple for Women. It weighs 1.340 g in 168 cm length and a bit less in 158 cm length. A ski for ladies who are out already with the first snow in late November and will first leave the mountains in June when even on Lyngen the last snow is melting away, the Zelda 106 should be a great touring skis. Did I mention that I love the colour? Good.</p>

<h2 id="spark-rd">Spark R&amp;D</h2>

<p>Splitboarding? Yes! And whom better to visit than <a href="http://www.sparkrandd.com">Spark R&amp;D</a>, who celebrate their 10 year anniversary this year - congratulations! In case you’re now pondering what Splitboarding is - well, it’s a Snowboard broken down in the middle so that you can skin up the mountain with it - as with skis - and then you put it back together and snowboard down the hill. Their Tesla T1 Binding System has won numerous awards and the Surge binding underneath is Spark’s binding for big lines. They’re not new but have updated colours for the next season.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24205723804/in/dateposted/" title="Spark R&amp;D Bindings"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1442/24205723804_a0ee7888d0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Spark R&amp;D Bindings" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>As Splitborders also go up steep pointy bits a crampon like the Ibex is useful to get more grip. Available in different widths and compatible with the bindings.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24205728764/in/dateposted/" title="Spark R&amp;D Crampon"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1573/24205728764_736702f168_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Spark R&amp;D Crampon" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Dyno DH is Spark’s Splitboard binding for hardboots - think <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/12/arcteryx-procline-carbon-lite-ski-boot.html">Arc’teryx Procline</a> and similar. Tour up with normal front pieces for touring up, then slide the Dyno DH on the pucks and you’re ready to snowboard down with your hardboots. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24205793984/in/dateposted/" title="Spark R&amp;D Dyno DH 2"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1548/24205793984_2eccf32b12_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Spark R&amp;D Dyno DH 2" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>New from Spark is the Zip Strap underneath, which increases the glide on flat and low angled terrain. It covers the skin with a slippery plastic film which allows you to feel like you’re on cross country skis and move faster, all without needing to take the skins off. When not needed it rolls up to a tiny package.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24740467991/in/dateposted/" title="Spark R&amp;D Zip Strip 3"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1514/24740467991_cc672ff1a4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Spark R&amp;D Zip Strip 3" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The Splitboard skins from Spark are made by G3 and come with the Spark Tailclips which attach great to your Splitboard in touring mode. For the next season they got a new look, otherwise they’re just as great as they have been.</p>

<h2 id="rjk">Röjk</h2>

<p>Jan dreamed up a great Range for 2017, and this time <a href="http://rojksuperwear.com">Röjk</a> goes Oriental. Linus was wearing the new garments already and they looked mighty fine, with smart details, comfortable &amp; functional materials, pretty colours and cool designs. The T-Shirts for Gals &amp; Guys are made from 60% Merino and 40% Modal and will set you back 75€ once they hit the stores. That’s pretty pricey, but just remember Rule 1: <em>Always look cool™</em>. </p>

<p>The highlight for me in the new range was the Atlas pants. They not just look great, but what really was amazing that the complete pants - from fabric over buttons to sewing - is made within a 45 km radius of Stockholm, Sweden. That’s pretty rad, especially considering the pants is a reasonable 135€. Well, the pants also look good, obviously, have a high stretch and are made from a bluesign-certified, environmental fabric. And that yellow hoody Linus is wearing underneath - that’s the Cordura Zippenhood, which is pretty durable and looks good, too.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24144796084/in/dateposted/" title="Röjk Atlas Pants"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1557/24144796084_4d91fe28f6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Röjk Atlas Pants" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Micropile Jacket is 40% lighter than the <a href="http://rojksuperwear.com/guys/guys-primaloft-bomberpile-cocoa.html">Primaloft Bomber Pile</a> and has 45% Primaloft Polyester in it. At 160€ it’s cheaper than its aforementioned big brother, and goes for a more casual look that works well for hiking &amp; trekking as well on a cold day in the office. </p>

<p>Finally, the Mounter Hoody. 15% Merino wool, 8% Elastane for stretchiness and the rest is Polyester which makes for a nice looking midlayer. The texture of the hoody is a bit like jersey fabric, which is interesting and something fresh. </p>

<h2 id="inov-8">inov-8</h2>

<p><em>What happens if you have a free half an hour on the ISPO, Hendrik?</em> Well, dear reader, there were very few free half hours on the ISPO but in one of those I was navigating the hallways of always and stumbled upon <a href="http://www.inov-8.com">inov-8</a>. As it was early on Sunday morning the booth wasn’t full yet so I was able to grab Matt, the Designer and a Marketing person and go through the new kit that will be coming in the near future. I even met an old acquaintance at the booth: The inov-8 Roclite 286 GTX, which will return just as it was. Woohoo!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24144726364/in/dateposted/" title="inov-8 Roclite 286 GTX"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1673/24144726364_178e666a48_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="inov-8 Roclite 286 GTX" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>But these fairs are not about meeting old friends, but the new kids on the block. The AT/C Thermoshell HZ is one of these, and at 223 g in Mens’ M with a 40 g/ m2 Polartec Alpha insulation it’s probably one of the lightest breathable insulation jackets on the market. It packs into its own pocket, has a deep zipper for venting and the Pertex Quantum shell keeps a cold breeze &amp; drizzle at bay while you’re running up the foggy fjells.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24405194939/in/dateposted/" title="inov-8 AT/C Thermoshell HZ"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1505/24405194939_aba2d72188_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="inov-8 AT/C Thermoshell HZ" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And because you might need a wee pack to put the AT/C Thermoshell HZ into when you’re up on the sunny summit, you might want to carry the RaceUltra Boa pack. This pack has an included Hydrapak reservoir which sits on your hips so the weight is lower, and you can adjust the fit via a Boa closure system. I quizzed Matt, the designer, about the durability of the Boa System and he had no issues during testing with it, so I’m looking forward to hear how other users will find this in use. Anyway. The Boa System lets you compress the reservoir and pack to your pack so it’s not bouncing around while you bomb down the trail. The 10 l main compartment packs all the gear you will need to carry on an Ultra, a large outside mesh pocket that can be accessed from the sides, loops for poles and small pockets in the front allow you to carry all you need. A soft cup and an emergency blanket are included in the pack, so it’s ready for races like the UTMB where these items are required.</p>

<p>Have you heard about this season where white stuff is on the ground? That’s the season the ArcticClaw 300 Thermo and ArcticClaw 300 were made for. These replace the good old OROC and have more carbide spikes for even more grip, which are also re-arranged to give more grip (= spikes) under the fore-foot. The difference between these two shoes is that the Thermo has an additional Primaloft lining, so you can keep on running and hiking in very cold weather without your toes complaining! A Standard fit makes them great choices for those with wide feet, while the ArcticTalon 275 has a Performance Fit which is better for races. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24477310770/in/dateposted/" title="inov-8 ArcticClaw 300 Thermo"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1455/24477310770_fdb1a98251_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="inov-8 ArcticClaw 300 Thermo" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Also new is the X-Talon 225. I’m a huge <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/inov-8-x-talon-212-trailrunningschuhe-bf/?pid=10239">X-Talon 212</a> Fan, and the 225 has less cushioning than the 212 and is more durable, so should be a shoe which probably will be very popular with many ultralight backpackers. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24146042653/in/dateposted/" title="inov-8 X-Talon 225"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1519/24146042653_7de9396ff6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="inov-8 X-Talon 225" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24279252869/in/dateposted/" title="ISPO 2016 Impressions"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1509/24279252869_b07016a6f3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="ISPO 2016 Impressions" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>If you prefer more cushioning and a Standard Fit (= Wide Fit) then the X-Talon 200 will be a good choice. This X-Talon also has less cushioning as the 212 but the Standard fit will make it popular with those who find inov-8’s Performance fit just too constricting. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24144690094/in/dateposted/" title="inov-8 X-Talon 200"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1614/24144690094_472ae20891_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="inov-8 X-Talon 200" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The other popular shoes from inov-8 - like the Roclites - all got a face lift with some nice new graphics, while the TrailTalon 275 underneath is also one of those new kids. Made for long days on hard trails it sounds like a good shoe for hiking highways like the Kungsleden and PCT.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24679364871/in/dateposted/" title="inov-8 TrailTalon 275"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1447/24679364871_db8c890c81_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="inov-8 TrailTalon 275" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="rab">Rab</h2>

<p>Are you in need of a 1000 cuin jacket? Then get ready to save 500€ for the Zero G jacket from <a href="http://rab.equipment/">Rab</a>. At 310 g in Size L you really get a super-light jacket, which the Pertex Quantum GL 7d fabric and the 1000 cuin RDS certified down will be responsible for. It has a slim fit and alpine features like a helmet-compatible hood and two hand warmer pockets to store small items on the go.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24680351211/in/dateposted/" title="Rab Zero G Jacket"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1679/24680351211_3c6c890b79_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Rab Zero G Jacket" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>If you’re more concerned about your gear being waterproof <em>and</em> warm, then the Resolution Jacket will be for you. It has welded seams with a bonded box-wall construction for the hydrophobic 800 cuin down inside, and the relaxed fit means it’s a belay jacket you throw over while your mate climbs up the rime on Ben Nevis and a blizzard is pounding the mountain. A helmet compatible hood keeps your head warm and inside there’s large pockets to dump gloves and dry them out a tiny little bit. At 500€ you’ll also want to save for this one before it comes out later in 2016.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24145717834/in/dateposted/" title="Rab Resolution Jacket"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1510/24145717834_3a8c9f76a5_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Rab Resolution Jacket" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><em>So, was there any new material on the ISPO?</em> Good that you ask, Polartec Alpha Direct is indeed a new version of Polartec Alpha. The marketing spin: <em>“Alpha Direct has removed the inner lining, allowing moisture vapour to move quickly through the fibres and resulting in exceptional breathability and fast dry times when on the move.”</em> As a sweaty guy this sounds good to me, and the purple women’s colour also looks pretty good to me. A slim fit and two zippered hand pockets and stretchy fleece cuffs make it a comfy jacket for those who move fast in the mountains but don’t want to shed/ put on layers every few hundred meters.</p>

<p>Say <em>Hello</em> to Merino+, the re-launched MeCo. <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2012/11/hoodylicious.html">Hoodies are great</a> and the Merino+ 160 Hoody certainly looks the deal. It is 279 g in Size L (so even lighter in my Size S!), has thumb loops, a deep zipper for dumping excess heat and flat seams which are more comfortable under a backpack and layers. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24145766714/in/dateposted/" title="Rab Merino+ 160 Hoody"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1594/24145766714_2176b6451a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Rab Merino+ 160 Hoody" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And then there still was the Asylum Jacket. It’s 270€ and a jacket to keep you warm at the crag and blocs. Nice stretchy wrist gaiters keep the hands warm and the great colours go well with Rule 1. Very large internal mesh pockets allow you to keep your <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/06/scarpa-stix.html">climbing shoes</a> toasty inside your jacket while you belay or spot your mate. At 1.016 g it certainly ain’t light, but then that’s seldom a concern when you stand at the crag. Filled with hydrophobic, RDS-certified 650 cuin down.</p>

<h2 id="haglfs">Haglöfs</h2>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24146213123/in/dateposted/" title="Haglöfs Booth - Beat The Elements"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1556/24146213123_14e08d91f8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Haglöfs Booth - Beat The Elements" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a href="http://www.haglofs.com/">Haglöfs</a> is worth a visit for a growing number of oudoor enthusiasts, from skiers over mountaineers to hikers and urban folks who like to dress in a way that they can go out in a blizzard. The Selja Jackets underneath are from the 19Fourteen range, and are 3-in-1 jackets that are bluesign® approved with a 3L Gore-Tex shell jacket and a liner jacket which has a Pertex® Eco shell fabric and QuadFusion+™ insulation. Both jackets - liner and shell - can be used on its own or then easily clipped together. The jackets have some technical features like a storm flap behind the zipper and an adjustable hood. I do like the clean &amp; sophisticated look, though the weight of 1.110 g in Size L is pretty heavy. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24655091662/in/album-72157661680650583/" title="Haglöfs Selja Jackets"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1699/24655091662_c2eaa7f8eb_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Haglöfs Selja Jackets" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Couloir Jacket (Men’s in Orange, Women’s in Purple) is a hybrid garment which combines Gore-Tex C-knit with a softshell material. It’s made for freeriding but Haglöfs thinks it is also good to use for trekking and mountaineering. It weighs 605 g in Size L (Women’s 510 g in M), with a snap-away snow skirt, pit zips, articulated sleeves for freedom of movement and an adjustable hood. There’s a matching pants - the Couloir Pant - which weighs 615 g in Size L for the Men’s - and is made from 3L Gore-Tex Softshell material with the standard Schoeller Keprotec patches at the inside of the lower leg. A nice looking combination for the skiers out there. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24405303199/in/album-72157661680650583/" title="Haglöfs Couloir Ski Jackets"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1572/24405303199_00b95ca66e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Haglöfs Couloir Ski Jackets" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And then there was lightweight warmth and weather protection, too! The Spitz Jacket on the right (and the opener photo) is a Gore-Tex Pro Jacket and a got an update for the 2017 season. It got reinforcements in the shoulder, sleeve, back and hip sections for durability, Pit zips for venting and large pockets to store gear on the go. The jacket is shorter now to not interfere with your harness and is 490 g in Size L. </p>

<p>The Essens Mimic Hood is insulated with synthetic QuadFusion™ Mimic which mimics down but is beter in wet conditions. There’s on chest pocket and two zippered hand warmer pockets on the jacket, with the hood having a formable peak and of course it can be adjusted, too. The pictured Women’s model will be 210 g in Size M, while the Men’s version without hood will tip the scales at 260 g in L. </p>
