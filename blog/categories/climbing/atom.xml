The New Millennium</em> as <a href="http://www.tyroliaverlag.at/list?back=9db5a3e1b607eeefc414b4266862f7c2&amp;xid=11345923">Herausforderung 8000er</a> is called in English, should be on your bookshelf. Packed with detailed information and chronics from the first ascents to the newest route attempts, Herausforderung 8000er is required reading if you want to climb one of the highest mountains.</p>

<p>After reading <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2015/01/alan-hinkes-8000-meters.html">8000 Metres</a> and <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2015/01/jon-griffith-alpine-exposures.html">Alpine Exposures</a> Herausforderung 8000er from the <a href="http://www.tyroliaverlag.at/">Tyrolia Verlag</a> is the third book in the mountaineering corner on my bookshelf which is about the highest of peaks. Besides detailed topographic photos and lists of the first ascents on the different routes it are the captivating stories from the ascents and expeditions which are worth getting this book. </p>

<p>The book has 17 chapter - after an introduction each 8.000 m peak has its own chapter where stories about the first ascents, the different expeditions, tragic accidents and solo ascents are given, with lists on the first ascents on the many routes on the peaks. It gets interesting in the “The New Millennium” sections, where stories about more current ascents are told. So the book goes from Annapurna to Shisha Pangma and then finishes with an outlook on the next decade and all relevant statistics.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16399669221" title="Herausforderung 8000er - On Top of the World by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7380/16399669221_1d67e65f4a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="796" alt="Herausforderung 8000er - On Top of the World" /></a></p>

<p>Not just the stories are captivating, also the superb photos from the mountains &amp; expeditions will let you forget the time when you’re reading this book. It highlights how some 8.000 m mountains nowadays can be attempted by normal people while at the same time alpinists on the cutting edge still find new routes up these same peaks. If you dream about standing on the top of the world on one of these mountains, then you should get Herausforderung 8000er - <em>On Top of the World. The New Millennium</em>.</p>

    <id>http://hikinginfinland.com/2015/01/jon-griffith-alpine-exposures</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Jon Griffith’s photo book <a href="http://www.alpineexposures.com/pages/book">Alpine Exposures</a> is the culmination of over ten years photographing in the Alps. Full of breath-taking images that depict some of the best ways to move in the mountains, this is the coffee table book you wanted for those days where you can not head out yourself or need some motivation to get up at 1 am.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16050375500" title="alpine exposures - Jon Griffith by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7577/16050375500_2694d126ac_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="alpine exposures - Jon Griffith" /></a></p>

<p>I have been following Jonathan Griffith’s photography since many years via his <a href="http://www.alpineexposures.com/blogs/chamonix-conditions">blog</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Alpine-Exposures-Jon-Griffith-Photography/120793041299250">Facebook</a> so when word came out that he was working on a photo book I knew it would be superb. Jon regularly kept readers and Fans up to date about the process of producing and publishing this book, and just in time for the holidays the alpine exposures came out last November. </p>

<p>Alpine Exposures starts off with a Foreword by Ueli Steck which is one of the best forewords I have read in a while. Honest and appraising, highlighting why Jon takes such good photos (because he’s a mountaineer first, photographer second) Ueli sets the tone for the book and gets you excited to turn the pages. Jon follows that up with an equally touching Introduction before you meet some of Jon’s rope partners and then you can start to enjoy the photos.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16211793956" title="alpine exposures - Jon Griffith by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7496/16211793956_541519cb26_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="alpine exposures - Jon Griffith" /></a></p>

<p>The book is written in three languages: English, French and German. This lingual trinity is well executed with a good layout that’s easy to read and follow throughout the book. It’s high-quality paper that depicts the superb images very well, and it’s a pleasure to read the book. The photos all are from real situations, so no fake “Lets go to the Aiguille Du Midi and do some shoots on the Cosmiques” kind of photos. The seven distinct chapters in the book show Jon’s favourite photos from Alpinism, Skiing, Climbing, Landscape, Ice Climbing, Flight (BASE and Paragliding) and Work. In between the photos are here and there short anecdotes from climbs and work trips, and some climbs are highlighted in longer photo essays which not just give you an idea of the route if you’re planning to climb it yourself, it also adds variation to the book and makes it very interesting for alpinists that want to attempt some of these routes.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16050174968" title="alpine exposures - Jon Griffith by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7517/16050174968_925b8dd4f7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="alpine exposures - Jon Griffith" /></a></p>

<p>This is the coffee table book you wished you would have gotten as a present from Santa last Christmas. Cover to cover it features breathtaking photos from the mountains and people having fun in them, and will inspire you to make a trip to Chamonix as soon as possible so you can experience the beauty yourself. It’s a book for alpinists, climbers and photographers and you’ll have a hard time putting it down once you start to read it. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/kx49us95qxbuj0f/Alpine_Exposures_Sample.pdf?dl=0">View a 60 page sample online</a>, if you’re convinced (and you will be!) you can buy your copy of <em>alpine exposures</em> directly from Jon at <a href="http://www.alpineexposures.com/products/alpine-exposures-photo-book-10-years-of-photography-by-jon-griffith">Alpine Exposures</a>, your local book shop or order it online from <a href="http://amzn.to/1I10mLL">Amazon.co.uk</a>, <a href="http://amzn.to/1xYMvBb">Amazon.com</a> or <a href="http://amzn.to/1APW8EE">Amazon.de</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Getting the chance to join the <a href="http://www.petzl-roctrip.com/en">Petzl RocTrip</a> in Turkey last year definitely was one of the climbing highlights of 2014. Great locations, world-class climbers, superb weather and a beautiful country - so much to like!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15445756920" title="View from the Citdibi sector towards the Mediterranean Sea by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3939/15445756920_ed015cbd98_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="View from the Citdibi sector towards the Mediterranean Sea" /></a></p>

<p><strong>The Approach</strong> to Turkey was loooooong: Vaasa - Helsinki, Helsinki - Moscow, Moscow - Antalya, well over 14 hours of travelling. After I arrived I happily met <a href="http://vertical-axis.de">Nico</a> at the airport and after figuring out where to go we got into our ride to the Historic centre of Antalya. We stayed at the beautiful <a href="http://www.mediterraarthotel.com">Mediterra Art Hotel</a> which really was very comfy, even if I spent there less than 12 hours in total. I dropped my bags at the room and then headed for a tasty dinner high above the old harbour, where I also met my fellow Press members. It was a very mixed bunch and I was in esteemed company: Members from <a href="http://www.rockandice.com">Rock &amp; Ice</a>, <a href="http://www.grimper.com">Grimper</a>, <a href="http://desnivel.com">Desnivel</a>, <a href="http://outsideonline.se">Outside</a> and <a href="http://www.klettern.de">klettern</a> where there along with people from the <a href="http://www.climbing.fi/skil/">Finnish Climbing Association</a>, the <a href="http://www.clubalpin.be">Club Alpin Belge</a> and the <a href="http://www.nkbv.nl">NKBV</a> and several others. </p>

<h2 id="geyikbayiri">Geyikbayiri</h2>

<p>The next morning we took a short bus ride to Geyikbayırı, <em>THE</em> sport climbing spot. Imagine it like a spacious and very large natural amphitheatre and you get the idea of this place. Right in the centre is <a href="http://www.rockclimbingantalya.com">Kezban’s Guesthouse</a> where we dropped our bags and then headed to <a href="http://www.climbersgarden.com">Climber’s Garden</a> where we had lunch from the beautiful terrace, just a stone throw away from Kezban’s. We met Lafouche, the guy whose idea the RocTrip has been a long time ago and the only person who has been on each one, and <a href="http://www.maewan.com/en/">Erwan</a> who organizes it nowadays. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15632190602" title="Kezban Camping, Main House by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3936/15632190602_3760215cbf_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Kezban Camping, Main House" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15590093364" title="Lunch at Climber&#x27;s Garden, Geyikbayiri by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7535/15590093364_cf04498380_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Lunch at Climber&#x27;s Garden, Geyikbayiri" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16024978998" title="Tasty pastries by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7512/16024978998_e8016913eb_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Tasty pastries" /></a></p>

<p>Well, after a tasty meal it was finally time to hit the rock! We headed to the Trebenna Sector which was just a short stroll down a dirt road from Climber’s Garden. The sector is north-faced and so lay in the shade, and with temperatures which felt well into the high twenties that was certainly a good choice. Trebenna a good sector with routes from 5a to 8b+ so is ideal for all levels. I climbed a few easy routes with Anne, Piotr and Kristina but spend most of the time taking photos of the climbing that was going down. And there was lots of that!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16178042386" title="Unknown climber at Trebenna West Sector, Geyikbayiri by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7474/16178042386_a339a87ac4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Unknown climber at Trebenna West Sector, Geyikbayiri" /></a>

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16024981668" title="Looking down at Trebenna Sector by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7539/16024981668_fb6b8bc1f0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Looking down at Trebenna Sector" /></a></p>

<p>After the climbing it was Party time! Delicious grilled Kebabs and local beer were consumed before the music at the trailer started. A big party of the RocTrip is music and so Lafouche, Said Belhaj, Sean Villanueva and a handful more of people got on the stage of the converted Airstream trailer and started to jam. People loved it and the party went on till the wee hours, with the music sounding through the natural amphitheatre of Geyikbayiri.</p>

<h2 id="citdibi">Citdibi</h2>

<p>Citdibi is the sector to visit if you climb 7a and harder. You also should have plenty of stamina, as with routes up to 150 m high, much of them on overhangs, you will get pumped. As I didn’t bother putting the climbing shoes on here I just took photos and enjoyed watching as a lot of world-class climbers like Nina Caprez, Jon Cardwell, Dave Graham and many more were enjoying themselves on the beautiful tufa routes on this beautiful limestone crag. The sector has a bit of a strenuous approach but going back down is easy.</p>

<p>If you want to climb at Citdibi for several days you can stay less than 15 minutes on foot away at the gorgeous <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/928318137182778/">Masal Refuge</a>. It’s a beautiful cabin with a superb view to the surrounding mountains, the Mediterranean Sea, Antalya and everything in between. You probably should get groceries down in the valley, though, as I saw no supermarket close by. </p>

<h2 id="olympos">Olympos</h2>

<p>We didn’t linger long at Citdibi and continued to Olympos at the sea. The ride there was adventurous to say the least and involved driving on a “Shortcut I think there possibly maybe might be” through the mountains. We arrived in the dark at the final Basecamp, <a href="http://kadirstreehouse.com">Kadir’s Treehouse</a>.It looks like a beautiful place, with the cottages being all aloft in the air, with a large main building in the middle where breakfast &amp; dinner was served. We did stay a tad down the road in the Kadir Family House, which was OK. I wouldn’t go there with my family, but if you’re a climber looking for a place to sleep and a hot shower then it’s OK. Don’t bother ‘bout the Wifi, though, that doesn’t work. And as we weren’t there for sleeping but climbing it was fine.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16177982506" title="Olympos Beach"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8615/16177982506_b4d1812246_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Olympos Beach" /></a>

<p>The climbing then. There’s a bunch of sectors at Olympos and from slabs to vertical and overhangs, from easy 5a’s to 8b+ you can find at least a dozen of routes per grade, with most of them in the 6 and 7 category. Sectors also are very varied, from a shady &amp; narrow valley over high caves close to the sea to walls which are more in the sun. But if you don’t have trouble walking some 20 to 30 minutes you always can find a sector that’s in the shade - or just go relax at the wonderful beach and visit the ruins. </p>

<p>We visited half a dozen sectors while we stayed in Olympos, but the highlight for me was the Deep Water Soloing. Being able to climb to your limit and then just drop into the water if you can’t anymore is such an excellent way to climb that I hope to do more DWS in 2015 and the future. It’s super fun and pretty much everyone enjoyed the experience, and if you ever get the possibility to try it you totally should. Just take (<a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/rock-technologies-liquid-chalk/?pid=81">liquid</a>) chalk and a small towel, your <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/06/scarpa-stix.html">climbing shoes</a> and a swim shorts/ suit and you’re set!</p>

<p>Also the other climbing at Olympos is great, and best of all is that it’s a very family friendly area. There’s dozens of accommodation options and the street to the National Park entry is lined with Cafés, Kiosks and small restaurants so you won’t starve or die of thirst. </p>

<h2 id="how-to-plan-your-own-climbing-trip-to-turkey">How to plan your own climbing trip to Turkey</h2>

<p>You wanna get the <a href="http://www.climb-europe.com/RockClimbingShop/Antalya-Sports-Climbing-Guidebook.html">A Rock Climbing Guide to Antalya</a> Guide book which covers all the areas mentioned in this post, and if you’re hooked on Turkey also get the <a href="http://www.climbtravel.com">Climb Travel Turkey</a> book. You can get them with some luck online, but for sure you will get them at any of the Guesthouses/ Camping places in Geyikbayiri and Olympos. Both have a host of information on all that you need to know for climbing there, from gear tips to accommodation, food and of course detailed topos. Online you can check out <a href="http://climbgeyikbayiri.com/?page_id=2">Climb Geyikbayiri</a> and <a href="http://www.olymposrockclimbing.com/?lang=en">Olympos Rock Climbing</a> for some information.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15594290283" title="A Rock Climbing Guide to Antalya &amp; Climb Travel Turkey books by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7548/15594290283_8eecfb50c4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="A Rock Climbing Guide to Antalya &amp; Climb Travel Turkey books" /></a></p>

<p>Flying into Antalya is the best option, unless you want to do your own road trip in Turkey. Getting around is easy &amp; cheap via bus or more independent with a rental car, the latter could be useful if you want to visit all three locations. But the bussess to Geyikbayiri and Olympos are regular, and many of the guest houses in Geyikbayiri also might offer a pick-up from the airport.</p>

<p>At Citdibi there’s only the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/928318137182778/">Masal Refuge</a> for overnight accommodation, but in Geyikbayiri and Olympos you can choose from several options. I liked <a href="http://www.rockclimbingantalya.com">Kezban’s Guesthouse</a> and <a href="http://www.climbersgarden.com">Climber’s Garden</a>, both had friendly staff, where short walks away from the crag and had beautiful gardens where you can pitch your tents, pick pomegranates and olives and chat with climbers from Turkey and the world. </p>

<p>The food in Turkey was delicious and I recommend you try the local cuisine. Just be careful with the veggies at Kadir’s Tree House, especially the salad: They’re washed with the unsafe tap water and there were many that got sick from it, so better avoid the raw, washed veggies unless you have a really strong stomach who is not bother by a few bacteria. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16026622780" title="On the boat! by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7484/16026622780_15c67956ea_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="On the boat!" /></a></p>

<p>As for <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2011/08/ultralight-climbing.html">climbing gear</a>, a 60 or 70 m single rope and 12 to 18 quick-draws should have you covered for most sports routes. There are Trad routes around, but most of it is sports climbing so keep that in mind. A <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/petzl-sirocco-helmet.html">helmet</a> is recommended as there are overhangs and lose rock, especially at the sea-side sectors of Olympos. Don’t forget to take at least a 1 l bottle of water as it is hot and some snacks. </p>

<p>The best time to go seems to be between September and June, with the rainy season being in December/ January and the hot summer in July/ August. As there are a lot of caves and overhangs these still could be OK. </p>

<p><strong>Finally</strong>, if I’d go again there I’d likely would go to Olympos. It’s super family-friendly with the beach and the other activities offered there and could be a great place to base yourself for a week with plenty to climb and explore. On rest days you can explore the ruins, go hiking, swimming or take a boat for a little cruise around the area. In Olympos you also have a lot of nice Cafés and Restaurants where you can taste the local cuisine, which you really should =) If you like some partying, then that’s also possible there with live music et al! Olympos is also an host to a yearly climbing festival int he autumn, which would be good to check out if you’re in the area.</p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>I received the Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX over a year ago in November 2013. I climbed ice in Korouoma, Vaasa and <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/abisko-ice-climbing-festival-2014.html">Abisko</a> with them and was mountaineering in <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/07/arcteryx-alpine-academy-2014.html">Chamonix</a> and the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/mountaineering-and-climbing-in-the-polish-tatras.html">Polish Tatras</a>. All in all they have seen over four weeks of use and have been used for ice climbing, mountaineering and hiking.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14604399775" title="Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX &amp; Grivel Air-Tech crampons by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3863/14604399775_16e2e604d8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX &amp; Grivel Air-Tech crampons" /></a></p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>Similar to the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/04/scarpa-phantom-ultra-boots.html">Scarpa Rebel Ultra</a> the Rebel Ultra GTX is made for technical mountaineering, rock climbing and speed climbing on ice &amp; mixed terrain with snow. It can be used with a wide variety of crampons.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15888352111" title="Grivel G20 Crampons &amp; Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7528/15888352111_9a89f61bba_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Grivel G20 Crampons &amp; Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX" /></a></p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>Again Ueli Steck has helped to develop this boot, and you can see it from the weight and the technical features. While the sock-gaiter-construction isn’t new I have not seen a lot of mountaineering boots which use it. The Y-Structure, KCN-Tech fabric and Re-Active AC XT sole stand out on this booth, as does the very good fit &amp; the light weight.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15889704852" title="Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7473/15889704852_aecafa05ca_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX" /></a></p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>The shoe is hand made in Italy and is from a quality point of view absolutely superb. The fit is impeccable and even after four weeks of hard use the boots still look like new. Only the reflective tape in the back of the shoe shoes some wear, otherwise boot and sole still look like new.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14417800278" title="Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5078/14417800278_0203ed722c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX" /></a></p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>773 g per boot in Size 42,5 or 1.546 g for the pair. </p>

<h2 id="sustainability--recyclability">Sustainability &amp; Recyclability</h2>

<p>The boots are hand made in Italy. If you have worn it out you could have it resoled at your local shoemaker or you can recycle it via your local recycling scheme.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15270675413" title="Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX - Back by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7567/15270675413_b4b29d5fe3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX - Back" /></a></p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p><strong>Ice &amp; Mixed climbing</strong> I did with the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/04/grivel-g20-crampons.html">Grivel G20 crampons</a> to the boot and it’s a fantastic combination. The G20 are 424 g per crampon which means one shoe &amp; boot are 1197 g, which is about 150 g lighter than with the Phantom Ultra boots on. This might seem trivial but feels like a big difference. What I enjoy most with the Rebel Ultra GTX is, however, the freedom of movement my feet have in them. I can pretty much fully move my feet like I could in a trailrunner, with the difference that I can connect a pair of crampons to them and climb ice with them. This is especially useful for mixed climbing, but also on more tricky ice climbs in narrow places this freedom of movement helps in better foot placements. The high sock works like a gaiter &amp; keeps water and snow out and the carbon insert makes the sole nicely rigid for climbing. In short, the climbing in them is great, I really loved the freedom of movement they gave me. </p>

<p>The last winter was super mild and I wasn’t able to test the boots in severe cold weather, but the -5°C I used them in, often while standing around on snow and ice, where no problem for them and I had warm feet and toes in the boots. When constantly moving one might be able to wear them in even colder temperatures, say to -10°C, but beyond that I reckon they will be not warm enough and it’s better to put a warmer boot on. One option that I haven’t tried is using an overboot with them in colder weather for a little bit of extra insulation, though I almost think that just using a warmer boot would be lighter - though less versatile.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15864534166" title="Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX in Chamonix by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7496/15864534166_7c1da26c08_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX in Chamonix" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Hiking</strong> in these boots is possible but really wasn’t something I liked. While they allow great freedom of movement they are lined boots, so walking from the Chalet to the Cable Car in Chamonix, a 15 minutes walk, was not enjoyable as it was +35°C in the valley, which meant I had super-sweaty feet by the time I arrived at the house. In the Tatras I hiked on two occasions with the Rebel Ultra GTX boots, once in warm weather which again was not good, and once in the pouring rain, where they were fine. I had moist feet &amp; boots after hiking four hours in the rain in them, but they were warm so it was OK. They did also dry almost completely over night. However, when I know I need to hike long distances in the summer I would always take my <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/luna-sandals-oso.html">Luna Sandals OSO</a> along for it, as I much prefer to hike in warm weather in them.</p>

<p><strong>Mountaineering</strong> in the Alps and Tatras I did most of the time with the <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/grivel-air-tech-new-matic-steigeisen/?pid=81">Grivel Air Tech New-Matic</a> (453 g per crampon) but I also tried the <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/camp-xlc-390-steigeisen/">CAMP XLC 390</a> (254 g incl. optional Antibot). The weight difference between these two crampons is almost 200 g so not trivial. I did climb more with the Grivel Air Tech New-Matics and do like them a lot, and these two crampons show that you can use the Rebel Ultra with either a plastic harness or a front bale. The light weight and freedom of movement of the boot of course are great for alpine climbs and the sole is sticky on rock and allows for precise foot placements. I still would switch to <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/06/scarpa-stix.html">climbing shoes</a> for more demanding/ technical climbs, but if it are easy routes you’re doing the Rebel Ultra GTX are more than capable. Add in good grip on snow &amp; ice and you have a very efficient mountaineering boot.</p>

<h2 id="competing-products">Competing Products</h2>

<p>The <a href="">Scarpa Phantom Ultra</a> is a warmer and heavier boot which might attract the same people who’re curious about the Rebel Ultra GTX. If we look at other brands the <a href="http://bit.ly/1xAiXwT">La Sportiva Trango Cube GTX</a> and the <a href="http://bit.ly/1AhNGww">La Sportiva Batura 2.0 GTX</a> are both lightweight mountaineering boots which can be used for the same activities as the Rebel Ultra GTX.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15889670892" title="Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7471/15889670892_4fe3a5cbc6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX" /></a></p>

<h2 id="could-be-better">Could be better</h2>

<p>I’m hard-pressed to come up with something that could be better in this boot. I am sure Scarpa and Ueli had their reasons to use Gore-Tex® instead of OutDry® for this shoe, personally I feel OutDry® is slightly better at keeping moisture out, dries faster and breathes better, but I think the Gore-Tex® lining does a good job in this boot. So really nothing to complain.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15890337425" title="Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX with Grivel G20 Crampons attached by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7497/15890337425_9735b0f75f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX with Grivel G20 Crampons attached" /></a></p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>The Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX is a beautiful <em>and</em> ultralight mountaineering boot that is excellent for early and late season ice &amp; mixed climbing and summer mountaineering. It keeps your feet &amp; toes warm till at least -5°C even if you’re just standing around in the snow or hang in the belay, and with the Vibram® sole it is also well suited for easy alpine climbs. I think if you look to up your ice, mixed and alpine climbing by shedding weight and going lighter the Rebel Ultra GTX is the right boot for you. I love my pair and am always happy to put them on, because I know a good day in the outdoors lies ahead of me with them on my feet.</p>

    <updated>2015-01-02T12:12:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://hikinginfinland.com/2015/01/alan-hinkes-8000-meters</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You’ve probably seen a trend in my <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/books/">book reviews</a> in the last years: They’ve been more and more about mountaineering and climbing. Why that is so I’ll explain at another time, but now I want to take you along and tell you about the latest book I have read, <em>8000 Metres - Climbing the World’s Highest Mountains by Alan Hinkes</em>. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15985413000" title="Alan Hinkes: 8000 Metres - Climbing the World&#x27;s highest Mountains by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8658/15985413000_e521caa7ac_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Alan Hinkes: 8000 Metres - Climbing the World&#x27;s highest Mountains" /></a></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>There’s 14 8.000 m peaks on this planet and Alan Hinkes is the first British Mountaineer to have successfully summited all fourteen of them. In his splendid coffee table book “<a href="http://www.cicerone.co.uk/product/detail.cfm/book/548/tab/detail/iid/1/show/description#.VKZk6cbvR_0">8000 Meters - Climbing the World’s highest Mountains</a>” he tells the stories and shares his fantastic photos with the reader. Its a chronological layout and after a Foreword, Preface and Introduction we start at Alan’s first 8.000 m summit, Shisha Pangma, which he climbed in 1987. </p>

<p>From that year one Alan has been almost every season in the Himalayas and Karakoram on a quest to climb 8.000 m peaks, even if climbing all 14 of them wasn’t something that he set out to from the start. His writing style is very enjoyable: Honest, down-to-earth and lacking hyperboles which easily could sneak itself in when writing about climbing the highest peaks on the planet. The thoughtful texts describe the experiences of climbing the high mountains, what kind of mental and physical difficulties one can face, from the waiting game in base camp while sitting out bad weather and passing frozen corpses high on the mountains to climbing difficulties and getting up and down these peaks.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15986690559" title="Alan Hinkes: 8000 Metres - Climbing the World&#x27;s highest Mountains by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7463/15986690559_90c9064a27_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Alan Hinkes: 8000 Metres - Climbing the World &#x27;s highest Mountains" /></a></p>

<p>Alan’s climbing Motto is <em>“No mountain is worth a life, coming back is a success and the summit is only a bonus”</em> and throughout the book he also highlights the importance to have enough power reserves for the descent. What happens if you don’t have these Alan has seen in his friends on some expeditions, which burned themselves out on the ascent and then had no energy left for the descent, which often is even more dangerous than going up. </p>

<p>In between chapers there are small anecdotes from Alan’s encounters with fellow mountaineers like Reinhold Messner and Jerzy Kukuczka or the Trek-Ins to base camps and local cuisine. These loosen up the already enjoyable peak stories. A real highlight for me are the fantastic photos Alan has shot during his ascents and from his travels to these two mountain ranges. The photos were shot before the rise of automatic digital cameras and so one needed to know how to adjust ISO, Aperture and Shutter Speed to get great results, and the photos in this book are proof that Alan knows his trade. I have spent a lot of time just browsing the photos, tracing the lines described in the texts to the summit, and enjoy the vast views which you can have when standing on the top of the world. </p>

<p><em>8000 Metres - Climbing the World’s highest Mountains</em> is a highly enjoyable book that shouldn’t be missing on your bookshelf if you like mountaineering, alpinism and are dreaming of the highest peaks of the planet. The honest &amp; evocative writing is on par with the superb images in the book, and if you ever hope to stand on top of a 8.000 m peak you will do well to read Alan’s book and follow his Motto!</p>

<p>Get the book at your local bookshop, directly from <a href="http://www.cicerone.co.uk/product/detail.cfm/book/548/title/8000-metres#.VKZejsbvR_0">Cicerone</a> or from <a href="http://amzn.to/1wIIMnr">Amazon.de</a>, <a href="http://amzn.to/1xzM7fy">Amazon.com</a> and <a href="http://amzn.to/1yehuvP">Amazon.co.uk</a>.</p>
