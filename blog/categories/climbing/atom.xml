    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Romania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Greece and Turkey are host to the 2014 Petzl RocTrip which this year takes the form of a road trip. Come and join this great event and hang out with the likes of <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/08/ueli-steck-interview.html">Ueli Steck</a>, Saïd Belhaj, Dave Graham, Mélissa Le Nevé, Nina Caprez and many more while exploring the crazy good climbing that can be had in Eastern Europe!</p>

<p>The first time I became aware of the <a href="http://www.petzl-roctrip.com/en">Petzl RocTrip</a> was in 2011, when I saw some photos from the event in China. Then in 2012 the video of the event was published and it was mind-blowing. I still love to watch it, and if you have a moment watch it here.</p>

<iframe width="1280" height="720" src="http://hendrikmorkel.github.com//www.youtube.com/embed/EcU255XBlcI?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>In 2013 the Petzl RocTrip traveled to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QllWNEGBKic">Argentina</a> and it was equally inspiring. In 2013 it returned closer to home to the Gorges du Tarn, and now in 2014 the event is back and takes a new, unique format: A road trip across five countries in Eastern Europe. This is a great idea on so many levels, as it promotes what climbing is about in many ways: Travel to new crags, explore new countries, meet new people, climb new types of rock, experience different cultures. In a way it is promoting the dirtbag lifestyle, in a slightly more comfortable way! The teaser sets the mood well:</p>

<p>What is special about the RocTrip are the low costs for taking part in the event: It’s just 15€! Comparing that to the costs of some other events this is <em>very affordable</em>. It’s well organized (<a href="http://www.petzl-roctrip.com/en/practical-information">check the practical information</a>) and you get the opportunity to climb in some unique locations with members of the <a href="http://www.petzl-roctrip.com/en/news/spend-time-your-favorite-athletes-during-2014-petzl-roctrip">Petzl Pro Team</a>. </p>

<p>Interested? Then <a href="http://www.petzl-roctrip.com/en/join-us">pre-register until August 31th, 2014</a> to one (or all!) of the camps you would like to join. <a href="http://www.petzl-roctrip.com/en/practical-information#Transport">Organize your transportation</a>, for example join the carpool or get a ride in the Petzl bus. Book your flights (I’m flying to Antalya which is a smooth connection if flying from Helsinki, Stockholm or Oslo). Then start your <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/06/gimme-kraft.html">climbing training</a> so you’re fit for the hundreds of routes which will be waiting for you! The Petzl Roctrip website has a lot more information available, so check it out, pick the locations you want to join and pre-register! </p>

<p>I will be joining the Roctrip on the last two stops in <a href="http://www.petzl-roctrip.com/en/base-camp/geyikbayiri-turkish-style-columns">Geyikbayiri</a> and <a href="http://www.petzl-roctrip.com/en/base-camp/olympos-climb-sky-fall-water">Olympos</a> and you’ll be able to read about it here and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hikinginfinland">Facebook</a>. But I really hope to meet some of you in Turkey =)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Climbing is fun, and it’s even more fun to have your children along. In this article I share some thoughts on climbing with litte kids &amp; highlight some kids climbing gear that has worked well for us.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14863252951" title="Kids Climbing by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3865/14863252951_76a691f99f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Kids Climbing" /></a></p>

<p>Our son always has climbed: First on chairs and the sofa, up stairs and even on top of the table when no-one was looking. Taking him along to the climbing gym and outside bouldering and rock climbing, he quickly also wanted to climb like dad. As normal shoes are fairly inadequate for climbing and I want to encourage him to climb &amp; have fun, I did quite a bit on research on kids climbing gear: Interviewing friends who go climbing with their little ones, comparing at online shops and reading the handful of reviews on blogs. So that you have an easier time picking good gear for your little one to come along and climb safely &amp; have fun, here’s our gear recommendations.</p>

<h2 id="shoes">Shoes</h2>

<p>As children grow fast almost all <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/kletterschuhe/fuer--kinder/">kids climbing shoes</a> are available in adjustable sizes. It hurts in the wallet if you need to buy a new pair each four to six months and at a regular price of around 50€ <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/kletterschuhe-kinder/">climbing shoes for kids</a> ain’t cheap. We bought the <a href="http://bit.ly/1A2essj">Climb X Monkey</a> in EU Size 29 (16 cm inside length). The Monkey print on them is a nice touch for kids, and parents will appreciate the large Velcro closure which makes it super easy to put on. In the heel there is a 2nd Velcro strap which lets you adjust the size. It has a flat, grippy rubber sole, a rubber toe bumper and the rubber goes up in the heel, too - ideal for heel hooks. The toe box is wide if I compare them to my shoes so you won’t damage your kids feet. The rubber sole is thick but still lets the little ones climb very precise - I’m often surprised by how well he can stand on narrow ledges with the shoes. </p>

<p>I usually buy his shoes a number larger and adjust the size then via the Velcro strap, that way we get more usage out of them. As it’s now summer sale in most shops it’s a good decision to check out what they have on offer - at least at <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/kletterschuhe/fuer--kinder/">Bergfreunde</a> all kids climbing shoes are almost 15 or more % reduced in price right now, so a good opportunity to pick up a pair. If you only go bouldering then a pair of shoes is pretty much all you’ll need for the start, but if you also do a lot of rock climbing you also might want to pick up a kids harness.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14864052894" title="Climb X Monkey Kids climbing shoe by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5568/14864052894_5cfb04c66a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Climb X Monkey Kids climbing shoe" /></a></p>

<h2 id="harness">Harness</h2>

<p>Our son started climbing before he was two years old and since then has been climbing indoors &amp; outdoors and often comes along bouldering with me. As I really like rock climbing I decided to buy him a <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/klettergurte/fuer--kinder/">Kids harness</a> so he can come along to the gym and crag once and a while. After some research I quickly settled on the <a href="http://bit.ly/1h4WCge">Edelrid Fraggle</a> - it’s a full-body harness, affordable and easy to use. We use the XXS Size since January 2014 and I expect we’ll get another year or one and half out of this harness. The XXS size goes from a Torso length of 50 to 70 cm and the leg loops go till 37 cm in diameter and can carry a child up to 40 kg. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://bit.ly/1olaR65">Edelrid Fraggle</a> is easy to put on: Two leg loops and two arm loops with two buckles to adjust the size - one in the front, one on the backside. A Buckle closes the harness below the tie-in loop. It’s padded &amp; comfy and my son wears it often the whole time we’re at the crag until we go home. What’s special about it is that in the back it has a 2nd loop, which is ideal for kids that already can climb on their own but are too light and tend to get stuck when you lower them. In this back loop you can tie in a 2nd rope, wicht which you can gently pull the child down when it is stuck again. If your child is already a bit older and can already sit upright in a harness by itself then a normal harness like the <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/edelrid-finn-kinderklettergurt/">Edelrid Finn</a> would be a good solution. For more safety you can add the <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/edelrid-kermit-brustgurt/">Edelrid Kermit Chest Harness</a> which is compatible with any (normal) harness. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14679865078" title="Edelrid Fraggle - Back by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5571/14679865078_e58cf79c49_b.jpg" width="1024" height="681" alt="Edelrid Fraggle - Back" /></a></p>

<h2 id="helmet">Helmet</h2>

<p>There are dedicated kids climbing helmets, like the <a href="http://bit.ly/1A2eFM4">Petzl Picchu</a>. While safety is of the utmost importance for us if we go climbing with our son we thus far have used my <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/petzl-sirocco-helmet.html">Petzl Sirocco</a> for my son as with a thin beanie underneath it can be cinched down to a good fit for him. When he will be older &amp; we’ll be more regularly rock climbing he will get his own helmet (maybe the new <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/07/outdoor-news-2014-day-1.html">Edelrid Kids helmet</a>) but for now we use the Sirocco. If you’re child already has a bicycle helmet, that’d be an option that could work in a pinch, too.</p>

<h2 id="clothes">Clothes</h2>

<p>Clothes for climbing should be durable and give freedom of movement. It’s astounding how fast kids learn just by seeing what mom and dad do: We once were bouldering and I heel hooked, and the next time it was my sons turn to climb he started to also heel hook - without me having told him so! It’s a case of monkey see, monkey do =) So pants and shirts should not inhibite movement and should be robust: The little ones will often lean against the rock to take a break or slide down on it, so unless you want to buy new clothes after each climbing trip it’s well worth it to buy durable garments that have reinforcements in the seat and knees.</p>

<p>We like <a href="http://www.isbjornofsweden.com/">Isbjörn of Sweden</a> and so does our son, too. The <a href="http://www.isbjornofsweden.com/en/articles/2.13.841/trapper-pant-cordura">Trapper Pant Cordura</a> has the afore-mentined reinfocements in the knee and seat area, made of Cordura these pants take any abuse my son throws at them. To keep mosquitos and UV rays at bay he wears the very cool <a href="http://www.isbjornofsweden.com/en/articles/2.13.1339/mountain-longsleeve">MOUNTAIN Longsleeve</a> which has a topographic print of the Kebnekaise on it. Made from Tencel it’s soft on the skin and his favourite piece to wear when we go outdoors. If there’s a chance of rain then the <a href="http://www.isbjornofsweden.com/en/articles/2.16.776/light-weight-jacket">Light Weight Jacket</a> comes into the <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/fjaellraeven-kanken-mini-daypack/">backpack</a>. Made from a wind- and waterproof fabric with a high collar and removable hood, it’s a nice jacket that keeps him dry &amp; warm in bad weather. Finally, to keep the ears warm and make the helmet fit better we have the soft merino wool <a href="http://www.isbjornofsweden.com/en/articles/2.18.878/beanie-extended">Isbjörn Beanie</a> along. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14680213960" title="Isbjörn of Sweden Kids clothing by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5562/14680213960_fab69a0d94_b.jpg" width="1024" height="760" alt="Isbjörn of Sweden Kids clothing" /></a></p>

<h2 id="good-mood-snacks-and-toys">Good mood, snacks and toys</h2>

<p>Probably most important when we go to the crag is that there’s a good atmosphere and setting no objectives &amp; high expectations. When my son doesn’t want to climb but rather play with his toys or eat some fruit - that’s a decision I happily accept. Forcing kids likely will result in the opposite so he only climbs when he likes to do it. So one, two toys and snacks (We carry apples, water melon, sandwiches and nuts along &amp; go pick raspberries &amp; blueberries where available) are important to have along so he can be entertained. Often he likes to sit and watch what mom &amp; dad are doing and cheers us on. A couple more things are important to have along:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A full <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/marken/klean-kanteen/">water bottle</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/mawaii/">Sunscreen</a></li>
  <li>A sun hat</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/julbo-looping-ii-spectron-4-baby-sonnenbrille/">Sunglasses</a></li>
  <li>The rain jacket in case the weather turns</li>
  <li>Something comfy to sit on (I use some segments of a <a href="http://bit.ly/1yguVGx">ZLite</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The last time we were at the crag I walked up to the top of the cliff with my son and we wanted to try to rappel down, so he can see how to “<em>walk down</em>”. We were almost over the lip as I realized that he didn’t seem to like it, so we made the two steps back up to the cliff and saved the rappel experience for another time. I think as a parent it is important in these situations to be <strong>a)</strong> Aware if the little one is doing fine and <strong>b)</strong> If one’s owns plans are feasible &amp; safe. If either of these questions is answered with “No” it’s a smart solution to just walk back down.</p>

<p><strong>That’s it. A pair of shoes, a harness and helmet along with comfy clothes, snacks and some toys and you’re ready to take you daughter or son along for a safe, fun climbing trip =)</strong></p>

<p><em>Here’s the small print: Climbing is dangerous and as a responsible adult you should know what you’re doing. Don’t do dangerous stuff when the health of your child is at risk, don’t force them to do things, and most of all, have fun. You’re a hero for them already, no matter if you manage to top out or not. Be wise &amp; be a good example.</em></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lacking <em>Kraft</em> to do your project or carry your UH pack? Then <a href="http://gimmekraft.com/">Gimme Kraft</a> is the book that helps you develop the power you need to send your next problem.</p>

<p><img style="max-width:100%" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3890/14385371581_1329c62e2d_b.jpg#tl-532816872920317954;1043138249" class="alwaysThinglink" /><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="http://hendrikmorkel.github.com//cdn.thinglink.me/jse/embed.js"></script></p>

<p><em>Kraft, die [kraft]: Vermögen, Fähigkeit zu wirken; [körperliche oder geistige] Stärke</em> / <em>Kraft is German for power, force, strength</em></p>

<p><strong>It’s not about power, it’s about technique</strong> was my bouldering teachers opening line to our group of eager students. And seeing him - a thin and tall guy - climb several rounds upside down in our boulder cave, it’s easy to agree. We went on to learn proper boulder technique, first indoors, then took it to the rocks of Vaasa. But of course some Kraft does help, especially if you already have a good technique. However, Kraft does not magically appear from going climbing - that much I have learned in the three odd years since I have rekindled my passion for the art. Kraft comes from training. Being dedicated in developing a training routine, sticking to it and mixing it up as needed, that’s what this fine book from one of Germany’s best climbing gyms, <a href="http://cafekraft.de/">Café Kraft</a> helps you do. </p>

<p>When you pick up the book you realize that here people were writing who know what they’re talking about. The authors have worked with athletes like Alex Megos, Mayan Smith-Gobat, Stefan Glowacz, Sasha DiGiulian and many more, and have sat down to write this fine training book. It’s bi-lingual in English and Deutsch and comes with a DVD where the exercises can be viewed, as well as extra footage of Wolfgang Güllich training. The book starts out with an introduction to effective climbing training - you get a password to download the full 16 page introduction pdf online - and then sets out with dozens of exercises. The exercises are divided into different categories, like the Bouldering Wall, Pull-Ups, Rings, Floor &amp; Minibars, amongst others.</p>

<p><img style="max-width:100%" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2908/14202091729_e331c948dd_b.jpg#tl-532816872635105282;1043138249" class="alwaysThinglink" /><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="http://hendrikmorkel.github.com//cdn.thinglink.me/jse/embed.js"></script></p>

<p>This really being the first time I set out to train (apart from many years of Kenjutsu) I adhered to the books tips to do most of my training as climbing. In the Bouldering Wall chapter there’s several good exercises which not just train you, but also help you to improve your technique. At home I do the floor exercises and train on the two <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/metolius-rock-rings-3d-trainingsgriffe/">Metolius Rock Rings</a>, though I will need to switch the exercises up soon (the book recommends you change up your training routine at the latest every six weeks as otherwise you’re stagnating). I definitely have seen an increase in power, stamina and also feel like I climb better since I started to work out, and as the book is small and light I also usually carry it along to the boulders to see if there’s a new exercise I could try. </p>

<p>One critic I have about the book it’s that they put the video instructions on a DVD. Living in a household without TV (and DVD Player) and also all our computers being without DVD Drives, I have no opportunity to watch the videos. I’d rather would have seen the videos being available online to stream or download, which makes a lot more sense than a DVD. </p>

<p>Other than that this book really is great, and not just for climbers - though they obviously will benefit the most from reading it and doing the exercises. If you’d like to get more Kraft, get this book, make a personal training plan, stick to it, and see how your climbing and power will improve. Then take it out to the rocks and send your project!</p>

<p>You can order the book online at <a href="http://cafekraft.de/laden/produkte/GK">Café Kraft</a> and <a href="http://shop.boulderkeskus.com/fi/kauppa/muut/kirjallisuus/gimmekraft.html">Boulderkeskus</a> and with some luck buy it at your local climbing gym. </p>

    <id>http://hendrikmorkel.github.com/2014/06/scarpa-stix</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Climbing shoes. Like other <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/shoes/">shoes</a> they can be a source of much discussion. The <a href="http://www.scarpa.net/en/stix.html">Scarpa Stix</a> was popular long before I started climbing, was shelved and now makes a return - and it’s easy to feel when climbing with it why this shoe was and is so popular.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14359890633" title="Scarpa Stix by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3857/14359890633_7b1bf6b62b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Scarpa Stix" /></a></p>

<p>I like Scarpa’s climbing shoes. The <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2011/08/ultralight-climbing.html">Feroce</a> still gets regularly used on rock and plastic, though since I got the Stix late in 2013 it has been my climbing shoe of choice. There’s much to like about the shoe: There’s the weight of just 402 g for the pair in Size 41, the sticky rubber and the precise feel. One thing which really rules for me is that they’re quick and easy to put on and take off. With the Feroce I had three Velcro straps to open and close and the <a href="http://www.scarpa.net/en/techno-x.html">Techno X</a> uses laces. The Stix uses neither - it’s a slipper that hugs my foot for a wonderful snug fit without being constricting or uncomfortable. In case you’re wondering if it easy to lose the shoe - for example when heel or toe hooking: Nope, no chance. The Stix fits like a glove and doesn’t budge.</p>

<p>Much of that superb fit can be attributed to Heinz Mariacher who designed the Stix - a name very closely connected to high-quality climbing shoes. And this shoe does pack a few high-quality features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <em>Vibram® XS Grip 2</em> sole gives grip on rock and plastic alike</li>
  <li>The <em>X-Tension Randing</em> cradles your foot and heel to enhance your toe power</li>
  <li><em>REB - Reinforced Elastic Band</em> are the blue stripes on top of the shoe which improve the fit of the shoe</li>
  <li>Superb craftsmanship and construction</li>
</ul>

<p>But back to fit for a moment. Once you slip into the shoe, which is easy thanks to the two large tabs at the back and the one on the instep, your large toe right away finds its spot, with the other toes falling in line. While the rubber isn’t super thin, it’s thin enough for a precise feeling of the rock underneath: With the pointy toe box you’ll find pockets without problems, while on tiny ledges you feel like you can reliably and safely weigh down on your foot and know that it will stick. If you prefer slabs (and I really do!) or the climb just has no footholds you will be glad to hear that it’s a fine shoe for smearing. </p>

<p>Which brings us to toe and heel hooking. I like Scarpa shoes because they fit me so well - it sometimes feels like they were designed for my feet - and the heel cup on the Stix is no difference here. A narrow, hugging heel cup without any dead space makes it easy to do precise heel hooks, with sticky rubber going far up the heel on all sides for extra friction. Toe hooks are similar: Because of the great fit for all my toes and the rubber on top it’s comfy &amp; easy to hook with the shoe. As it’s fast to put on &amp; off it’s easy to take the shoes off between pitches or when taking a break from a boulder problem. Even on hot, sunny days the shoe is comfortable to wear and does not create hot spots or overly sweaty feet. </p>

<p>The Stix is reasonably priced for such a high-quality shoe, and using it now since five months a couple of times a week on rock and plastic it feels like they still have a lot of climbing left in them. If you’re in the market for new climbing shoes and Scarpa’s shoes fit your feet well, I’d highly encourage you to try the Stix if you’re bouldering and sports climbing. It’s a highly comfortable shoe which is lightweight with great sensitivity and support that offers grip on narrow ledges, tiny pockets and lets you walk up steep slabs in comfort.</p>
