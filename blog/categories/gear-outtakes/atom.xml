<p>The <a href="http://www.outdoorresearch.com/en/mens/jackets/mens-enchainment-jacket.html">Enchainment Jacket</a> has been my jacket of choice on the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/01/koli-national-park.html">UL Summit 2013</a> and many hikes before and after. It’s a very water-resistant softshell that can withstand the abuse of carrying a backpack, scrambling up hills and bushwhacking through dense undergrowth. Schoeller NanoSphere panels on the sides add breathability &amp; freedom of movement while the softshell fabric that’s used in the sleeves and torso keep the wind &amp; rain outside and me toasty on the inside - but not too hot &amp; neither too cold. The pockets are a tad small to take in a standard map but carry gloves &amp; beanie without problems while the triple adjustable hood ensure clear views also in a downpour. / 469 g in Size S. </p>

<h2 id="jung-emil-pants">JUNG emil pants</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16321423546" title="JUNG emil pants by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7466/16321423546_af7526b321_b.jpg" width="885" height="1024" alt="JUNG emil pants" /></a></p>

<p>★★★★
<br />105€, available at <a href="http://www.jung-ware.de/produkte/herren/hosen/306/emil-gruen?c=5">JUNG</a>, <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/jung-emil-bio-boulderhose/">Bergfreunde</a> and <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/jung-emil-kletterhose-gruen-m/">Bergzeit</a></p>

<p>And the prize of the comfiest climbing pants of 2014 goes to: <a href="http://www.jung-ware.de/">JUNG</a>! The emil from JUNG is not just super comfortable and stylish, nope, it is Designed in Cologne, sewn in Poland from <em>Global Organic Textile Standard</em> certified organic cotton and comes in very limited runs. I love the stretchy waistband which is so comfortable you might think you’re naked, it’s a revelation. The deep pockets securely hold everyday items in them while the adjustable trouser legs are ideal for climbing and bouldering. This was the only pants I wore on the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2015/01/petzl-roctrip-2014-turkey.html">Petzl RocTrip</a> and despite six intense days of climbing &amp; travelling it still looked the deal for the last Party on Saturday night. JUNG designs some super nice <a href="http://www.jung-ware.de/produkte/damen/hosen/">climbing trousers for women</a> and <a href="http://www.jung-ware.de/produkte/herren/hosen/">men</a>, so if you’re in the market for one - check them out! / 413 g in Size XS.</p>

<h2 id="adidas-terrex-solo">adidas Terrex Solo</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16321427016" title="adidas Terrex Solo Stealth approach 395 by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7546/16321427016_ae0bc5cf5b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="adidas Terrex Solo Stealth approach 395" /></a></p>

<p>★★★☆
<br />130€, available at <a href="http://bit.ly/1wsd91v">Backcountry.com</a>, <a href="http://www.bergzeit.co.uk/adidas-black-uk6-5/">Bergzeit.co.uk</a>, <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/adidas-terrex-solo-approachschuhe/">Bergfreunde.de</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/1zDfoq6">CampSaver.com</a></p>

<p>At 802 g for the adidas Terrex Solo pair in Size 41 1/3 the shoes are reasonably light. What makes this shoe special for me is the Stealth Rubber sole, which is the same rubber Five Ten uses in their climbing shoes. And as this is an approach shoe it makes sense that this shoe has such a grippy sole, because it means you can leave your climbing shoes longer in your pack. And if you’re out for Via Ferratas you’ll love these shoes, too - they give you grip on metal ladders and dry &amp; wet rocks alike. I wore these shoes on the Petzl RocTrip and my three week climbing road trip in Finland and look forward to using them again when the snow is gone. My only concern is the durabilty - because of the super-sticky sole the rubber is already starting to leave in the toe area, and I am curious to see how long they will last.</p>

<h2 id="primus-lite">Primus Lite+</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16347372575" title="Primus Lite+ by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8585/16347372575_cee03e283f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Primus Lite+" /></a></p>

<p>★★★☆
<br />130€, available at <a href="http://bit.ly/1EBsC5M">Backcountry.com</a>, <a href="http://www.bergzeit.co.uk/primus-eta-lite-gas-stove/">Bergzeit.co.uk</a>, <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/primus-eta-lite-sturmkocher/">Bergfreunde.de</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/1zDdkON">CampSaver.com</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/1CJVdEs">REI.com</a></p>

<p>The Primus Lite+ was our stove of choice on the High Coast Trail in Sweden. It boiled up to 600 ml of water in less than five minutes and was efficient in gas use. A 100 g cartridge fits inside which makes this a very compact and light system indeed: It is 399 g for pot with sleeve &amp; lid and the stove. The stove has a piezo ignition which means you don’t need to bring a firesteel or lighter along, and the new connection between pot and stove is easy and efficient. The sleeve ensure you can hold the pot with boiling water without problems, and you can put the handle over the top and then hang the whole set. And if you’re wondering, because of ™ issues Primus has renamed the EtaLite to Lite+ in 2015. <strong>Expect a more detailed review &amp; video about the Lite+ later this year.</strong></p>

<h2 id="foldacup">Foldacup</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16161501017" title="Foldacup by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8631/16161501017_a7b16dd596_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Foldacup" /></a></p>

<p>★★☆☆
<br />3€, available at <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/wildo-fold-a-cup-falttasse/">Bergfreunde.de</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/15l2nE5">CampSaver.com</a>.</p>

<p>A 25 g cup that packs small - that’s the Foldacup. I found mine on the trail two years ago and have been increasingly taking this one along instead of my Kuksa. The big plus for me is that it packs smaller and is lighter but just as easy to use for scooping water and drinking. It’s orange two - which makes it easier to find in my pack =)</p>

<h2 id="swiss-advance-crono-pocket-knife-tool">Swiss Advance Crono Pocket Knife Tool</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16321439846" title="Swiss Advance Crono Pocket Knife Tool by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7529/16321439846_762fb10e11_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Swiss Advance Crono Pocket Knife Tool" /></a></p>

<p>★★☆☆
<br />45€, available at <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/swiss-advance-taschenmesser/">Bergfreunde.de</a> and <a href="http://www.swiss-advance.com/produkt/pocket-knife?lang=en">Swiss Advance</a></p>

<p>The Swiss Advance Crono Pocket Knife Tool is so light and small that I forgot to take it out of my backpack when flying from Zürich home to Helsinki. The big surprise was that the Swiss security people had no problem with me taking this little Multittol inside of the plane - their only concern was that the bottle opener might not be durable enough, something that I can dismiss after opening plenty of beers with it. This little tool packs thirteen other tools, from a handy knife to a screw driver and awl. It’s a nifty little gadget but if you just need a knife then there are lighter options available. / 38 g</p>

<h2 id="outdoor-research-womens-helium-ii-jacket">Outdoor Research Women’s Helium II Jacket</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16161207239" title="Outdoor Research Women&#x27;s Helium II Jacket by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7553/16161207239_024b200afa_b.jpg" width="1024" height="786" alt="Outdoor Research Women&#x27;s Helium II Jacket" /></a></p>

<p>★★★☆
<br />160€ , available at <a href="http://bit.ly/1zCmcV1">Backcountry.com</a>, <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/outdoor-research-helium-ii-jacket-hardshelljacke/">Bergfreunde.de</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/1yXVmHc">CampSaver.com</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/1CrpuK6">REI.com</a> and <a href="http://www.outdoorresearch.com/en/womens/jackets/womens-helium-ii-jacket.html">Outdoor Research</a></p>

<p>This very lightweight jacket packs small in its own chest pocket when not needed and weighs a scant 159 g in Size M. It is waterproof though after an hour in heavy rain it leaked a bit, but for a spring or summer shower that shouldn’t be a problem at all. And it works as a great windjacket, too. My wife really liked the stylish look with the coloured zippers making it stand out, and it was simple in use but doesn’t lack anything - the sleeves that are tight from the wrists with no adjustments needed. It’s a womanly fit that’s not too loose but you can fit two layers comfortably under it (probably even three if the third one is a top). </p>

<h2 id="outdoor-research-womens-flyway-zip-hoody">Outdoor Research Women’s Flyway Zip Hoody</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15724959794" title="Outdoor Research Women&#x27;s Flyway Zip Hoody by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7563/15724959794_6e6d641421_b.jpg" width="1024" height="849" alt="Outdoor Research Women&#x27;s Flyway Zip Hoody" /></a></p>

<br />80€ , available at <a href="http://bit.ly/1AXPmJm">Backcountry.com</a>, <a href="http://www.bergzeit.co.uk/outdoor-research-flyway-w-039-s-tank-orchid/?pid=81">Bergzeit.co.uk</a>, <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/outdoor-research-womens-flyway-tank-top/">Bergfreunde.de</a>, and <a href="http://www.outdoorresearch.com/en/catalog/product/view/id/41026/category/4472/">Outdoor Research</a></p>

<p>The Women’s Flyway Zip Hoody is a versatile shirt that you can use for many different sports and also wear it in the city because of the neutral &amp; stylish look with the feminine fit. The fabric is neither too thick or too thin and feels smooth and light on the skin which makes it comfortable to wear. With 202 g in Size M it is light enough to use as a protector from the sun or as a layer, has a good breathability and it dries quickly. The hood and the long chest zipper help with venting while the thumbloops add a bit of warmth when its coller than expected. The small pocket stores keys, wallet and phone or a couple ot snacks when out running.</p>

<h2 id="patagonia-polarized-tee">Patagonia Polarized Tee</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16161485307" title="Patagonia Polarized Tee by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7521/16161485307_92e8164650_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Patagonia Polarized Tee" /></a></p>

<p>★★★☆
<br />50€, available at <a href="http://bit.ly/1ClOhz6">Patagonia</a>, <a href="http://www.bergzeit.co.uk/patagonia-polarized-graphic-boys-t-shirt-green-green-brg-1/">Bergzeit.co.uk</a>, <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/patagonia-boys-polarized-graphic-tee-t-shirt/">Bergfreunde.de</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/1GHzTpj">Backcountry.com</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/1upntHX">CampSaver.com</a></p>

<p>I bought the Patagonia Polarized Tee at the start of spring 2014 because I wanted a shirt that can be worn in the water (for packrafting and DWS) and on land, with a good UPF protection. The Polarized Tee fitted the bill, came in one of my current favoutite <em>colours</em> and also had a nice print on it (my son loves the print, too)! I can wear it for several days before it starts to develop a bit of a smell, then it just goes to the washing machine and is ready for another adventure. It ain’t as light as other <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/05/lightweight-hiking-shirts.html">hiking shirts</a> at 159 g in Size S, but it’s still light enough to not bother me. </p>

<h2 id="bern-brentwood-helmet">Bern Brentwood Helmet</h2>

<p>★★★☆
<br />80€, available at <a href="http://pelagobicycles.com/accessories/helmets/bern-brentwood.html">Pelago Bicycles</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/1EAujQS">Backcountry.com</a></p>

<p>Wear a helmet, they say. But only a <a href="http://bernunlimited.com/shop/bike/men/brentwood-451.html">Bern Brentwood</a>, I say. Because if you already are bullied by the car industry in wearing this accessory, let it at least look cool. And with the visor it not just looks cool, it also keeps the sun and rain out of your eyes. The eleven ventilation openings ensure that I don’t overheat with the Brentwood on my skull, and in winter you even can add some warmer linings. And of course you can look down on the non-helmet wearing cyclists when you stop next to them at the stop light and get plus points when the police stops you for speeding. / 428 g in Size L </p>

<h2 id="knog-boomer-usb-front--back">Knog Boomer USB Front &amp; Back</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15727436273" title="Knog Boomer by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8600/15727436273_ae3478c1a3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Knog Boomer" /></a></p>

<p>I have the impression that this autumn there was an increase of cyclists who have figured out that having front &amp; rear lights on your bike is a smart thing in traffic. Of course there are still the un-illuminated Ninjas who cycle in black garments and without lights through the eternal darkness of November, but it’s survival of the illuminated ones, you see. Since four years the Knog Boomer USB is on my handlebar and seatpost, but it’s equally easy to attach to a pram. The lights are bright - the white front Boomer subjectively is seen from a couple of hundred meters away, and in Blink mode in winter it is good to go for five days until it needs to go back to a USB port to be powered up again. The red one keeps the traffic from behind aware of you, which makes these my favourite bike lights for urban cycling and cycle-touring on roads. / 85 g for front &amp; rear light </p>

<h2 id="knog-ringmaster-12--lock-combo">Knog Ringmaster 1.2 &amp; Lock Combo</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16159798268" title="Knog Ringmaster 1.2 by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8577/16159798268_21d1cec74d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Knog Ringmaster 1.2" /></a></p>

<br />$31, available at <a href="http://amzn.to/1AYtH3O">Amazon.com</a> and <a href="http://amzn.to/1y7SXCA">Amazon.co.uk</a></p>

<p>Lock your bike, they say. Done, I say. With the <a href="http://euro.knog.com.au/bike/locks/cable-locks/ringmaster-1-2.html">Knog Ringmaster 1.2</a> &amp; Lock Combo my bikes have been safely connected to lamp posts, bicycle stands and other immovable objects since four years, and yet one has to been stolen. Sure, the safest way to secure your bike would be with a U-lock <em>AND</em> a Cable lock, which I’d do if I’d need to park my bike in Amsterdam and other cities were bicycle thieves are on the loose, but right now, here in Finland, the Ringmaster and Lock Combo has been plenty of security. The Ringmaster allows me to secure both wheels and frame to a immovable object, which is enough to scare off the opportunistic bicycle thief in this country. / 601 g for cable &amp; lock</p>

<h2 id="outdoor-research-lumen-liner-gloves">Outdoor Research Lumen Liner Gloves</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16347387085" title="Outdoor Research Lumen Liner Gloves by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8669/16347387085_2d4ec3d038_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Outdoor Research Lumen Liner Gloves" /></a></p>

<p>The Lumen Liner Gloves are super-thin Merino wool gloves and you really shouldn’t do any hard work with them. Because they’re sensitive. And will break. I found them even too sensitive to cycle or walk with a pram, which means mine went broken at the finger tips. I still used them on the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2015/01/hogakustenleden-the-high-coast-trail.html">Högakustenleden</a> last November where they were fine on the warmer days and when I needed dexterity and a bit of warmth, but they slowly are start to fall apart. It’s a shame as they’re warm and light. They’re no longer available, so you might want to look for the <a href="http://www.outdoorresearch.com/en/mens/gloves/mens-biosensor-liners.html">Biosensor Liners</a> if you need liner gloves. / 24 g for the pair in Size M.</p>

<p>I picked up a pair of Lodestar Gloves at the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/02/ispo-news-2014.html">ISPO 2014</a> and have had them along ice climbing in Korouoma, Höstvesi and Abisko, mountaineering in Chamonix and was skiing with them just last week. They’ve seen also a fair bit of hiking and cycling here, and every time again I was happy to have such warm gloves along. They have a Polartec Power Shield High Loft filling which keeps my fingers toasty warm, while the leather palm ensure good grip on ice tools, ropes &amp; belay device and the handlebar of my bike. When out ice climbing these are my dedicated belay gloves as they’re warm, have a lot of grip and allow for dexterity - an important thing when you are belaying your mate or rappelling. / 120 g for the pair in Size M.</p>

<p>Also two pieces of kit I was given at the ISPO last year and who have seen regular use since. Beanie and Tube are both made from 80% Merino wool and 20% Polyamide which makes them soft and durable. The Beanie fits well under my Bern Helmet and various jacket hoods and is functional &amp; cool at the same time, definitely a garment you can wear in winter to the office - same goes for the tube. The Flatlock seam  in green on the Tube is a nice detail and does not bother. I have worn both garments in all seasons last year, from spring till winter, and loved them - one of these <em>Pack them &amp; Forget them</em> items. / Tube 44 g, Beanie 42 g </p>

<p>A 137 g light down pullover (Size M). Between the 10X fabric is 900 cuin down and this sweet little pullover has been warm enough for summer adventures, when reaching the summit and there’s a small breeze, chilling at camp or taking a break between bouldering. It packs very small so easily fits in my backpack wherever I go, and is comfortable on the skin. While the material does feel filigrane it can take a bit of abuse, though I have used it strictly as a garment at camp/ resting/ when more warmth was needed. A long zipper helps with getting in and venting, there’s stretchy rims on the hem and cuffs and that’s about it. Really something for a SUL setup!</p>

<br />$9,95 for a 3-Pack of Note Books, $23,95 for the FN-19 Space Pen, available at <a href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com/colors/expedition/">Field Notes</a></p>

<p>I write it really down to remember it later. As I’m on over a dozen trips a year I sit down each evening at camp to write up how the day went. With the Expedition note books from Field Notes I can be sure that my notes will survive down pours and freezing cold temperatures. The FN-19 Space Pen packs small but is a real pen when in use, which I like. The ink won’t bleach, though it does have a bit of a tendency to smear when not 100% dry. / Pen 19 g, note book 30 g.</p>

<p>If it looks like it will get cool and wet on a spring, summer or autumn trip, the 331 g (Size S) light Nano-Puffy Hoody comes along, often even in conjunction with the PHD WaferLite Shirt. The Nano Puff Hoody is a classic piece and likely a staple in many outdoor mens &amp; womens wardrobe, and for a good reason. It’s a super warm hoody that keeps the wind outside and has a DWR finish that lets you wear it in a light drizzle. Even if it gets wet, it still keeps you warm. It packs in its own inside pocket. The hood keeps the ears and head warm. It looks nice. Yeps, with the Patagonia Nano-Puffy Hoody you’re warm &amp; well-dressed in the three warm seasons!</p>

<p>305 g in Size XS, the Houdini Thrill Twill Pants was along on lot of trips this year. The reason is simple: It’s a well-fitting pants with great freedom of movement. Hiking, scrambling, climbing, going to the pub or business meetings at the OutDoor, the Thrill Twill Pants does it all well while being comfortable. The biggest plus for me is probably that the size is so great, in XS I don’t need a belt and it fits perfectly. High heel hooks are no problem, and the pants dries fast when the get wet. Stretchy drawstring allow me to adjust the size of the trouser legs, very useful when climbing and wanting to see where that micro ledge for my next step is. A beautiful pair of trousers that’s durable and can be recycled at the end of its life.</p>

<p>I have been using fleece jackets again for several years, and the Haglöfs Triton II Hood, a full-zip fleece jacket with thumbloops &amp; a hood, has been a staple in my layering system since I got it last year. The hood can be worn under a helmet, be it a cycle helmet or my <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/petzl-sirocco-helmet.html">Petzl Sirocco</a>, while the thumbloops help on those first cool autumn days where I forgot to take a pair of gloves along for the bicycle ride. Three zippered pockets store stuff safely on the go, be it hiking, hill walking or climbing. It’s a comfy fleece jacket in a beautiful colour, and if I need a nice, cozy yet breathable midlayer or I’m cool in the mornings at home then the Triton II comes on. / 303 g in Size S.</p>

<p>The Norrøna bitihorn aero100 Jacket (104 g in Size M) accompanies me since autumn 2013 already and has been a joy to use. It’s lightweight and can be packed in its own chest pocket, which is ideal when travelling. While I occasionally missed a hood I managed to life without it. The Size M was a alright fit despite me being a Size S - I needed to pull the hem drawstring pretty tight for it being a good fit. The jacket stays well in place also when in a cycling position and the material is durable enough to carry heavy grocery backpacks or light backpacking rucksacks. As its always windy on the coast here, the bitihorn aero100 is often along to keep the cool wind at bay.</p>

<p>I’m not 100% happy with the Merrell AllOut Rush - the large drop is likely the reason for that. It’s not as minimal anymore as other shoes from Merrell and after wearing them for a while and switching into more minimalist shoes I realize how my stride has suffered. That said, if you’re new to the whole barefoot hiking &amp; walking movement you might find the AllOut Rush just perfect. It’s a nice shoe with good grip on many surfaces, from wet grass to muddy uphills. The toe box offers your toes plenty of space, and the heel cup also gives a good fit. / 556 g in Size 42.</p>

<p>It was about time that I replaced the 60 l stuff sack I used for transporting my ultralight backpacks when flying abroad for a hike: It already had a few holes at it and somehow always arrived open in Vaasa’s airport at the baggage claim. That no longer happens with the Arc’teryx Carrier Duffle 50: It stays closed and also the occasional downpours the duffle needs to endure when it’s loaded in to the plane are no problem anymore: The Carrier Duffle is highly water resistant. It is just 538 g heavy, which is in comparison with other duffles almost SUL! I can wear it backpack style or over the shoulder and at the airport the straps can be pulled tight and stored out of the way. At the top and bottom there is a haul loop and on each side there’s a handle - so you or the friendly airport employee can carry the duffle as it was intended. A superb piece of kit that goes along on every trip abroad.</p>

<p>Using chalk is pretty much essential when climbing, even more so when bouldering. <em>“Chalk up correctly”</em> was something I heard quite a few times during the last weeks climbing &amp; bouldering, and I was happy to have pharmaceutical grade Magnesium Carbonate chalk from Rock Technologies in my chalk bag. A chalk ball reduces air born chalk dust and so is more healthy - if you ever visited the <a href="http://www.boulderwelt.de/">Boulderwelt in München</a> you will wish everyone would use chalkballs! Anyway, the chalkballs are easy to use and it’s fast &amp; efficient for chalking up. The chalk is good and helps you to stick to slopers and prevents sweaty hands &amp; fingers for a good while. / 60 g</p>

<p>Also known as <em>Cheater Gloves</em> these 48 g light gloves allow you to climb cracks like Spiderman without ripping open your knuckles and the back of your hand. Also sweaty hands are no longer responsible for slipping in a crack. Sure, you could just tape up your hands and be tough when you go up a crack, but I find the Crack Gloves much better, really. Easy to use - the most difficult thing is figuring out your size - the gloves close with a Velcro strap and the outside is made of a sticky rubber which gives a lot of friction. The side that’s to the back of your hand has a cushioned mesh lining which makes sharp, sharp cracks slightly more bearable. If you’re starting to get into crack climbing - get a pair. They’re cheaper than all the tape you’re bound to wrap around your hands, and a lot better.</p>

<p>★★★☆
<br />34,95$, available at <a href="https://peakdesign.com/store/leash?coupon_code=hikeinfin">Peak Design</a></p>

<p>The 47 g light Peak Design Leash I bought earlier this year as I realized that my Dyneema cord ain’t the best solution to carry my camera (<a href="http://youtu.be/wHUFWUGWKS4?list=UU927vE_KkPy6pFJboaJ9Lig">as explained here</a>). I’ve been very happy with the Leash, it’s worlds more comfortable than the Dyneema string and easy to use, too. If it’s not needed or could get into the way I can quickly take it off, and the many varied possibilities the Leash can be used make it a really versatile camera strap. It’s also compatible the the Peak Design Strap and the new systems, which I’m considering trying out next.</p>

<p>★★★★
<br />1.800円, available at <a href="http://moonlight-gear.com/?pid=39819567">Moonlight Gear</a></p>

<p>A companion since well over a year, the Hariyama Productions coin case is a 4 g cuben wallet and all I need for carrying cash &amp; cards. It can get a bit tight when I have several business cards in there and need to carry cash, but in Finland I rarely need anything else than a Debit/ Credit Card either way so there’s no need to search for coins or bills. It has been water-resistant but after being daily pulled out of my pocket between a few times and a dozen times it look like I will need to get a new one. They come with differently coloured zippers and I think I will go for a orange one the next time! </p>
