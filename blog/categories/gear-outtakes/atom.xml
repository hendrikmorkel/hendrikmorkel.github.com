<p>I have reviewed the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/05/black-diamond-alpine-start-hoody.html">Alpine Start Hoody</a> before, but I felt that after another two years of intensive use it’s time to highlight once more how much I love this wind jacket. I use it almost daily, when out with the kids, cycling, and it is the first thing that I pack when I go hiking &amp; backpacking. After so many years it is not so water-resistant anymore (even when I clean it regularly with special detergents), but it still holds the wind out like a king. There’s a little hole in the left sleeve where I was bushwhacking, its a bit dirty at the cuffs from the almost daily use, but other than that I still love this jacket heaps and I’d be my first recommendation if someone is looking for a wind jacket/ softshell. / 204 g in Size M</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.arcteryx.com/product.aspx?language=EN&amp;gender=mens&amp;category=Shell_Jackets&amp;model=Alpha-FL-Jacket">Alpha FL Jacket</a> is an ultralight Gore-Tex Pro hardshell which is made for fast &amp; light alpinism, and hence is great also for ultralight backpacking. Sure, there are even lighter hardshells out there, but this is such a great fitting jacket for me that I don’t think I need to continue the hunt. It takes all the abuse I throw at it - from jamming myself into a crack in the rain to hiking through the undergrowth - which I like a lot. The sleeves are a wee bit longer and so keep the hands dry when gloves stayed at home, the one pocket is again useful for some small items like my <a href="http://amzn.to/28SNH4J">camera</a>, and if not needed it packs down to a volume of one litre and disappears in the pack. There’s noting superfluous on this jacket, it allows me all the crazy moves I could come up with and looks good - what else do you need from a hardshell? / 270 g in Size S</p>

<p>I have used the <a href="http://bit.ly/28OMBTX">Patagonia Nano-Air Hoody</a> now over a year, from hiking the IAT in Ireland over ski-touring to spring and summer hikes across the globe. It’s in combination with the Alpine Start Hoody currently my most worn insulation layer, though it’s really a breathable insulation layer as it is made from Patagonia’s FullRange material (think Polartec Alpha). It’s a super-stretchy piece, not wind-resistant but in combination with a wind jacket a great layering piece. I have been sceptical about breathable insulation materials, but after a week-long autumn hike in the rain and sleet of Sweden I was convinced. It’s great to have a piece on that keeps you warm when you stop and doesn’t heat up too much when you’re moving, especially in wet and cold weather. In warmer weather (anything over 10°C for me) it’s too warm, though, and I’ll shed it as soon as I start to feel too hot. It’s not too warm on its own either, but with a wind jacket or hardshell on top it’s a good insulation piece. With four pockets it’s also good for keeping stuff close by (snacks, camera batteries and a gas canister when you get closer to camp). The shell material is pretty sensitive, though, so bushwhacking in it will destroy it in no time, as will intense rock contact. / 352 g in Size S</p>

<p>The Arc’teryx Satoro AR Zip Neck LS isn’t available yet in the shops as it launches in the autumn. I was given one when I visited Arc’teryx in Vancouver for the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/12/arcteryx-procline-carbon-lite-ski-boot.html">Procline Ski Boot</a> and <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/12/arcteryx-voltair-avalanche-airbag.html">Voltair Airbag Launch</a>, and have used it ski-touring and hiking over the last six months. Made from Merino wool and a synthetic core it combines the benefits of the two materials. The baselayer has a great fit for me (as have all Arc’teryx pieces with an Athletic cut) and I like the feel of the material on the skin. It stays odour-neutral pretty long, five or six days is no problem. The little chest pocket is good for e.g. a camera battery and SD card, and the long front zipper is great to dump heat. The price is pretty steep, though. / 202 g in Size S</p>

<p>The from Coefficient Vest Black Diamond is not easily available anymore and that’s a sad thing in my opinion. For ages I have been a fan of vests, and this fleece vest is a really great layering piece in all seasons. Ski-touring in winter, hiking in spring and mountaineering &amp; backpacking in summer, the Coefficient Vest has been a faithful companion. The Powerdry fleece ist toasty warm and wicks sweat further away to the outside, and it’s pretty warm for its weight, too. It’s a slim-fit piece that’s slightly longer so especially good in winter. / 225 g in Size S</p>

<p>More of a urban outdoor piece for me is the <a href="https://www.norrona.com/en-GB/products/falketind/falketind-long-sleeve-shirt-m/">Norrøna falketind longsleeve</a>, a beautiful and super-comfortable longsleeve. Made of drirelease wool which is a mix of wool and Polyester it is soft on the skin, and the Polygiene finish ensures it stays odour-neutral for a while (two to three days in use, I’d say). It’s simply a pretty longsleeve that feels great to wear, and a basic for me when I’m on a business trip. / 162 g in Size S</p>

<p>The <a href="http://shop.eaglecreek.com/pack-it-specter/l/231">Pack-It Spectre Cubes</a> ensure everything stays orderly in my pack or <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/10/one-duffle-to-rule-them-all-the-arcteryx-carrier-duffle.html">duffle</a> when I travel. Especially If I travel only with my backpack I love to take one or two of these, as I can fit all I need in them, compress the content even further and at the hotel can just pull all my clothes out in one go. The Silynlon cubes are highly-water-resistant and their different shapes and sizes mean you can get the ones that suit you best. I have a compression cube and a smaller half cube in which I can fit garments for ten days without problems (they help in packing less, but I still tend to come home with one or two shirts I didn’t wear). A useful organizing tool if you don’t want that your underwear is seen by everyone if you get something out of your backpack! / 19 g for the Half Cube, 57 g for the large Compression Cube</p>

<p>I love climbing pants because they’re comfortable and allow for freedom of movement. And if they are as comfortable and cool-looking as the <a href="http://www.marmot.de/content/en/collection_28&amp;c=703">Marmot Mono Pant</a> you can’t go wrong really. The deep pockets are great for phone, wallet and keys and there’s also a brush pocket for when you’re working on your boulder project. Great for climbing and bouldering they also work very well in the city, and as my feel-good pants they have seen a lot of use during the last year. The material is breathable yet durable, and even super-hot summer days allow you to stay cool in these. The leg cuffs an be adjusted in width so you can see you’re foot placements, too. / 325 g in Size S</p>

<p>At the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/06/arcteryx-alpine-academy-chamonix-2015.html">Arc’teryx Academy in Chamonix</a> I got the <a href="http://www.arcteryx.com/product.aspx?language=EN&amp;gender=Mens&amp;category=Pants&amp;model=Gamma-Rock-Pant">Gamma Rock Pants</a> and immediately fell in love with them. They are light, durable, comfortable, water- and wind-resistant, have two zippered pockets, allow for great freedom of movement and even have an integrated belt. I have used this on pretty much every 3-season hike and climb in the last twelve months, from climbing and Via Ferratas in the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/08/love-the-dolomites-tour.html">Dolomites</a> to mountaineering in Macedonia last month and <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/06/impressions-from-the-bregenzerwald-in-vorarlberg-austria.html">hiking in Austria</a>.

If you roll the trouser leg up reflective details appear, and the material is water-resistant. A zippered side pocket ensures something important like your phone doesn’t drop out of your pocket. The two hand pockets also are good for all the other stuff you carry along. It’s a good looking pants that is at home in the city, but thanks to the bicycle cut it also is alright for medium-length rides around town.

<p>The BUFF really shouldn’t need an introduction I reckon. I got the <a href="http://www.buff.eu/es_es/anton-blue-ink.html">Anton Krupicka High UV Buff</a> as I like the print of the Flatirons on it, but with hundreds of prints you will find one that suits just your taste. These are the UL multi-use items: From it’s intended use as a piece of headwear you can convert it into a pot holder, water filter and towel. It’s a super useful item, and in these sunny summer months the High UV version keeps you from burning your head. / 39 g</p>

The Gobi II Hopewell from VIVOBAREFOOT are these shoes for me, and best of all: They are proper barefoot shoes, with a wide toe box, and medium to narrow heel, a grippy sole and they look the part. A lovely pair of shoes from the guys at VIVOBAREFOOT, sadly sold out at the moment, so if you see a pair somewhere try them on and see if they suit you. / 521 g for the pair in EU Size 42</p>

Well, I ran down muddy mountains in these and didn’t slip, sprinted over icy and snowy trails and walked up on rubble paths, always with great grip. The Speed Lacing is great (though I made the one shoe a wee bit too short almost) and also otherwise this trailrunning shoe with the low drop allows for a great feel on the trail. That’s thanks to the <em>Mountain-bike-inspired “tyres for your feet” design that’s directly moulded to the upper for added stability</em>. They’re great for hiking, too, if you’re into fast &amp; light shoes with great grip. / 567 g for the pair in EU Size 42</p>

<p>I have used the <a href="http://www.outdoorresearch.com/en/mens-seamseeker-gloves.html">Outdoor Research Seamseeker Gloves</a> for belaying and Via Ferrata hikes and have found them great in 3-season use. Especially on hot days in the Alps the open finger tips and breathable upper are comfortable and preferable in my opinion over a normal glove. The gel padding in the palm does run hot on long rappels, but otherwise they do their job well. Useful side effect: Hands get less dirty! / 98 g for the pair</p>

<p>I bought a pair Black Diamond Magnetron RockLock carabiners about three years ago, and both have seen constant use in that time. One is connected to my PAS (see underneath) and the other one is with my belay device. I like that they’re easy to operate in any season with one hand, with our without gloves, don’t freeze when ice climbing and are big and hence lie good in the hand. The gate opens wide for easy clipping, too. I have a bunch of HMS carabiners, but these two are my favourites for their ease of use. / 82 g</p>

<p>PAS stands for <strong>P</strong>ersonal <strong>A</strong>nchor <strong>S</strong>ysyem, and if you do Multi-pitch or alpine climbing then you probably know what this is. You clip into the stand (belay) with it, and the beauty of the <a href="http://www.metoliusclimbing.com/pas_personal_anchor_system.html">PAS from Metolius</a> is that the six loops all have a breaking load of 22 kN. The length is adjustable to your needs at the belay and can be long or short, and each loop having such a high breaking load means more security. It’s also light and stores compact when climbing, so for me a better system than a Daisychain or a 120 cm sling. / 76 g</p>

<p>The Furia from <a href="http://scarpa.it">Scarpa</a> is a climbing shoe for bouldering and sports climbing. I found the VIBRAM® XS Grip2 sole great for slabs and small holds alike, and friction climbing in them is a lot of fun. The toe is covered with rubber on top, too, which makes it great for toe hooks, and the heel is also covered in rubber for heel hooks. Inside it feels very comfortable and even in hot weather (25°C+ in Greece, for example) it remains comfortable. The two Velcro straps allow to adjust the shoe great to my foot, and the two straps in the back make it easy to pull the shoe on and off. It’s a more advanced shoe so beginners probably want a less aggressive shoe than this one, but if you’re climbing hard then this shoe is right for you and can help you to solve a hard boulder problem or succeed on a hard sports route. / 366 g for the Pair in Size 40 </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.grivel.com/products/rock/carabiners/25-mega_k6g">Twingate carabiners from Grivel</a> are awesome, a real innovation in the climbing carabiner market. Grivel thinks they’re just as safe a a screwlock carabiner, and I think I agree. Things must be pretty dire for something to open this in a situation, but they’re easy to use with one hand (without gloves) on the other hand. I use the one I have in different situations, and Grivel suggests you could use it from building a belay to clipping into one. It’s a tad heavy for alpine use, but works well on Multipitch climbs et al. / 76 g</p>

Made for small to medium faces they fit me very well. The mirrored glasses in red also are surprisingly scratch-resistant and they haven’t gotten a single one in the 9+ months I now have them in use. Developed as bicycle glasses they work equally well for skiing and hiking as well as strolling through town &amp; travelling. They’re pretty affordable, too, for such good shades. In some situations they do fog up a bit, but if I take them up it really just takes six seconds and they’re clear again. Great shades for just about any outdoor adventure. / 27 g </p>

<p>At 25€ the 500 ml Softflask is far from being a bargain. It’s also not particularly light in terms of weight-to-volume. But it’s easy and convenient to use - both for drinking as well when storing the empty bottle, as it takes up just a wee bit of space. If you need a light-ish softbottle give the Softflask a look and decide if you want one. / 30 g</p>

It also has the typical inov-8 rubber sole which gives great grip on soft, wet, hard and dry trails alike. The shoe is comfortable on the feet, pretty breathable and flexible, with good laces that keep the shoe in place and you running or hiking for many kilometres. The only drawback is as usually that the rubber doesn’t hold long on hard rock and asphalt, so keep them away - especially from the latter. A comfortable shoe which should make those with wide feet very happy. / 488 g in Size 43</p>

It’s an ultralight trailrunning and backpacking shirt that’s super breathable with its mesh construction. The flat seams don’t bother when running with a pack, and the shirt feels very soft on the skin. It dries fast after your run, be it on the body or hanging in the wind. The cut gives nice freedom of movement and the material is surprisingly immune to getting snagged when running through narrow trails.</p>

The shorts have five pockets and my main gripe about them is that they’re a bad size to keep the iPhone 5 reliably in place. There’s one large stretchy back pocket in the middle which is just a bit too big for the iPhone 5 so that it moves around in it and can drop out. The other four pockets - two more in the back and two mre in the front - are again just too small to hold the phone, but do a good job at storing gels and snacks. The large main pocket in the back can take a wind jacket for when the weather turns nasty. It has an inside mesh shorts which means you can leave your underwear at home, and the fit is superb - no chafing or pressure points with great freedom of movement. I also have been swimming in them, which works well though they need a bit longer to dry. A great running and backpacking shorts if you like to go light &amp; fast. / 122 g in Size S</p>

At first I was sceptical - do I really need another headlamp? But somehow the Tikka RXP has managed to silently convince me as it has sneaked awfully often into my pack and onto my head when more light in the dark was needed. The Tikka RXP has red and white light, and the latter makes use of Petzl’s Reactive Lightning technology where the lamp adjust its output according to what you’re doing; from a low, wide beam to check the map and work at camp to a powerful spot distance mode which lets you see far. The headlamp can be re-charged on the trail via a USB cable, so you can attach it to a power pack or solar charger when the battery indicator tells you it’s time to recharge. At 105 g it’s not the lightest headlamp available but for outdoor activities after dark where you need a lot of light I found the Tikka RXP a superb headlamp.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.primus.eu/spider-stove-set">Primus Spider Stove</a> arrived at the beginning of this year and I was a bit doubtful if I’d ever use it. Spring turned to summer and with it came family hikes and weekend trips with friends, and somehow the Spider Stove managed to get itself taken along to the forests and lakes to boil water for us. It’s a good stove or up to three people I figured out after a few trips, just boiling enough to re-hydrate three meals (á 300 ml each) or three cups of coffee. The windscreen has magnets at the bottom which the stove unit securely connects to, but it is heavy. What I find really annoying is that I can’t transport a big 230 g cartridge in the pot - a 100 g cartridge fits barely with the stove inside. Overall more of a camping/ day hikes/ easy backpacking stove for me than a stove for long backpacking trips, although for the aforementioned trips a slightly bigger pot would be desirable. / 562 g for pot, lid, stove and windscreen</p>

I was sceptical of the concept before trying them on, but need to say that I really like them. They’re not just stylish and comfortable when hiking to the crag, once you tie in and climb in them they remain comfortable. There’s two gear loops on the front for them so it’s best used for sports climbing, and a chalk bag attaches in the back. Four roomy pockets store phone, key and wallet on the go and an integrated mesh liner shorts means you don’t need to wear underwear in them. The harness does its job well and is comfy and distributes weight well when hanging in it. The tie-in point is pretty neat, too, and there’s a bit of an elastic “belt” to adjust the fit, thought I recommend you buy them in the right size. / 506 g in Size M</p>

<p>This year I have been doing quite a few Via Ferrata trips, and applying my ultralight principles to this activity was normal for me. The lightest available Via Ferrata Set on the market is the <a href="http://www.edelrid.de/sports/klettersteigsets/cable-ultralite-2-1-night-oasis.html">Cable Ultralite 2.1</a> from Edelrid. At just 302 g you get two comfortable and easy-to use Via Ferrata carabiners on differently long leashes, a shock absorber and a tie in point. The materials are all high-quality and durable. The carabiner lays comfortably in the hand and is easy to clip to the steel wire, though the differently long leashes mean you need to try to clip them always in the same order otherwise they tend to tangle up. I haven’t fallen on it yet so can’t comment on the shock absorber, but am positive that it too works good. Overall a great choice for a Via Ferrata Set if light weight is important.</p>

<p>The fjørå garments are made for riding down singletrack on your Mountain Bike, which makes it a damn fine line for bikepacking, too. The fjørå dri1 Pants are water and windproof while being reasonably breathable - a lot more so if you open up the thigh vents on each side. The one thigh pocket on the left leg stores phone and keys so you always track your rides &amp; runs on Strava, and the trouser legs can be adjusted a bit in width via a zipper and Velcro. In the seat and knees there are stretchy inserts which are great, and the silicone print on the waistband inside ensures the pants stay where they belong. The width can be adjusted via Velcro straps on the left and right. I’ve used them on warm summer mornings and cool spring evenings on my rides and found them a damn comfy pants. The legs are narrow enough so that I don’t get chain oil on them and the side vents ensure I don’t run too hot in them when the thermometer climbs above 20°C. / 208 g in Size S</p>

What’s special about this Polo shirt is that you can flip the collar up and then close it with two buttons, which is especially for cycling on windy days a superb invention. It’s a synthetic shirt which is a bit thicker so nice warm just under a jacket on a ride, but not too hot on warm days on it own. It does smell a wee bit after a long day of cycling, but that’s just inherit with the material. It does wick sweat quickly away and dries reasonably fast so you don’t have cold chills when standing around in it after you came down the singletrail. The small pocket is big enough for an iPhone 5 and your wallet. A fine Polo that I also wear on other occasions than cycling. / 184 g in Size S</p>

This water and windproof jacket has a nice long back to keep also the lower back protected when you’re leaning far down on your <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/11/pelago-bicycles-stavanger.html">race bike</a>, while the ventilation zips at the upper arm are directed a bit forward to catch your headwind and cool you down. The cuffs can be tight or open for more ventilation, and also the high collar can be cinched tight to let no wind in, though I have never felt a need for doing that. The one chest pocket is tiny and a iPhone 5 barely fits in there. The hem has two drawstring adjusters to ensure it stays put, and is one of the few jackets where it actually work. It’s my go-to cycling jacket in any weather, from windy &amp; sunny summer days to rainy spring morning, the fjørå dri1 Jacket is a favourite companion on bike rides. / 175 g in Size M</p>

<p>Yes, sometimes you need to wash all these fine garments presented here. As that is my job, I bought <a href="http://toko.ch/en/products/care-line/textile-care/eco-textile-wash">Toko Eco Wash Textile</a> to keep hiking, cycling, climbing and running shirts and trousers clean. One bottle is good for running six to ten machines, with about three to five garments per machine. The detergent is biodegradable and contains no dyes, optical bleaches, whiteners or phosphates. I wash baselayers (shirts like the Norrøna fjørå Polo and the Arc’teryx Sarix SS Shirt above), trousers and even jackets with this detergent, and they come out clean and with a neutral smell (I don’t like deodorized detergents). It can be used at low washing temperatures which is often the case with these synthetic garments, and allows you keep your expensive gear in shape for the next adventure. / 290 g for 250 ml</p>

With the Supernova Harness being a harness conceived by women, designed by women, and built for women I thought this will be the harness for her, and while she did like the lightweight and comfortable harness she isn’t as obsessed about climbing as me. M liked the padding and ease of adjustment of the harness, with a fully adjustable waist and leg loops, and the No-Twist belay loop came in handy when she was belaying me. / 360 g in Size M</p>

<p>Gloves, the eternal struggle. If all you need gloves for is that they keep your fingers warm and look good you’re a lucky person and won’t understand the “Search for the perfect glove” that outdoor enthusiasts, and especially ice climbers, conduct. The <a href="https://hestragloves.com/sport/intl/gloves/mountaineering/ergo-grip-outdry-dexterity-long-five-finger/100100/">Hestra Ergo Grip OutDry Dexterity Long</a> is as close to the perfect ice climbing and mountaineering glove I have come, me thinks. It is warm, waterproof with an OutDry membrane, offers superb dexterity and is very, very durable. I have used this fine glove for two winters now and some mountaineering and love it. It’s easy to clip ropes, open ‘biners, conduct fiddly work and keep warm fingers, even when water is running down the shaft of your ice tools. / 186 g for the Pair in Size 9</p>

<p>294 in that name stands for the 294 steel studs with carbide pins on these tires, which makes these <em>the</em> cycling tires for icy conditions - and thanks to the triple thaw + freeze cycles we had this “<em>winter</em>” (and the last one, too) the <a href="http://www.suomityres.com/eng/tyres/">Gazza Extreme</a> have been very, very useful. Suomi Tyres is a small company from Eastern Finland and they know how to make some of the best bicycle tires on the planet - they are since 90 years in this business. They’re the only bicycle tyre manufacturer in Northern Europe (check this <a href="https://youtu.be/lxYa4Lb3VRI?list=UUl1rmXRFLvoJlm4E8UirZVw">video of how the tires are made</a>) and produce since ten years already environmentally sound tires from pure rubber compounds. I have ridden the Gazza Extreme on my 29er in the last two winters and didn’t slip once with them on icy roads and frozen lakes. These tires are on the bike a good five to six months a year and so far have yet to lose one stud! / 1090 g per tyre</p>

<p>Back to boots! Well, not really, but for Nordic Skating and Backcountry XC Skiing the <a href="http://lundhags.se/">Lundhags</a> BC Guide Boots have been fantastic. The shoe was out of the box comfortable, in part probably thanks to the 3 mm wool felt liner boot which can be removed. The boot itself is made from a Perwanger split leather on top which has been great in shedding water and snow and keeping my feet dry, and a Certech 4.5 cellular rubber as a midlayer, with a Rottefella® BC sole underneath which allows you to click into NNN bindings - be these on skis or Nordic Skates is up to you! The laces are long but allowed me to fit the boot well to my feet, and the boot is well insulated against the cold from below so that your feet stay toasty when you’re out on the ice.

The colours and fit are spot on, sometimes I find the waistband folds over (for example when cycling or climbing) but overall these have been great.

I found it especially useful in winter when I need to wear my phone close to my body so it stays warm - the battery drains like nothing in the cold - but it can get wet from my sweat. The case has been 100% waterproof thus far and the transparent front lets me operate the phone in it without problems. There’s even a transparent back window so you can take photos through it, and as far as those go I do find the results are satisfactorily.

<p>And the prize of the comfiest climbing pants of 2014 goes to: <a href="http://www.jung-ware.de/">JUNG</a>! The emil from JUNG is not just super comfortable and stylish, nope, it is Designed in Cologne, sewn in Poland from <em>Global Organic Textile Standard</em> certified organic cotton and comes in very limited runs. I love the stretchy waistband which is so comfortable you might think you’re naked, it’s a revelation. The deep pockets securely hold everyday items in them while the adjustable trouser legs are ideal for climbing and bouldering. This was the only pants I wore on the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2015/01/petzl-roctrip-2014-turkey.html">Petzl RocTrip</a> and despite six intense days of climbing &amp; travelling it still looked the deal for the last Party on Saturday night.

<p>At 802 g for the adidas Terrex Solo pair in Size 41 1/3 the shoes are reasonably light. What makes this shoe special for me is the Stealth Rubber sole, which is the same rubber Five Ten uses in their climbing shoes. And as this is an approach shoe it makes sense that this shoe has such a grippy sole, because it means you can leave your climbing shoes longer in your pack. And if you’re out for Via Ferratas you’ll love these shoes, too - they give you grip on metal ladders and dry &amp; wet rocks alike. I wore these shoes on the Petzl RocTrip and my three week climbing road trip in Finland and look forward to using them again when the snow is gone. My only concern is the durabilty - because of the super-sticky sole the rubber is already starting to leave in the toe area, and I am curious to see how long they will last.</p>

<p>The Primus Lite+ was our stove of choice on the High Coast Trail in Sweden. It boiled up to 600 ml of water in less than five minutes and was efficient in gas use. A 100 g cartridge fits inside which makes this a very compact and light system indeed: It is 399 g for pot with sleeve &amp; lid and the stove. The stove has a piezo ignition which means you don’t need to bring a firesteel or lighter along, and the new connection between pot and stove is easy and efficient. The sleeve ensure you can hold the pot with boiling water without problems, and you can put the handle over the top and then hang the whole set. And if you’re wondering, because of ™ issues Primus has renamed the EtaLite to Lite+ in 2015. <strong>Expect a more detailed review &amp; video about the Lite+ later this year.</strong></p>

<p>A 25 g cup that packs small - that’s the Foldacup. I found mine on the trail two years ago and have been increasingly taking this one along instead of my Kuksa. The big plus for me is that it packs smaller and is lighter but just as easy to use for scooping water and drinking. It’s orange two - which makes it easier to find in my pack =)</p>

<p>The Swiss Advance Crono Pocket Knife Tool is so light and small that I forgot to take it out of my backpack when flying from Zürich home to Helsinki. The big surprise was that the Swiss security people had no problem with me taking this little Multittol inside of the plane - their only concern was that the bottle opener might not be durable enough, something that I can dismiss after opening plenty of beers with it. This little tool packs thirteen other tools, from a handy knife to a screw driver and awl. It’s a nifty little gadget but if you just need a knife then there are lighter options available. / 38 g</p>

<p>This very lightweight jacket packs small in its own chest pocket when not needed and weighs a scant 159 g in Size M. It is waterproof though after an hour in heavy rain it leaked a bit, but for a spring or summer shower that shouldn’t be a problem at all. And it works as a great windjacket, too. My wife really liked the stylish look with the coloured zippers making it stand out, and it was simple in use but doesn’t lack anything - the sleeves that are tight from the wrists with no adjustments needed. It’s a womanly fit that’s not too loose but you can fit two layers comfortably under it (probably even three if the third one is a top). </p>

The fabric is neither too thick or too thin and feels smooth and light on the skin which makes it comfortable to wear. With 202 g in Size M it is light enough to use as a protector from the sun or as a layer, has a good breathability and it dries quickly. The hood and the long chest zipper help with venting while the thumbloops add a bit of warmth when its coller than expected.

<p>I bought the Patagonia Polarized Tee at the start of spring 2014 because I wanted a shirt that can be worn in the water (for packrafting and DWS) and on land, with a good UPF protection. The Polarized Tee fitted the bill, came in one of my current favoutite <em>colours</em> and also had a nice print on it (my son loves the print, too)! I can wear it for several days before it starts to develop a bit of a smell, then it just goes to the washing machine and is ready for another adventure.

<p>I have the impression that this autumn there was an increase of cyclists who have figured out that having front &amp; rear lights on your bike is a smart thing in traffic. Of course there are still the un-illuminated Ninjas who cycle in black garments and without lights through the eternal darkness of November, but it’s survival of the illuminated ones, you see. Since four years the Knog Boomer USB is on my handlebar and seatpost, but it’s equally easy to attach to a pram. The lights are bright - the white front Boomer subjectively is seen from a couple of hundred meters away, and in Blink mode in winter it is good to go for five days until it needs to go back to a USB port to be powered up again. The red one keeps the traffic from behind aware of you, which makes these my favourite bike lights for urban cycling and cycle-touring on roads. / 85 g for front &amp; rear light </p>

<p>The Lumen Liner Gloves are super-thin Merino wool gloves and you really shouldn’t do any hard work with them. Because they’re sensitive. And will break. I found them even too sensitive to cycle or walk with a pram, which means mine went broken at the finger tips. I still used them on the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2015/01/hogakustenleden-the-high-coast-trail.html">Högakustenleden</a> last November where they were fine on the warmer days and when I needed dexterity and a bit of warmth, but they slowly are start to fall apart.

They’ve seen also a fair bit of hiking and cycling here, and every time again I was happy to have such warm gloves along. They have a Polartec Power Shield High Loft filling which keeps my fingers toasty warm, while the leather palm ensure good grip on ice tools, ropes &amp; belay device and the handlebar of my bike.

<p>A 137 g light down pullover (Size M). Between the 10X fabric is 900 cuin down and this sweet little pullover has been warm enough for summer adventures, when reaching the summit and there’s a small breeze, chilling at camp or taking a break between bouldering. It packs very small so easily fits in my backpack wherever I go, and is comfortable on the skin. While the material does feel filigrane it can take a bit of abuse, though I have used it strictly as a garment at camp/ resting/ when more warmth was needed. A long zipper helps with getting in and venting, there’s stretchy rims on the hem and cuffs and that’s about it. Really something for a SUL setup!</p>

The hood keeps the ears and head warm. It looks nice. Yeps, with the Patagonia Nano-Puffy Hoody you’re warm &amp; well-dressed in the three warm seasons!</p>

<p>305 g in Size XS, the Houdini Thrill Twill Pants was along on lot of trips this year. The reason is simple: It’s a well-fitting pants with great freedom of movement. Hiking, scrambling, climbing, going to the pub or business meetings at the OutDoor, the Thrill Twill Pants does it all well while being comfortable. The biggest plus for me is probably that the size is so great, in XS I don’t need a belt and it fits perfectly. High heel hooks are no problem, and the pants dries fast when the get wet. Stretchy drawstring allow me to adjust the size of the trouser legs, very useful when climbing and wanting to see where that micro ledge for my next step is. A beautiful pair of trousers that’s durable and can be recycled at the end of its life.</p>

<p>I have been using fleece jackets again for several years, and the Haglöfs Triton II Hood, a full-zip fleece jacket with thumbloops &amp; a hood, has been a staple in my layering system since I got it last year. The hood can be worn under a helmet, be it a cycle helmet or my <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/petzl-sirocco-helmet.html">Petzl Sirocco</a>, while the thumbloops help on those first cool autumn days where I forgot to take a pair of gloves along for the bicycle ride. Three zippered pockets store stuff safely on the go, be it hiking, hill walking or climbing. It’s a comfy fleece jacket in a beautiful colour, and if I need a nice, cozy yet breathable midlayer or I’m cool in the mornings at home then the Triton II comes on. / 303 g in Size S.</p>

<p>The Norrøna bitihorn aero100 Jacket (104 g in Size M) accompanies me since autumn 2013 already and has been a joy to use. It’s lightweight and can be packed in its own chest pocket, which is ideal when travelling. While I occasionally missed a hood I managed to life without it. The Size M was a alright fit despite me being a Size S - I needed to pull the hem drawstring pretty tight for it being a good fit. The jacket stays well in place also when in a cycling position and the material is durable enough to carry heavy grocery backpacks or light backpacking rucksacks. As its always windy on the coast here, the bitihorn aero100 is often along to keep the cool wind at bay.</p>

<p>I’m not 100% happy with the Merrell AllOut Rush - the large drop is likely the reason for that. It’s not as minimal anymore as other shoes from Merrell and after wearing them for a while and switching into more minimalist shoes I realize how my stride has suffered. That said, if you’re new to the whole barefoot hiking &amp; walking movement you might find the AllOut Rush just perfect. It’s a nice shoe with good grip on many surfaces, from wet grass to muddy uphills. The toe box offers your toes plenty of space, and the heel cup also gives a good fit. / 556 g in Size 42.</p>

<p>It was about time that I replaced the 60 l stuff sack I used for transporting my ultralight backpacks when flying abroad for a hike: It already had a few holes at it and somehow always arrived open in Vaasa’s airport at the baggage claim. That no longer happens with the Arc’teryx Carrier Duffle 50: It stays closed and also the occasional downpours the duffle needs to endure when it’s loaded in to the plane are no problem anymore: The Carrier Duffle is highly water resistant. It is just 538 g heavy, which is in comparison with other duffles almost SUL! I can wear it backpack style or over the shoulder and at the airport the straps can be pulled tight and stored out of the way. At the top and bottom there is a haul loop and on each side there’s a handle - so you or the friendly airport employee can carry the duffle as it was intended. A superb piece of kit that goes along on every trip abroad.</p>

<p>Using chalk is pretty much essential when climbing, even more so when bouldering. <em>“Chalk up correctly”</em> was something I heard quite a few times during the last weeks climbing &amp; bouldering, and I was happy to have pharmaceutical grade Magnesium Carbonate chalk from Rock Technologies in my chalk bag. A chalk ball reduces air born chalk dust and so is more healthy - if you ever visited the <a href="http://www.boulderwelt.de/">Boulderwelt in München</a> you will wish everyone would use chalkballs! Anyway, the chalkballs are easy to use and it’s fast &amp; efficient for chalking up. The chalk is good and helps you to stick to slopers and prevents sweaty hands &amp; fingers for a good while. / 60 g</p>

<p>Also known as <em>Cheater Gloves</em> these 48 g light gloves allow you to climb cracks like Spiderman without ripping open your knuckles and the back of your hand. Also sweaty hands are no longer responsible for slipping in a crack. Sure, you could just tape up your hands and be tough when you go up a crack, but I find the Crack Gloves much better, really. Easy to use - the most difficult thing is figuring out your size - the gloves close with a Velcro strap and the outside is made of a sticky rubber which gives a lot of friction. The side that’s to the back of your hand has a cushioned mesh lining which makes sharp, sharp cracks slightly more bearable. If you’re starting to get into crack climbing - get a pair. They’re cheaper than all the tape you’re bound to wrap around your hands, and a lot better.</p>

<p>The 47 g light Peak Design Leash I bought earlier this year as I realized that my Dyneema cord ain’t the best solution to carry my camera (<a href="http://youtu.be/wHUFWUGWKS4?list=UU927vE_KkPy6pFJboaJ9Lig">as explained here</a>). I’ve been very happy with the Leash, it’s worlds more comfortable than the Dyneema string and easy to use, too. If it’s not needed or could get into the way I can quickly take it off, and the many varied possibilities the Leash can be used make it a really versatile camera strap. It’s also compatible the the Peak Design Strap and the new systems, which I’m considering trying out next.</p>

<p>A companion since well over a year, the Hariyama Productions coin case is a 4 g cuben wallet and all I need for carrying cash &amp; cards. It can get a bit tight when I have several business cards in there and need to carry cash, but in Finland I rarely need anything else than a Debit/ Credit Card either way so there’s no need to search for coins or bills. It has been water-resistant but after being daily pulled out of my pocket between a few times and a dozen times it look like I will need to get a new one. They come with differently coloured zippers and I think I will go for a orange one the next time! </p>
