<p><a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/gear-outtakes/">Gear Outtakes</a> is a seasonal collection of kit and what I think about it.</p>

<p>★☆☆☆
Mediocre, I wouldn’t spend money on it.</p>

<p>★★☆☆
Good, but there are better options.</p>

<p>★★★☆
Great, worth your money.</p>

<p>★★★★
Outstanding, the benchmark of its category.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/21486717599/in/dateposted/" title="inov-8 X-Talon 212"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/616/21486717599_6d3d0e0a54_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="inov-8 X-Talon 212" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Now while I have wide feet and a narrow heel, that wasn’t the only reason I wanted to try the new <a href="http://www.inov-8.com/New/Global/Product-View-Footwear-OffRoad-X-Talon-212-Black-Yellow-Blue.asp?L=26&amp;WA=&amp;G=Male">inov-8 X-Talon 212</a>. It also has the typical inov-8 rubber sole which gives great grip on soft, wet, hard and dry trails alike. The shoe is comfortable on the feet, pretty breathable and flexible, with good laces that keep the shoe in place and you running or hiking for many kilometres. The only drawback is as usually that the rubber doesn’t hold long on hard rock and asphalt, so keep them away - especially from the latter. A comfortable shoe which should make those with wide feet very happy. / 488 g in Size 43</p>

<h2 id="arcteryx-sarix-ss-shirt">Arc’teryx Sarix SS Shirt</h2>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/21647481516/in/dateposted/" title="Arc&#x27;teryx Sarix SS Shirt"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5784/21647481516_40526244e2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Arc&#x27;teryx Sarix SS Shirt" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>At 70 g in Size S the <a href="http://arcteryx.com/product.aspx?language=EN&amp;gender=mens&amp;collection=Endorphin&amp;model=Sarix-SS">Arc’teryx Sarix SS</a> is the lightest shirt in my closet. It’s an ultralight trailrunning and backpacking shirt that’s super breathable with its mesh construction. The flat seams don’t bother when running with a pack, and the shirt feels very soft on the skin. It dries fast after your run, be it on the body or hanging in the wind. The cut gives nice freedom of movement and the material is surprisingly immune to getting snagged when running through narrow trails.</p>

<h2 id="arcteryx-soleus-shorts">Arc’teryx Soleus Shorts</h2>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/21662139852/in/dateposted/" title="Arc&#x27;teryx Soleus Shorts"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5623/21662139852_734835f3a2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Arc&#x27;teryx Soleus Shorts" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>My <a href="http://arcteryx.com/product.aspx?language=EN&amp;gender=mens&amp;collection=Endorphin&amp;model=Soleus-Short">Soleus Shorts</a> from Arc’teryx are like my Sarix Shirt already a few years old - I ran for example the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/09/run-or-die-nuuksio-classic-trail-marathon.html">Nuuksio Classic Trail Marathon</a> in both and have been hiking and running in them a lot, too. The shorts have five pockets and my main gripe about them is that they’re a bad size to keep the iPhone 5 reliably in place. There’s one large stretchy back pocket in the middle which is just a bit too big for the iPhone 5 so that it moves around in it and can drop out. The other four pockets - two more in the back and two mre in the front - are again just too small to hold the phone, but do a good job at storing gels and snacks. The large main pocket in the back can take a wind jacket for when the weather turns nasty. It has an inside mesh shorts which means you can leave your underwear at home, and the fit is superb - no chafing or pressure points with great freedom of movement. I also have been swimming in them, which works well though they need a bit longer to dry. A great running and backpacking shorts if you like to go light &amp; fast. / 122 g in Size S</p>

<h2 id="outdoor-research-activeice-sun-sleeves">Outdoor Research ActiveIce Sun Sleeves</h2>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/21052551913/in/dateposted/" title="Outdoor Research ActiveIce Sun Sleeves"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/569/21052551913_f96105b11b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Outdoor Research ActiveIce Sun Sleeves" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<br />25€, available at <a href="http://bit.ly/1NO1BSN">Backcountry.com</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/1VbXWyD">Campsaver.com</a></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.outdoorresearch.com/eub_en/catalog/product/view/id/56654/s/activeice-sun-sleeve-1/category/2206/">Outdoor Research ActiveIce Sun Sleeves</a> are a cool and light extra for hikers and trailrunners. While their primary raison d’être is to keep your arms from getting sun-induced skin cancer - their UPF 50+ rating takes care of that - and staying cool - the ActiveIce material somehow manages to do that - they also work pretty good when you only have a T-Shirt on and need some extra warmth &amp; protection. The sleeves are easy to put on and stay in place thanks to a silicone print on the inside, have reflective details to make you visible between dusk and dawn and a thumbloop helps with keeping your wrists warmer. A cool, lightweight extra for trailrunners, paddler and backpackers. / 34 g in Size L/XL</p>

<h2 id="petzl-tikka-rxp">Petzl Tikka RXP</h2>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/21052552473/in/dateposted/" title="Petzl Tikka RXP"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/600/21052552473_ede74991c2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Petzl Tikka RXP" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>★★★★
<br />100€, available at <a href="http://bit.ly/1PvFNdJ">Backcountry.com</a>, <a href="http://www.bergzeit.co.uk/petzl-tikka-rxp-headlamp-korallenrot/">Bergzeit.co.uk</a>, <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/petzl-tikka-rxp-stirnlampe/">Bergfreunde.de</a>, <a href="https://www.globetrotter.de/shop/petzl-tikka-rxp-235654-schwarz?utm_source=PTID13002584">Globetrotter</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/1OTQ3OE">Campsaver.com</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/1NVorcK">REI</a></p>

<p>I got the <a href="http://www.petzl.com/en/Sport/PERFORMANCE-headlamps/TIKKA-RXP?l=INT#.VgOUnrRGBA4">Petzl Tikka RXP</a> as part of a welcome package to the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/01/petzl-roctrip-2014-turkey.html">RocTrip in Turkey</a>. At first I was sceptical - do I really need another headlamp? But somehow the Tikka RXP has managed to silently convince me as it has sneaked awfully often into my pack and onto my head when more light in the dark was needed. The Tikka RXP has red and white light, and the latter makes use of Petzl’s Reactive Lightning technology where the lamp adjust its output according to what you’re doing; from a low, wide beam to check the map and work at camp to a powerful spot distance mode which lets you see far. The headlamp can be re-charged on the trail via a USB cable, so you can attach it to a power pack or solar charger when the battery indicator tells you it’s time to recharge. At 105 g it’s not the lightest headlamp available but for outdoor activities after dark where you need a lot of light I found the Tikka RXP a superb headlamp.</p>

<h2 id="primus-spider-stove">Primus Spider Stove</h2>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/21485623180/in/dateposted/" title="Primus Spider Stove"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5697/21485623180_de2ef1159d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Primus Spider Stove" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>★★☆☆
<br />130€, available at <a href="">Backcountry.com</a>, <a href="http://www.bergzeit.co.uk/primus-spider-stove-set/">Bergzeit.co.uk</a>, <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/primus-spider-stove-set-gaskocher/">Bergfreunde.de</a>, <a href="https://www.globetrotter.de/shop/primus-spider-stove-set-254485?utm_source=PTID13002584">Globetrotter</a>, <a href="">Campsaver.com</a> and <a href="">REI</a></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.primus.eu/spider-stove-set">Primus Spider Stove</a> arrived at the beginning of this year and I was a bit doubtful if I’d ever use it. Spring turned to summer and with it came family hikes and weekend trips with friends, and somehow the Spider Stove managed to get itself taken along to the forests and lakes to boil water for us. It’s a good stove or up to three people I figured out after a few trips, just boiling enough to re-hydrate three meals (á 300 ml each) or three cups of coffee. The windscreen has magnets at the bottom which the stove unit securely connects to, but it is heavy. What I find really annoying is that I can’t transport a big 230 g cartridge in the pot - a 100 g cartridge fits barely with the stove inside. Overall more of a camping/ day hikes/ easy backpacking stove for me than a stove for long backpacking trips, although for the aforementioned trips a slightly bigger pot would be desirable. / 562 g for pot, lid, stove and windscreen</p>

<h2 id="mammut-realization-shorts">Mammut Realization Shorts</h2>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/21485712258/in/dateposted/" title="Mammut Realization Shorts"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/702/21485712258_203c0e4507_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Mammut Realization Shorts" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<br />170€, available at <a href="http://bit.ly/1KCU9FF">Backcountry.com</a>, <a href="http://www.bergzeit.co.uk/mammut-realization-shorts-graphite-s/">Bergzeit.co.uk</a>, <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/mammut-realization-shorts-short-klettergurt/">Bergfreunde.de</a>, <a href="https://www.globetrotter.de/shop/mammut-realisation-shorts-256684?utm_source=PTID13002584">Globetrotter</a>, and <a href="http://bit.ly/1YCEvDF">Campsaver.com</a> </p>

<p>Have you ever thought <em>“I wish I’d have my harness along?”</em> after seeing a great cliff for climbing? Well if you’re wearing the <a href="http://www.mammut.ch/store/INT/en/B2C-Category/Equipment/Climbing-Equipment/Harnesses/Realization-Shorts/p/2110-01151">Realization Shorts</a> that won’t be an issue - as they have a harness integrated in them! I was sceptical of the concept before trying them on, but need to say that I really like them. They’re not just stylish and comfortable when hiking to the crag, once you tie in and climb in them they remain comfortable. There’s two gear loops on the front for them so it’s best used for sports climbing, and a chalk bag attaches in the back. Four roomy pockets store phone, key and wallet on the go and an integrated mesh liner shorts means you don’t need to wear underwear in them. The harness does its job well and is comfy and distributes weight well when hanging in it. The tie-in point is pretty neat, too, and there’s a bit of an elastic “belt” to adjust the fit, thought I recommend you buy them in the right size. / 506 g in Size M</p>

<h2 id="edelrid-cable-ultralite-21">Edelrid Cable Ultralite 2.1</h2>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/21486715559/in/dateposted/" title="Edelrid Cable Ultralite 2.1"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/676/21486715559_a5d0d57326_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Edelrid Cable Ultralite 2.1" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>★★★★
<br />90€, available at <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/edelrid-cable-ul-2-1-klettersteigset/?key=Edelrid+Cable+UL+2.1+Klettersteigset&amp;cat=suggest">Bergzeit.de</a>, <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/edelrid-cable-ul-21-klettersteigset/">Bergfreunde.de</a> and <a href="https://www.globetrotter.de/shop/edelrid-cable-ultralight-21-234070-night-oasis?utm_source=PTID13002584">Globetrotter</a></p>

<p>This year I have been doing quite a few Via Ferrata trips, and applying my ultralight principles to this activity was normal for me. The lightest available Via Ferrata Set on the market is the <a href="http://www.edelrid.de/sports/klettersteigsets/cable-ultralite-2-1-night-oasis.html">Cable Ultralite 2.1</a> from Edelrid. At just 302 g you get two comfortable and easy-to use Via Ferrata carabiners on differently long leashes, a shock absorber and a tie in point. The materials are all high-quality and durable. The carabiner lays comfortably in the hand and is easy to clip to the steel wire, though the differently long leashes mean you need to try to clip them always in the same order otherwise they tend to tangle up. I haven’t fallen on it yet so can’t comment on the shock absorber, but am positive that it too works good. Overall a great choice for a Via Ferrata Set if light weight is important.</p>

<h2 id="norrna-fjr-dri1-pants">Norrøna fjørå dri1 Pants</h2>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/21485714068/in/dateposted/" title="Norrøna fjørå dri1 Pants"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5679/21485714068_93e90a6afb_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Norrøna fjørå dri1 Pants" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>★★★★
<br />230€, available at <a href="http://bit.ly/1ixVB4J">Backcountry.com</a>, <a href="http://www.bergzeit.co.uk/norrona-fjora-dri3-shorts-cool-black-electric-blue-s/">Bergzeit.co.uk</a> and <a href="https://www.globetrotter.de/shop/norroena-fjora-flex1-pants-248509-caribbean-blue?utm_source=PTID13002584">Globetrotter</a></p>

<p>The fjørå garments are made for riding down singletrack on your Mountain Bike, which makes it a damn fine line for bikepacking, too. The fjørå dri1 Pants are water and windproof while being reasonably breathable - a lot more so if you open up the thigh vents on each side. The one thigh pocket on the left leg stores phone and keys so you always track your rides &amp; runs on Strava, and the trouser legs can be adjusted a bit in width via a zipper and Velcro. In the seat and knees there are stretchy inserts which are great, and the silicone print on the waistband inside ensures the pants stay where they belong. The width can be adjusted via Velcro straps on the left and right. I’ve used them on warm summer mornings and cool spring evenings on my rides and found them a damn comfy pants. The legs are narrow enough so that I don’t get chain oil on them and the side vents ensure I don’t run too hot in them when the thermometer climbs above 20°C. / 208 g in Size S</p>

<h2 id="norrna-fjr-equaliser-polo-shirt">Norrøna fjørå equaliser polo Shirt</h2>

<p>Stylish and keeps my throat warm, that’s the <a href="https://www.norrona.com/en-GB/Products/7050-13/7760/fjora-equaliser-polo-shirt-m/">fjørå equaliser polo Shirt</a> from Norrøna. What’s special about this Polo shirt is that you can flip the collar up and then close it with two buttons, which is especially for cycling on windy days a superb invention. It’s a synthetic shirt which is a bit thicker so nice warm just under a jacket on a ride, but not too hot on warm days on it own. It does smell a wee bit after a long day of cycling, but that’s just inherit with the material. It does wick sweat quickly away and dries reasonably fast so you don’t have cold chills when standing around in it after you came down the singletrail. The small pocket is big enough for an iPhone 5 and your wallet. A fine Polo that I also wear on other occasions than cycling. / 184 g in Size S</p>

<h2 id="norrna-fjr-dri1-jacket">Norrøna fjørå dri1 Jacket</h2>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/21052551653/in/dateposted/" title="Norrøna fjørå dri1 Jacket"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/746/21052551653_afb8c68411_b.jpg" width="1014" height="1024" alt="Norrøna fjørå dri1 Jacket" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<br />240€, available at <a href="http://www.bergzeit.co.uk/norrona-fjora-dri1-jacket-bamboo-green-electric-blue-s/">Bergzeit.co.uk</a></p>

<p>And to conclude my Norrøna fjørå cycling kit the <a href="https://www.norrona.com/en-GB/Products/7000-12/6800/fjora-dri1-jacket-m/">dri1 Jacket</a> joined me on spring and summer rides. This water and windproof jacket has a nice long back to keep also the lower back protected when you’re leaning far down on your <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/11/pelago-bicycles-stavanger.html">race bike</a>, while the ventilation zips at the upper arm are directed a bit forward to catch your headwind and cool you down. The cuffs can be tight or open for more ventilation, and also the high collar can be cinched tight to let no wind in, though I have never felt a need for doing that. The one chest pocket is tiny and a iPhone 5 barely fits in there. The hem has two drawstring adjusters to ensure it stays put, and is one of the few jackets where it actually work. It’s my go-to cycling jacket in any weather, from windy &amp; sunny summer days to rainy spring morning, the fjørå dri1 Jacket is a favourite companion on bike rides. / 175 g in Size M</p>

<p>Yes, sometimes you need to wash all these fine garments presented here. As that is my job, I bought <a href="http://toko.ch/en/products/care-line/textile-care/eco-textile-wash">Toko Eco Wash Textile</a> to keep hiking, cycling, climbing and running shirts and trousers clean. One bottle is good for running six to ten machines, with about three to five garments per machine. The detergent is biodegradable and contains no dyes, optical bleaches, whiteners or phosphates. I wash baselayers (shirts like the Norrøna fjørå Polo and the Arc’teryx Sarix SS Shirt above), trousers and even jackets with this detergent, and they come out clean and with a neutral smell (I don’t like deodorized detergents). It can be used at low washing temperatures which is often the case with these synthetic garments, and allows you keep your expensive gear in shape for the next adventure. / 290 g for 250 ml</p>

<p>I love climbing, and the <a href="http://www.camp.it/EN/template01.aspx?codicemenu=1475">CAMP Supernova</a> was my try to get my wife fall in love with it too. With the Supernova Harness being a harness conceived by women, designed by women, and built for women I thought this will be the harness for her, and while she did like the lightweight and comfortable harness she isn’t as obsessed about climbing as me. M liked the padding and ease of adjustment of the harness, with a fully adjustable waist and leg loops, and the No-Twist belay loop came in handy when she was belaying me. / 360 g in Size M</p>

<p>Gloves, the eternal struggle. If all you need gloves for is that they keep your fingers warm and look good you’re a lucky person and won’t understand the “Search for the perfect glove” that outdoor enthusiasts, and especially ice climbers, conduct. The <a href="https://hestragloves.com/sport/intl/gloves/mountaineering/ergo-grip-outdry-dexterity-long-five-finger/100100/">Hestra Ergo Grip OutDry Dexterity Long</a> is as close to the perfect ice climbing and mountaineering glove I have come, me thinks. It is warm, waterproof with an OutDry membrane, offers superb dexterity and is very, very durable. I have used this fine glove for two winters now and some mountaineering and love it. It’s easy to clip ropes, open ‘biners, conduct fiddly work and keep warm fingers, even when water is running down the shaft of your ice tools. / 186 g for the Pair in Size 9</p>

<p>294 in that name stands for the 294 steel studs with carbide pins on these tires, which makes these <em>the</em> cycling tires for icy conditions - and thanks to the triple thaw + freeze cycles we had this “<em>winter</em>” (and the last one, too) the <a href="http://www.suomityres.com/eng/tyres/">Gazza Extreme</a> have been very, very useful. Suomi Tyres is a small company from Eastern Finland and they know how to make some of the best bicycle tires on the planet - they are since 90 years in this business. They’re the only bicycle tyre manufacturer in Northern Europe (check this <a href="https://youtu.be/lxYa4Lb3VRI?list=UUl1rmXRFLvoJlm4E8UirZVw">video of how the tires are made</a>) and produce since ten years already environmentally sound tires from pure rubber compounds. I have ridden the Gazza Extreme on my 29er in the last two winters and didn’t slip once with them on icy roads and frozen lakes. These tires are on the bike a good five to six months a year and so far have yet to lose one stud! / 1090 g per tyre</p>

<p>Back to boots! Well, not really, but for Nordic Skating and Backcountry XC Skiing the <a href="http://lundhags.se/">Lundhags</a> BC Guide Boots have been fantastic. The shoe was out of the box comfortable, in part probably thanks to the 3 mm wool felt liner boot which can be removed. The boot itself is made from a Perwanger split leather on top which has been great in shedding water and snow and keeping my feet dry, and a Certech 4.5 cellular rubber as a midlayer, with a Rottefella® BC sole underneath which allows you to click into NNN bindings - be these on skis or Nordic Skates is up to you! The laces are long but allowed me to fit the boot well to my feet, and the boot is well insulated against the cold from below so that your feet stay toasty when you’re out on the ice. More on these in detail next year. / 1540 g for the Pair in Size 40</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.rocktechnologies.co.uk/order-online/">Rock Technologies Revive Creme</a> is one of those products that I use to treat my hands after climbing. It helps to heal my hands and makes them fit for the next round on the gym wall or rock.

I wore my <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2012/03/finisterre-zephyr-boxer-shorts.html">Finisterre Boxers</a> till they were broken and the Anatomica have been a worthy replacement. The colours and fit are spot on, sometimes I find the waistband folds over (for example when cycling or climbing) but overall these have been great. The Merino wool makes these my choice of underwear on backpacking trips as you can wear them for several days and they stay fresh, and the flatlock seams &amp; thin material make them very comfortable on the trail. / 51 g in Size M</p>

I found it especially useful in winter when I need to wear my phone close to my body so it stays warm - the battery drains like nothing in the cold - but it can get wet from my sweat. The case has been 100% waterproof thus far and the transparent front lets me operate the phone in it without problems. There’s even a transparent back window so you can take photos through it, and as far as those go I do find the results are satisfactorily. If you need a waterproof case for your phone that’s also light, check this one out! / 23 g</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.outdoorresearch.com/en/mens/jackets/mens-enchainment-jacket.html">Enchainment Jacket</a> has been my jacket of choice on the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/01/koli-national-park.html">UL Summit 2013</a> and many hikes before and after. It’s a very water-resistant softshell that can withstand the abuse of carrying a backpack, scrambling up hills and bushwhacking through dense undergrowth. Schoeller NanoSphere panels on the sides add breathability &amp; freedom of movement while the softshell fabric that’s used in the sleeves and torso keep the wind &amp; rain outside and me toasty on the inside - but not too hot &amp; neither too cold. The pockets are a tad small to take in a standard map but carry gloves &amp; beanie without problems while the triple adjustable hood ensure clear views also in a downpour. / 469 g in Size S. </p>

<p>And the prize of the comfiest climbing pants of 2014 goes to: <a href="http://www.jung-ware.de/">JUNG</a>! The emil from JUNG is not just super comfortable and stylish, nope, it is Designed in Cologne, sewn in Poland from <em>Global Organic Textile Standard</em> certified organic cotton and comes in very limited runs. I love the stretchy waistband which is so comfortable you might think you’re naked, it’s a revelation. The deep pockets securely hold everyday items in them while the adjustable trouser legs are ideal for climbing and bouldering. This was the only pants I wore on the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2015/01/petzl-roctrip-2014-turkey.html">Petzl RocTrip</a> and despite six intense days of climbing &amp; travelling it still looked the deal for the last Party on Saturday night.

<p>At 802 g for the adidas Terrex Solo pair in Size 41 1/3 the shoes are reasonably light. What makes this shoe special for me is the Stealth Rubber sole, which is the same rubber Five Ten uses in their climbing shoes. And as this is an approach shoe it makes sense that this shoe has such a grippy sole, because it means you can leave your climbing shoes longer in your pack. And if you’re out for Via Ferratas you’ll love these shoes, too - they give you grip on metal ladders and dry &amp; wet rocks alike. I wore these shoes on the Petzl RocTrip and my three week climbing road trip in Finland and look forward to using them again when the snow is gone. My only concern is the durabilty - because of the super-sticky sole the rubber is already starting to leave in the toe area, and I am curious to see how long they will last.</p>

<p>The Primus Lite+ was our stove of choice on the High Coast Trail in Sweden. It boiled up to 600 ml of water in less than five minutes and was efficient in gas use. A 100 g cartridge fits inside which makes this a very compact and light system indeed: It is 399 g for pot with sleeve &amp; lid and the stove. The stove has a piezo ignition which means you don’t need to bring a firesteel or lighter along, and the new connection between pot and stove is easy and efficient. The sleeve ensure you can hold the pot with boiling water without problems, and you can put the handle over the top and then hang the whole set. And if you’re wondering, because of ™ issues Primus has renamed the EtaLite to Lite+ in 2015. <strong>Expect a more detailed review &amp; video about the Lite+ later this year.</strong></p>

<p>A 25 g cup that packs small - that’s the Foldacup. I found mine on the trail two years ago and have been increasingly taking this one along instead of my Kuksa. The big plus for me is that it packs smaller and is lighter but just as easy to use for scooping water and drinking. It’s orange two - which makes it easier to find in my pack =)</p>

<p>The Swiss Advance Crono Pocket Knife Tool is so light and small that I forgot to take it out of my backpack when flying from Zürich home to Helsinki. The big surprise was that the Swiss security people had no problem with me taking this little Multittol inside of the plane - their only concern was that the bottle opener might not be durable enough, something that I can dismiss after opening plenty of beers with it. This little tool packs thirteen other tools, from a handy knife to a screw driver and awl. It’s a nifty little gadget but if you just need a knife then there are lighter options available. / 38 g</p>

<p>This very lightweight jacket packs small in its own chest pocket when not needed and weighs a scant 159 g in Size M. It is waterproof though after an hour in heavy rain it leaked a bit, but for a spring or summer shower that shouldn’t be a problem at all. And it works as a great windjacket, too. My wife really liked the stylish look with the coloured zippers making it stand out, and it was simple in use but doesn’t lack anything - the sleeves that are tight from the wrists with no adjustments needed. It’s a womanly fit that’s not too loose but you can fit two layers comfortably under it (probably even three if the third one is a top). </p>

<p>The Women’s Flyway Zip Hoody is a versatile shirt that you can use for many different sports and also wear it in the city because of the neutral &amp; stylish look with the feminine fit. The fabric is neither too thick or too thin and feels smooth and light on the skin which makes it comfortable to wear. With 202 g in Size M it is light enough to use as a protector from the sun or as a layer, has a good breathability and it dries quickly. The hood and the long chest zipper help with venting while the thumbloops add a bit of warmth when its coller than expected. The small pocket stores keys, wallet and phone or a couple ot snacks when out running.</p>

<p>I bought the Patagonia Polarized Tee at the start of spring 2014 because I wanted a shirt that can be worn in the water (for packrafting and DWS) and on land, with a good UPF protection. The Polarized Tee fitted the bill, came in one of my current favoutite <em>colours</em> and also had a nice print on it (my son loves the print, too)! I can wear it for several days before it starts to develop a bit of a smell, then it just goes to the washing machine and is ready for another adventure. It ain’t as light as other <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/05/lightweight-hiking-shirts.html">hiking shirts</a> at 159 g in Size S, but it’s still light enough to not bother me. </p>

<p>Wear a helmet, they say. But only a <a href="http://bernunlimited.com/shop/bike/men/brentwood-451.html">Bern Brentwood</a>, I say. Because if you already are bullied by the car industry in wearing this accessory, let it at least look cool. And with the visor it not just looks cool, it also keeps the sun and rain out of your eyes. The eleven ventilation openings ensure that I don’t overheat with the Brentwood on my skull, and in winter you even can add some warmer linings. And of course you can look down on the non-helmet wearing cyclists when you stop next to them at the stop light and get plus points when the police stops you for speeding. / 428 g in Size L </p>

<p>I have the impression that this autumn there was an increase of cyclists who have figured out that having front &amp; rear lights on your bike is a smart thing in traffic. Of course there are still the un-illuminated Ninjas who cycle in black garments and without lights through the eternal darkness of November, but it’s survival of the illuminated ones, you see. Since four years the Knog Boomer USB is on my handlebar and seatpost, but it’s equally easy to attach to a pram. The lights are bright - the white front Boomer subjectively is seen from a couple of hundred meters away, and in Blink mode in winter it is good to go for five days until it needs to go back to a USB port to be powered up again. The red one keeps the traffic from behind aware of you, which makes these my favourite bike lights for urban cycling and cycle-touring on roads. / 85 g for front &amp; rear light </p>

Sure, the safest way to secure your bike would be with a U-lock <em>AND</em> a Cable lock, which I’d do if I’d need to park my bike in Amsterdam and other cities were bicycle thieves are on the loose, but right now, here in Finland, the Ringmaster and Lock Combo has been plenty of security. The Ringmaster allows me to secure both wheels and frame to a immovable object, which is enough to scare off the opportunistic bicycle thief in this country. / 601 g for cable &amp; lock</p>

<p>The Lumen Liner Gloves are super-thin Merino wool gloves and you really shouldn’t do any hard work with them. Because they’re sensitive. And will break. I found them even too sensitive to cycle or walk with a pram, which means mine went broken at the finger tips. I still used them on the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2015/01/hogakustenleden-the-high-coast-trail.html">Högakustenleden</a> last November where they were fine on the warmer days and when I needed dexterity and a bit of warmth, but they slowly are start to fall apart. It’s a shame as they’re warm and light.

<p>I picked up a pair of Lodestar Gloves at the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/02/ispo-news-2014.html">ISPO 2014</a> and have had them along ice climbing in Korouoma, Höstvesi and Abisko, mountaineering in Chamonix and was skiing with them just last week. They’ve seen also a fair bit of hiking and cycling here, and every time again I was happy to have such warm gloves along. They have a Polartec Power Shield High Loft filling which keeps my fingers toasty warm, while the leather palm ensure good grip on ice tools, ropes &amp; belay device and the handlebar of my bike. When out ice climbing these are my dedicated belay gloves as they’re warm, have a lot of grip and allow for dexterity - an important thing when you are belaying your mate or rappelling. / 120 g for the pair in Size M.</p>

The Beanie fits well under my Bern Helmet and various jacket hoods and is functional &amp; cool at the same time, definitely a garment you can wear in winter to the office - same goes for the tube. The Flatlock seam  in green on the Tube is a nice detail and does not bother.

<p>I often get sent products or get asked to do reviews about gear though right now I’m short of time to do my <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/gear-reviews/">in-depth reviews</a>. As I still use the kit quite a bit, Gear Outtakes is my solution to the problem - a seasonal collection of kit and what I think about it, inspired by <a href="http://www.minimallyminimal.com/">Minimally Minimal</a>.</p>

<p>★☆☆☆
Mediocre, I wouldn’t spend money on it.</p>

<p>★★☆☆
Good, but there are better options.</p>

<p>★★★☆
Great, worth your money.</p>

<p>A 137 g light down pullover (Size M). Between the 10X fabric is 900 cuin down and this sweet little pullover has been warm enough for summer adventures, when reaching the summit and there’s a small breeze, chilling at camp or taking a break between bouldering. It packs very small so easily fits in my backpack wherever I go, and is comfortable on the skin. While the material does feel filigrane it can take a bit of abuse, though I have used it strictly as a garment at camp/ resting/ when more warmth was needed. A long zipper helps with getting in and venting, there’s stretchy rims on the hem and cuffs and that’s about it. Really something for a SUL setup!</p>

With the Expedition note books from Field Notes I can be sure that my notes will survive down pours and freezing cold temperatures. The FN-19 Space Pen packs small but is a real pen when in use, which I like. The ink won’t bleach, though it does have a bit of a tendency to smear when not 100% dry. / Pen 19 g, note book 30 g.</p>

<p>If it looks like it will get cool and wet on a spring, summer or autumn trip, the 331 g (Size S) light Nano-Puffy Hoody comes along, often even in conjunction with the PHD WaferLite Shirt. The Nano Puff Hoody is a classic piece and likely a staple in many outdoor mens &amp; womens wardrobe, and for a good reason. It’s a super warm hoody that keeps the wind outside and has a DWR finish that lets you wear it in a light drizzle. Even if it gets wet, it still keeps you warm. It packs in its own inside pocket. The hood keeps the ears and head warm. It looks nice. Yeps, with the Patagonia Nano-Puffy Hoody you’re warm &amp; well-dressed in the three warm seasons!</p>

<p>305 g in Size XS, the Houdini Thrill Twill Pants was along on lot of trips this year. The reason is simple: It’s a well-fitting pants with great freedom of movement. Hiking, scrambling, climbing, going to the pub or business meetings at the OutDoor, the Thrill Twill Pants does it all well while being comfortable. The biggest plus for me is probably that the size is so great, in XS I don’t need a belt and it fits perfectly. High heel hooks are no problem, and the pants dries fast when the get wet. Stretchy drawstring allow me to adjust the size of the trouser legs, very useful when climbing and wanting to see where that micro ledge for my next step is.

<p>I have been using fleece jackets again for several years, and the Haglöfs Triton II Hood, a full-zip fleece jacket with thumbloops &amp; a hood, has been a staple in my layering system since I got it last year. The hood can be worn under a helmet, be it a cycle helmet or my <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/petzl-sirocco-helmet.html">Petzl Sirocco</a>, while the thumbloops help on those first cool autumn days where I forgot to take a pair of gloves along for the bicycle ride. Three zippered pockets store stuff safely on the go, be it hiking, hill walking or climbing. It’s a comfy fleece jacket in a beautiful colour, and if I need a nice, cozy yet breathable midlayer or I’m cool in the mornings at home then the Triton II comes on. / 303 g in Size S.</p>

<p>The Norrøna bitihorn aero100 Jacket (104 g in Size M) accompanies me since autumn 2013 already and has been a joy to use. It’s lightweight and can be packed in its own chest pocket, which is ideal when travelling. While I occasionally missed a hood I managed to life without it. The Size M was a alright fit despite me being a Size S - I needed to pull the hem drawstring pretty tight for it being a good fit. The jacket stays well in place also when in a cycling position and the material is durable enough to carry heavy grocery backpacks or light backpacking rucksacks. As its always windy on the coast here, the bitihorn aero100 is often along to keep the cool wind at bay.</p>

<p>I’m not 100% happy with the Merrell AllOut Rush - the large drop is likely the reason for that. It’s not as minimal anymore as other shoes from Merrell and after wearing them for a while and switching into more minimalist shoes I realize how my stride has suffered. That said, if you’re new to the whole barefoot hiking &amp; walking movement you might find the AllOut Rush just perfect. It’s a nice shoe with good grip on many surfaces, from wet grass to muddy uphills. The toe box offers your toes plenty of space, and the heel cup also gives a good fit. / 556 g in Size 42.</p>

<p>It was about time that I replaced the 60 l stuff sack I used for transporting my ultralight backpacks when flying abroad for a hike: It already had a few holes at it and somehow always arrived open in Vaasa’s airport at the baggage claim. That no longer happens with the Arc’teryx Carrier Duffle 50: It stays closed and also the occasional downpours the duffle needs to endure when it’s loaded in to the plane are no problem anymore: The Carrier Duffle is highly water resistant. It is just 538 g heavy, which is in comparison with other duffles almost SUL! I can wear it backpack style or over the shoulder and at the airport the straps can be pulled tight and stored out of the way. At the top and bottom there is a haul loop and on each side there’s a handle - so you or the friendly airport employee can carry the duffle as it was intended. A superb piece of kit that goes along on every trip abroad.</p>

<p>Using chalk is pretty much essential when climbing, even more so when bouldering. <em>“Chalk up correctly”</em> was something I heard quite a few times during the last weeks climbing &amp; bouldering, and I was happy to have pharmaceutical grade Magnesium Carbonate chalk from Rock Technologies in my chalk bag. A chalk ball reduces air born chalk dust and so is more healthy - if you ever visited the <a href="http://www.boulderwelt.de/">Boulderwelt in München</a> you will wish everyone would use chalkballs! Anyway, the chalkballs are easy to use and it’s fast &amp; efficient for chalking up. The chalk is good and helps you to stick to slopers and prevents sweaty hands &amp; fingers for a good while. / 60 g</p>

<p>Also known as <em>Cheater Gloves</em> these 48 g light gloves allow you to climb cracks like Spiderman without ripping open your knuckles and the back of your hand. Also sweaty hands are no longer responsible for slipping in a crack. Sure, you could just tape up your hands and be tough when you go up a crack, but I find the Crack Gloves much better, really. Easy to use - the most difficult thing is figuring out your size - the gloves close with a Velcro strap and the outside is made of a sticky rubber which gives a lot of friction. The side that’s to the back of your hand has a cushioned mesh lining which makes sharp, sharp cracks slightly more bearable. If you’re starting to get into crack climbing - get a pair. They’re cheaper than all the tape you’re bound to wrap around your hands, and a lot better.</p>

I’ve been very happy with the Leash, it’s worlds more comfortable than the Dyneema string and easy to use, too. If it’s not needed or could get into the way I can quickly take it off, and the many varied possibilities the Leash can be used make it a really versatile camera strap. It’s also compatible the the Peak Design Strap and the new systems, which I’m considering trying out next.</p>

<p>A companion since well over a year, the Hariyama Productions coin case is a 4 g cuben wallet and all I need for carrying cash &amp; cards. It can get a bit tight when I have several business cards in there and need to carry cash, but in Finland I rarely need anything else than a Debit/ Credit Card either way so there’s no need to search for coins or bills. It has been water-resistant but after being daily pulled out of my pocket between a few times and a dozen times it look like I will need to get a new one. They come with differently coloured zippers and I think I will go for a orange one the next time! </p>
