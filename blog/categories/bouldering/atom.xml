    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Romania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Greece and Turkey are host to the 2014 Petzl RocTrip which this year takes the form of a road trip. Come and join this great event and hang out with the likes of <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/08/ueli-steck-interview.html">Ueli Steck</a>, Saïd Belhaj, Dave Graham, Mélissa Le Nevé, Nina Caprez and many more while exploring the crazy good climbing that can be had in Eastern Europe!</p>

<p>The first time I became aware of the <a href="http://www.petzl-roctrip.com/en">Petzl RocTrip</a> was in 2011, when I saw some photos from the event in China. Then in 2012 the video of the event was published and it was mind-blowing. I still love to watch it, and if you have a moment watch it here.</p>

<iframe width="1280" height="720" src="http://hendrikmorkel.github.com//www.youtube.com/embed/EcU255XBlcI?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>In 2013 the Petzl RocTrip traveled to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QllWNEGBKic">Argentina</a> and it was equally inspiring. In 2013 it returned closer to home to the Gorges du Tarn, and now in 2014 the event is back and takes a new, unique format: A road trip across five countries in Eastern Europe. This is a great idea on so many levels, as it promotes what climbing is about in many ways: Travel to new crags, explore new countries, meet new people, climb new types of rock, experience different cultures. In a way it is promoting the dirtbag lifestyle, in a slightly more comfortable way! The teaser sets the mood well:</p>

<p>What is special about the RocTrip are the low costs for taking part in the event: It’s just 15€! Comparing that to the costs of some other events this is <em>very affordable</em>. It’s well organized (<a href="http://www.petzl-roctrip.com/en/practical-information">check the practical information</a>) and you get the opportunity to climb in some unique locations with members of the <a href="http://www.petzl-roctrip.com/en/news/spend-time-your-favorite-athletes-during-2014-petzl-roctrip">Petzl Pro Team</a>. </p>

<p>Interested? Then <a href="http://www.petzl-roctrip.com/en/join-us">pre-register until August 31th, 2014</a> to one (or all!) of the camps you would like to join. <a href="http://www.petzl-roctrip.com/en/practical-information#Transport">Organize your transportation</a>, for example join the carpool or get a ride in the Petzl bus. Book your flights (I’m flying to Antalya which is a smooth connection if flying from Helsinki, Stockholm or Oslo). Then start your <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/06/gimme-kraft.html">climbing training</a> so you’re fit for the hundreds of routes which will be waiting for you! The Petzl Roctrip website has a lot more information available, so check it out, pick the locations you want to join and pre-register! </p>

<p>I will be joining the Roctrip on the last two stops in <a href="http://www.petzl-roctrip.com/en/base-camp/geyikbayiri-turkish-style-columns">Geyikbayiri</a> and <a href="http://www.petzl-roctrip.com/en/base-camp/olympos-climb-sky-fall-water">Olympos</a> and you’ll be able to read about it here and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hikinginfinland">Facebook</a>. But I really hope to meet some of you in Turkey =)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lacking <em>Kraft</em> to do your project or carry your UH pack? Then <a href="http://gimmekraft.com/">Gimme Kraft</a> is the book that helps you develop the power you need to send your next problem.</p>

<p><img style="max-width:100%" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3890/14385371581_1329c62e2d_b.jpg#tl-532816872920317954;1043138249" class="alwaysThinglink" /><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="http://hendrikmorkel.github.com//cdn.thinglink.me/jse/embed.js"></script></p>

<p><em>Kraft, die [kraft]: Vermögen, Fähigkeit zu wirken; [körperliche oder geistige] Stärke</em> / <em>Kraft is German for power, force, strength</em></p>

<p><strong>It’s not about power, it’s about technique</strong> was my bouldering teachers opening line to our group of eager students. And seeing him - a thin and tall guy - climb several rounds upside down in our boulder cave, it’s easy to agree. We went on to learn proper boulder technique, first indoors, then took it to the rocks of Vaasa. But of course some Kraft does help, especially if you already have a good technique. However, Kraft does not magically appear from going climbing - that much I have learned in the three odd years since I have rekindled my passion for the art. Kraft comes from training. Being dedicated in developing a training routine, sticking to it and mixing it up as needed, that’s what this fine book from one of Germany’s best climbing gyms, <a href="http://cafekraft.de/">Café Kraft</a> helps you do. </p>

<p>When you pick up the book you realize that here people were writing who know what they’re talking about. The authors have worked with athletes like Alex Megos, Mayan Smith-Gobat, Stefan Glowacz, Sasha DiGiulian and many more, and have sat down to write this fine training book. It’s bi-lingual in English and Deutsch and comes with a DVD where the exercises can be viewed, as well as extra footage of Wolfgang Güllich training. The book starts out with an introduction to effective climbing training - you get a password to download the full 16 page introduction pdf online - and then sets out with dozens of exercises. The exercises are divided into different categories, like the Bouldering Wall, Pull-Ups, Rings, Floor &amp; Minibars, amongst others.</p>

<p><img style="max-width:100%" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2908/14202091729_e331c948dd_b.jpg#tl-532816872635105282;1043138249" class="alwaysThinglink" /><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="http://hendrikmorkel.github.com//cdn.thinglink.me/jse/embed.js"></script></p>

<p>This really being the first time I set out to train (apart from many years of Kenjutsu) I adhered to the books tips to do most of my training as climbing. In the Bouldering Wall chapter there’s several good exercises which not just train you, but also help you to improve your technique. At home I do the floor exercises and train on the two <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/metolius-rock-rings-3d-trainingsgriffe/">Metolius Rock Rings</a>, though I will need to switch the exercises up soon (the book recommends you change up your training routine at the latest every six weeks as otherwise you’re stagnating). I definitely have seen an increase in power, stamina and also feel like I climb better since I started to work out, and as the book is small and light I also usually carry it along to the boulders to see if there’s a new exercise I could try. </p>

<p>One critic I have about the book it’s that they put the video instructions on a DVD. Living in a household without TV (and DVD Player) and also all our computers being without DVD Drives, I have no opportunity to watch the videos. I’d rather would have seen the videos being available online to stream or download, which makes a lot more sense than a DVD. </p>

<p>Other than that this book really is great, and not just for climbers - though they obviously will benefit the most from reading it and doing the exercises. If you’d like to get more Kraft, get this book, make a personal training plan, stick to it, and see how your climbing and power will improve. Then take it out to the rocks and send your project!</p>

<p>You can order the book online at <a href="http://cafekraft.de/laden/produkte/GK">Café Kraft</a> and <a href="http://shop.boulderkeskus.com/fi/kauppa/muut/kirjallisuus/gimmekraft.html">Boulderkeskus</a> and with some luck buy it at your local climbing gym. </p>

    <id>http://hendrikmorkel.github.com/2014/06/scarpa-stix</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Climbing shoes. Like other <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/shoes/">shoes</a> they can be a source of much discussion. The <a href="http://www.scarpa.net/en/stix.html">Scarpa Stix</a> was popular long before I started climbing, was shelved and now makes a return - and it’s easy to feel when climbing with it why this shoe was and is so popular.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14359890633" title="Scarpa Stix by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3857/14359890633_7b1bf6b62b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Scarpa Stix" /></a></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I like Scarpa’s climbing shoes. The <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2011/08/ultralight-climbing.html">Feroce</a> still gets regularly used on rock and plastic, though since I got the Stix late in 2013 it has been my climbing shoe of choice. There’s much to like about the shoe: There’s the weight of just 402 g for the pair in Size 41, the sticky rubber and the precise feel. One thing which really rules for me is that they’re quick and easy to put on and take off. With the Feroce I had three Velcro straps to open and close and the <a href="http://www.scarpa.net/en/techno-x.html">Techno X</a> uses laces. The Stix uses neither - it’s a slipper that hugs my foot for a wonderful snug fit without being constricting or uncomfortable. In case you’re wondering if it easy to lose the shoe - for example when heel or toe hooking: Nope, no chance. The Stix fits like a glove and doesn’t budge.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14153208177" title="Scarpa Stix by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3914/14153208177_215c9320e1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Scarpa Stix" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14153085520" title="Scarpa Stix by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5477/14153085520_d4f50c85cd_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Scarpa Stix" /></a></p>

<p>Much of that superb fit can be attributed to Heinz Mariacher who designed the Stix - a name very closely connected to high-quality climbing shoes. And this shoe does pack a few high-quality features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <em>Vibram® XS Grip 2</em> sole gives grip on rock and plastic alike</li>
  <li>The <em>X-Tension Randing</em> cradles your foot and heel to enhance your toe power</li>
  <li><em>REB - Reinforced Elastic Band</em> are the blue stripes on top of the shoe which improve the fit of the shoe</li>
  <li>Superb craftsmanship and construction</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14316563156" title="Scarpa Stix by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5526/14316563156_2cb639dd93_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Scarpa Stix" /></a></p>

<p>But back to fit for a moment. Once you slip into the shoe, which is easy thanks to the two large tabs at the back and the one on the instep, your large toe right away finds its spot, with the other toes falling in line. While the rubber isn’t super thin, it’s thin enough for a precise feeling of the rock underneath: With the pointy toe box you’ll find pockets without problems, while on tiny ledges you feel like you can reliably and safely weigh down on your foot and know that it will stick. If you prefer slabs (and I really do!) or the climb just has no footholds you will be glad to hear that it’s a fine shoe for smearing. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14153076640" title="Scarpa Stix by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2913/14153076640_520b2ace9f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Scarpa Stix" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14336362111" title="Scarpa Stix by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3864/14336362111_e3dbfb6566_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Scarpa Stix" /></a></p>

<p>Which brings us to toe and heel hooking. I like Scarpa shoes because they fit me so well - it sometimes feels like they were designed for my feet - and the heel cup on the Stix is no difference here. A narrow, hugging heel cup without any dead space makes it easy to do precise heel hooks, with sticky rubber going far up the heel on all sides for extra friction. Toe hooks are similar: Because of the great fit for all my toes and the rubber on top it’s comfy &amp; easy to hook with the shoe. As it’s fast to put on &amp; off it’s easy to take the shoes off between pitches or when taking a break from a boulder problem. Even on hot, sunny days the shoe is comfortable to wear and does not create hot spots or overly sweaty feet. </p>

<p>The Stix is reasonably priced for such a high-quality shoe, and using it now since five months a couple of times a week on rock and plastic it feels like they still have a lot of climbing left in them. If you’re in the market for new climbing shoes and Scarpa’s shoes fit your feet well, I’d highly encourage you to try the Stix if you’re bouldering and sports climbing. It’s a highly comfortable shoe which is lightweight with great sensitivity and support that offers grip on narrow ledges, tiny pockets and lets you walk up steep slabs in comfort.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Bouldering is the new running. You need a minimal amount of gear &amp; zero experience which equals low borders of entry, but the results are a lot of fun, getting very fit, and improving your climbing skills a lot. David Flanagan’s <a href="http://threerockbooks.com/index.php/bouldering-essentials/">Bouldering Essentials</a> helps beginners &amp; pros alike to improve technique and shares a lot of tips &amp; tricks for this wonderful sport.</p>

<p><img style="max-width:100%" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7321/12499552174_2ee2980316_b.jpg#tl-490513122839232514;1043138249" /><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="http://hendrikmorkel.github.com//cdn.thinglink.me/jse/embed.js"></script></p>

<p>I’m lucky that my <a href="http://www.highsport.fi/en">local climbing club</a> has regularly Bouldering Courses, so it was an easy choice to visit it last year. To learn from people who have bouldered for over five years means you get a lot of insights and a good grasp of what bouldering is all about, and the value of someone correcting your mistakes is invaluable. Nevertheless, I have wished I’d had David Flanagan’s <a href="http://threerockbooks.com/index.php/bouldering-essentials/">Bouldering Essentials</a> book already last year. While a course teaches you a lot, it’s nice to be able to go back a page and read about laybacking again, so you can practice it once more on that problem, and hopefully top out.</p>

<p><img style="max-width:100%" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2881/12499071825_4a71747394_b.jpg#tl-490513123501932546;1043138249" /><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="http://hendrikmorkel.github.com//cdn.thinglink.me/jse/embed.js"></script></p>

<p>The book starts off with an introduction and then explains the basics of bouldering. Two handfuls of pages on equipment and how to stay safe later David dives into movement, which is the section that holds the most value for me. Flagging, undercuts, balance, crimps &amp; heel hooking are all explained, as well as dozens more moves and techniques. Great is that every point is accompanied by a very good photo, often from inspiring locations and great climbers. With the foundations covered, David highlights the differences between indoor &amp; outdoor climbing and what to keep in mind, talks strategy &amp; training, and to top things off he takes you to the top bouldering locations across the globe (minus points for missing <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/07/southern-finland-bouldering-guide.html">Finland</a>!). It’s a well-written book that’s easy to read, and you can see that the author knows what he writes about &amp; has researched the subject in-depth.</p>

<p>No matter if you’re a beginner in the sport, boulder-curious, or a trad/ sport/ ice climber that looks to improve on his technique, anyone will take something useful away from this book. It’s small &amp; compact size means you can take it along outdoors and read up on technique and strategy,  while the superb photos that accompany the text illustrate the written words very well. The writing is short and to the point, and never boring. Highly recommended.</p>

<p>Buy it directly from <a href="http://threerockbooks.com/index.php/bouldering-essentials/">Three Rock Books</a> and support the author &amp; a small publishing house or order via <a href="http://amzn.to/1dnn2sy">Amazon.com</a>, <a href="http://amzn.to/1brIjm5">Amazon.co.uk</a>, <a href="http://amzn.to/1brInlR">Amazon.de</a> or your local bookshop.</p>

    <id>http://hendrikmorkel.github.com/2013/07/ocun-paddy-dominator-crashpad</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Do you want to fall soft, or do you want to fall hard,</strong> that is the question. Bouldering is a great sport to practice on your own - to improve your climbing skills, to get fit and to be outdoors. If you go on your own, though, you should consider taking a crashpad with you - because falling from four or more meters high could be rather painful if you land on the ground. The Ocún Paddy Dominator Crashpad ticked all boxes for my needs, and I have been very happy using it over the past months.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9192511664/" title="Ocun Paddy Dominator In use by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7416/9192511664_91b659e0d0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Ocun Paddy Dominator In use" /></a></p>

<p><em>“You look like Sponge Bob Square Pants with that pad on your back!”</em> my wife said as I came home one evening from bouldering. Well, she is right in some ways - Sponge Bob and the Ocún Paddy Dominator Crashpad both are yellow, and if the only thing you see beneath a yellow, moving rectangle are a pair of legs and feet, then yes, that connection could certainly be made. The Paddy Dominator is also soft like Sponge Bob - another similarity! But unlike the aquatic invertebrate with a porous body who lives in the ocean, the Ocún Paddy Dominator is a closed cell foam-filled crashpad, living at the foot of the boulder problem you’re tackling, catching your fall when that crimpy hold was two much for your three weak fingers.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9192458202/" title="Ocun Paddy Dominator Sponge Bob Square Pants by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7302/9192458202_79d4217d4e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Ocun Paddy Dominator Sponge Bob Square Pants" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.unterwegs.biz/ocun.html">Ocún</a>, in case you’re wondering, is Czech and translated means <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colchicum">Colchicum</a>, more commonly known as <em>autumn crocus</em>. Ocún manufacturers its products - besides crashpads they make harnesses, quickdraws, slings and more - in the Czech Republic, right in the heart of Europe, and the quality is top-notch. The <a href="http://www.unterwegs.biz/paddy-dominator-496254.html">Paddy Dominator</a> is one of six crashpads the company makes, and is their fattest pad available - perfect for Highball problems (a highball is a problem on a high boulder, where falling becomes more dangerous). </p>

<p>The Paddy Dominator is 14 cm thick, and can be configured in two ways: One square-ish which measures 100 x 132, or one more like a rectangle with a 200 x 66 measurement. The latter, btw, also is an excellent size for a mattress - indeed it does work superb as a mattress if you like to sleep on a rather hard surface. For bouldering as protection I use the square-ish, or wide configuration, 95% of the time, as it gives me a better landing zone in most cases. It usually also fits that way better in front of the rock, and is in my experience more stable. That the pad doesn’t fold together by accident you can use to Velcro straps at the bottom to fixate the pad - nifty. </p>

<p>Adjusting the pad from wide to narrow is very simple via a zipper. The two-way zipper lets you in seconds switch the configuration. So far the zipper has held up very well, and my son has been playing with it on a daily basis. It is one of the weak spots, though, so it will be interesting to see how it holds up during the years to come.</p>

<p>The Paddy Dominator is unique in a way, in that way, this way, that it has three layers of foam inside. I didn’t even need to take my puukko and cut it open to find that out, but could do so via the zipper, which gives us an insight into the inner workings of this crashpad. So three layers. White, salmon, grey. 10 mm, 110 mm, 20 mm. The surprise? The salmon layer is porous (maybe even more in common with Sponge Bob?), filled with holes, which in turn are partly filled with more grey polyethylene tubes for added support. This gives the pad in every spot superb suspension, also on the sides, as it spreads the impact force evenly on the whole crashpad. That should give it a long life, I imagine (and hope). It does make falls soft, too - even if I only fell on it from moderate heights.</p>

<p>Besides falling and sleeping on it, you will also carry the crashpad. Depending on the length of the approach, that might be longer or shorter. The Paddy Dominator has padded shoulder straps, which are comfortable. They can be removed, too, in case you prefer to use the two handles. I use the shoulder straps for the approaches, and the handles when moving from boulder to boulder in a sector if it are short walks. The pad weighs something between 5 and 6 kg - the weight of an ultralight backpack with kit - and hence is easy and comfy to carry, even on longer walks. What needs more getting used to is the massive size - it has a pack size of 66 x 100 x 28 so you will look like Sponge Bob Square Pants walking around with it. Going through doors can be a challenge, too.</p>

<p>That are the inner workings. Keeping it together is a layer of yellow Cordura Ballistic on top and a rubber-like material on the bottom. The Cordura is super durable, and even after dozens of times of jumping on it, falling on it, standing on it, does not show any abrasion. Dirt is seen easily on the yellow, obviously, but so far I could brush everything easily off and there are no stains. The rubber-like back seems waterproof, as water just perls off. It can get a bit sweaty in summer, though. Aluminium buckles keep everything in place and closed, and let you adjust the shoulder straps size. </p>

<p>Also included is a felt “door mat” on which you can clean your climbing shoes in case they get wet or dirty - which can happen in the outdoors. It stores away in a flat pocket on the crashpad, and is out and back in in seconds. Very useful for late winter days and just after a rain shower to get the shoes clean to tackle a problem, or standing around and waiting for your turn on a rock.</p>

<p><strong>Bottomline:</strong> I have used the Ocún Paddy Dominator crashpad for the last three months, a couple of evenings each week in my neighbourhood where I have been establishing new boulder problems (or rediscovering old ones, depending on whom you ask =). It was a pleasure to have the pad along, knowing that in case of a fall I’d land soft and not break my foot or worse. It’s light to carry, easy to deploy and thanks to the yellow easy to aim for when you fall! Superb cushioning, great quality, Made in Europe - if you look for a bouldering crashpad to catch you if you fall, this is it. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/sets/72157634438812611/">More photos on Flickr</a>.</p>
