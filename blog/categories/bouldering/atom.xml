    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In September I was lucky enough to visit Åland, the magical island that’s right in the middle between two of the best countries on this planet. It’s well-known for many things: Fine cycling and sea-kayaking, a rich history, pleasant weather, friendly people, tasty apples and superb bouldering. The third week of our climbing road trip through Finland we directed our trusty touring van towards Turku, drove on a ferry and enjoyed the journey to Åland, the promised island of Nordic bouldering.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15876015612" title="Christoph on Game Over, 7c by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7483/15876015612_7334e07262_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Christoph on Game Over, 7c" /></a></p>

<p>Once we arrived in Mariehamn, the capital of Åland, we made a stop at the office of <a href="http://www.visitaland.com">Visit Åland</a> to pick up maps and have a chat with our hosts. Then it was off to the calm pedestrian main street with nice shops and Cafés. People were sitting outside on terraces and as we were eating a sandwich we too shed layers until we sat there in our T-Shirts. This final leg of our journey started off well, with great weather and a gorgeous place to stay, the <a href="http://www.visitaland.com/en/services/dano-strandvillor/">Dånö Strandvillor</a> in Geta, almost at the other end of the island.</p>

<p>We drove there full of anticipation, and as we arrived at the beautiful beach villa it was even better than expected! Comfortable beds, great views, a sauna, a large kitchen and living room and even Wifi! We quickly went down to the beach to check out the sea, take a quick paddle and relax. In the evening the sauna was heated up, as it would be every evening, and we made a game plan on which sectors to visit when. </p>

<p>What follows is an introduction to the different sectors with links to their <a href="https://27crags.com">27 Crags</a> pages, though I highly recommend you to pick up the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/07/southern-finland-bouldering-guide.html">Southern Finland Bouldering Guide</a> as it covers the areas in depth.</p>

<h2 id="fgelberget">Fågelberget</h2>

<p><a href="http://27crags.com/crags/fagelberget">Fågelberget</a> is the sector that’s furthest away - about 5 km of approach. If you’re going there for the first time like us, don’t make the mistake of following the electricity lines! After a bit of a detour we arrived after an hour of walking at the Puerto Rico block which would be our basecamp. We warmed up on some of its routes and then took a look at some of the other blocks around.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15688535418" title="Puerto Rico by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8616/15688535418_279ebcf532_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Puerto Rico" /></a>

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15253794814" title="Florian on the Finnish Roof, 7b+ by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8671/15253794814_d2372a455c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Florian on the Finnish Roof, 7b+" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15690027729" title="Crimp! by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7518/15690027729_2e8b030010_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Crimp!" /></a></p>

<p>We tried some of the classics here, I did bit of theatre on a Highball, then we headed back with a stop at the roofs and then we walked out as dusk was falling. It was a mighty fine day and if it wouldn’t have been for the long approach we probably would have visited it again. Neverland was proud line that looked super high, and Florian tried the “Over the Moon” problem, a 7b Highball. Definitely an area you should visit on your bouldering visit to Åland, as even on a cloudy and windy day as we had it’s a good sector with dozens of high-class problems.</p>

<h2 id="kasviken">Kasviken</h2>

<p><a href="https://27crags.com/crags/kasviken">Kasviken</a> is the sector with the best approach: Park car responsibly next to the road, walk 2 minutes and you’re standing in front of Dodo in the centre of the sector! It’s also a sector where you really start to have fun if you climb 6c/ 7a and better, as there’s a lot of HARD problems here. There’s no shortage of 7c and up problems, most of it overhanging. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15252817094" title="Light &amp; Shadow by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7471/15252817094_7332a02ba8_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Light &amp; Shadow" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15877901405" title="Florian on Frispel ss, 7b by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8656/15877901405_02b141ac5b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Florian on Frispel ss, 7b" /></a>

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15877181852" title="Looking down the Cortizone Crack by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7567/15877181852_8848271506_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Looking down the Cortizone Crack" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15875820601" title="Christop on Slobodan Monstrovich, 7b by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7481/15875820601_57d8a45c6b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Christop on Slobodan Monstrovich, 7b" /></a></p>

<p>The location is beautiful up on a hill with well established paths and quite good landing zones. As it’s such a convenient place to go we went there twice and always met some people, but we never had to queue for a problem. There forest floor is also covered in blueberry shrubs, so a tasty &amp; healthy snack is never far away! We visited Kasviken two times and all five of us enjoyed the sector. This is definitely the sector to visit if you’re here only for a short time and don’t want to waste it on a long approach!</p>

<h2 id="grottan">Grottan</h2>

<p><a href="https://27crags.com/crags/grottan">Grottan</a>, also known as Djupviksgrottorna, was probably my favourite sector. The 2 km approach is along a super well-marked trail from the Soltuna Café - you basically walk on a nature trail there. The sector is on top of a hill with vast views and if t’s sunny you definitely want to bring enough to drink. Problems are mostly vertical and overhanging, and also here there’s a very high number of hard problems from 7b and up. Happily there were also plenty of easier boulders!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15690279358" title="On the way to Grottan by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7539/15690279358_2529fdc504_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="On the way to Grottan" /></a>

<p>Here I ticked a few nice problems and enjoyed the good atmosphere at the sector. Great views, a nice breeze to cool down, lots of autumn sun and an easy approach make this definitely the 3rd sector you should visit when on Åland for your boulder holidays! </p>

<h2 id="gunnarsklint">Gunnarsklint</h2>

<p><a href="https://27crags.com/crags/gunnarsklint">Gunnarsklint</a> seems a relatively new sector that’s also not that easy to approach. I think we were hiking for about 45 minutes through the forest until we were finally there. While there are some nice problems the area doesn’t seem to be visited that often, so you should bring a brush or two to clean the lines you want to climb. On the plus side were the nice views from the top of the hill!</p>

<h2 id="rest-days">Rest Days</h2>

<p>As you can’t climb every day hard we had a rest day, too. We visited an old ruin, went sea kayaking, played Mini Golf, went grocery shopping and simply relaxed in our fine house. Sauna, star gazing, eating, enjoying the stillness of the island - Åland is a gorgeous place and it would be easy to spend more than a week here and never get bored. There’s so much to see and try that it definitely is worth a visit, even if you don’t boulder!</p>

<h2 id="thanks">Thanks</h2>

<p>This road trip wouldn’t have been possible without the support of many companies whom we’d like to thank for their support.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.visitaland.com">Visit Åland</a> arranged for us accommodation in the beautiful <a href="http://www.visitaland.com/en/services/dano-strandvillor/">Dånö Strandvillor</a> which we loved. When you go to Åland you can find ALL accommodation options on the <a href="http://www.visitaland.com/en/service_category/cottages-cottage-villages/">Visit Åland Cottages &amp; Holiday Villages</a>, <a href="http://www.visitaland.com/en/service_category/hotels/">Hotels</a> and <a href="http://www.visitaland.com/en/service_category/bed-breakfast-hostels/">B&amp;B</a> pages. There’s also <a href="http://www.visitaland.com/en/service_category/campsites/">campsites</a> if you prefer these. </p>

<p>A car is essential if you want to go on a road trip and travel on the Åland islands (although there are also busses there!). If you want to hire a car in Finland look no further than <a href="http://www.finnrent.fi/en/frontpage/">Finn-Rent</a>. They’re hands down the best place to rent a car with friendly service, competitive prices and great cars. We hired an <a href="http://www.finnrent.fi/en/category/minibuses/">Opel Vivaro Minibus</a> which carried all our gear, four crashpads and five persons in comfort and style. It also was super gas efficient and we drove over 1500 km on one tank load!</p>

<p>We got to Åland and back to Finland with <a href="http://www.sales.vikingline.com">Viking Line</a> and were especially lucky to be on the <a href="http://www.vikingline.fi/vikinggrace">M/S Viking Grace</a> on the way back which was a modern and beautiful ship. We enjoyed lounging on the comfy sofas and enjoyed the views from deck, and it was fast &amp; punctual, too!</p>

<p>We were very happy to visit <a href="http://www.boulderkeskus.com/fi/">Boulderkeskus Isatis</a> and enjoyed climbing there on our stops in Helsinki. It’s a great climbing gym with a well-sorted shop, Café and a cool gym to work out. You even can do yoga there and go to the sauna!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15690299018" title="Freddy on Angel, 6b+ by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7575/15690299018_d82686c413_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Freddy on Angel, 6b+" /></a></p>

<p>Gear-wise we had support from <a href="http://vandernet.fi/petzl">Petzl</a> and <a href="http://vandernet.fi/sport.php?k=16273">Jetboil</a> with a crashpad, rope and stove as well as crashpads from <a href="http://www.madrockclimbing.com">Mad Rock</a> via <a href="http://www.nihilclimbing.com">Nihil</a>. Without the crashpads there would have been no bouldering (or more broken ankles, which ain’t helpful on a boulder holiday) and the rope was very useful on our visits to some of the sports and trad crags. The Jetboil Joule boiled water for noodles and drinks in no time in group-sized measures. </p>

<p>In Vaasa we joined a day out bouldering with my climbing club <a href="http://www.highsport.fi">High Sport</a> and you can join them too for the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/756649124396284/">Vaasa BoulderFest 2015</a> which promises to be awesome. Vaasa offers some superb bouldering and there’s a dozen sectors with hundreds of problems within 10 km of the city centre!</p>

<p>Finally, my thanks to Christoph, Florian, Freddy and Nico who came here to climb! It was a pleasure to host you four and I’m looking forward to climb and boulder with you soon again. Also make sure to check our Nico’s photos on <a href="http://vertical-axis.de">Vertical Axis</a> as he’s a very talented photographer with a great eye &amp; vision and I certainly learned a thing or two from him.</p>

<p>As usually, you can see more photos in the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/sets/72157647589227685">Åland Album on Flickr</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Romania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Greece and Turkey are host to the 2014 Petzl RocTrip which this year takes the form of a road trip. Come and join this great event and hang out with the likes of <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/08/ueli-steck-interview.html">Ueli Steck</a>, Saïd Belhaj, Dave Graham, Mélissa Le Nevé, Nina Caprez and many more while exploring the crazy good climbing that can be had in Eastern Europe!</p>

<p>The first time I became aware of the <a href="http://www.petzl-roctrip.com/en">Petzl RocTrip</a> was in 2011, when I saw some photos from the event in China. Then in 2012 the video of the event was published and it was mind-blowing. I still love to watch it, and if you have a moment watch it here.</p>

<iframe width="1280" height="720" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//www.youtube.com/embed/EcU255XBlcI?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>In 2013 the Petzl RocTrip traveled to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QllWNEGBKic">Argentina</a> and it was equally inspiring. In 2013 it returned closer to home to the Gorges du Tarn, and now in 2014 the event is back and takes a new, unique format: A road trip across five countries in Eastern Europe. This is a great idea on so many levels, as it promotes what climbing is about in many ways: Travel to new crags, explore new countries, meet new people, climb new types of rock, experience different cultures. In a way it is promoting the dirtbag lifestyle, in a slightly more comfortable way! The teaser sets the mood well:</p>

<iframe src="http://hikinginfinland.com//player.vimeo.com/video/92311979?byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>What is special about the RocTrip are the low costs for taking part in the event: It’s just 15€! Comparing that to the costs of some other events this is <em>very affordable</em>. It’s well organized (<a href="http://www.petzl-roctrip.com/en/practical-information">check the practical information</a>) and you get the opportunity to climb in some unique locations with members of the <a href="http://www.petzl-roctrip.com/en/news/spend-time-your-favorite-athletes-during-2014-petzl-roctrip">Petzl Pro Team</a>. </p>

<p>Interested? Then <a href="http://www.petzl-roctrip.com/en/join-us">pre-register until August 31th, 2014</a> to one (or all!) of the camps you would like to join. <a href="http://www.petzl-roctrip.com/en/practical-information#Transport">Organize your transportation</a>, for example join the carpool or get a ride in the Petzl bus. Book your flights (I’m flying to Antalya which is a smooth connection if flying from Helsinki, Stockholm or Oslo).

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lacking <em>Kraft</em> to do your project or carry your UH pack? Then <a href="http://gimmekraft.com/">Gimme Kraft</a> is the book that helps you develop the power you need to send your next problem.</p>

<p><img style="max-width:100%" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3890/14385371581_1329c62e2d_b.jpg#tl-532816872920317954;1043138249" class="alwaysThinglink" /><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//cdn.thinglink.me/jse/embed.js"></script></p>

<p><em>Kraft, die [kraft]: Vermögen, Fähigkeit zu wirken; [körperliche oder geistige] Stärke</em> / <em>Kraft is German for power, force, strength</em></p>

<p><strong>It’s not about power, it’s about technique</strong> was my bouldering teachers opening line to our group of eager students. And seeing him - a thin and tall guy - climb several rounds upside down in our boulder cave, it’s easy to agree. We went on to learn proper boulder technique, first indoors, then took it to the rocks of Vaasa. But of course some Kraft does help, especially if you already have a good technique. However, Kraft does not magically appear from going climbing - that much I have learned in the three odd years since I have rekindled my passion for the art. Kraft comes from training. Being dedicated in developing a training routine, sticking to it and mixing it up as needed, that’s what this fine book from one of Germany’s best climbing gyms, <a href="http://cafekraft.de/">Café Kraft</a> helps you do. </p>

<p>When you pick up the book you realize that here people were writing who know what they’re talking about. The authors have worked with athletes like Alex Megos, Mayan Smith-Gobat, Stefan Glowacz, Sasha DiGiulian and many more, and have sat down to write this fine training book. It’s bi-lingual in English and Deutsch and comes with a DVD where the exercises can be viewed, as well as extra footage of Wolfgang Güllich training. The book starts out with an introduction to effective climbing training - you get a password to download the full 16 page introduction pdf online - and then sets out with dozens of exercises. The exercises are divided into different categories, like the Bouldering Wall, Pull-Ups, Rings, Floor &amp; Minibars, amongst others.</p>

<p><img style="max-width:100%" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2908/14202091729_e331c948dd_b.jpg#tl-532816872635105282;1043138249" class="alwaysThinglink" /><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//cdn.thinglink.me/jse/embed.js"></script></p>

<p>This really being the first time I set out to train (apart from many years of Kenjutsu) I adhered to the books tips to do most of my training as climbing. In the Bouldering Wall chapter there’s several good exercises which not just train you, but also help you to improve your technique. At home I do the floor exercises and train on the two <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/metolius-rock-rings-3d-trainingsgriffe/">Metolius Rock Rings</a>, though I will need to switch the exercises up soon (the book recommends you change up your training routine at the latest every six weeks as otherwise you’re stagnating). I definitely have seen an increase in power, stamina and also feel like I climb better since I started to work out, and as the book is small and light I also usually carry it along to the boulders to see if there’s a new exercise I could try. </p>

<p>One critic I have about the book it’s that they put the video instructions on a DVD. Living in a household without TV (and DVD Player) and also all our computers being without DVD Drives, I have no opportunity to watch the videos. I’d rather would have seen the videos being available online to stream or download, which makes a lot more sense than a DVD. </p>

<p>Other than that this book really is great, and not just for climbers - though they obviously will benefit the most from reading it and doing the exercises. If you’d like to get more Kraft, get this book, make a personal training plan, stick to it, and see how your climbing and power will improve. Then take it out to the rocks and send your project!</p>

<p>You can order the book online at <a href="http://cafekraft.de/laden/produkte/GK">Café Kraft</a> and <a href="http://shop.boulderkeskus.com/fi/kauppa/muut/kirjallisuus/gimmekraft.html">Boulderkeskus</a> and with some luck buy it at your local climbing gym. </p>

    <updated>2014-06-03T13:20:00+03:00</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Climbing shoes. Like other <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/shoes/">shoes</a> they can be a source of much discussion. The <a href="http://www.scarpa.net/en/stix.html">Scarpa Stix</a> was popular long before I started climbing, was shelved and now makes a return - and it’s easy to feel when climbing with it why this shoe was and is so popular.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14359890633" title="Scarpa Stix by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3857/14359890633_7b1bf6b62b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Scarpa Stix" /></a></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I like Scarpa’s climbing shoes. The <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2011/08/ultralight-climbing.html">Feroce</a> still gets regularly used on rock and plastic, though since I got the Stix late in 2013 it has been my climbing shoe of choice. There’s much to like about the shoe: There’s the weight of just 402 g for the pair in Size 41, the sticky rubber and the precise feel. One thing which really rules for me is that they’re quick and easy to put on and take off. With the Feroce I had three Velcro straps to open and close and the <a href="http://www.scarpa.net/en/techno-x.html">Techno X</a> uses laces. The Stix uses neither - it’s a slipper that hugs my foot for a wonderful snug fit without being constricting or uncomfortable. In case you’re wondering if it easy to lose the shoe - for example when heel or toe hooking: Nope, no chance. The Stix fits like a glove and doesn’t budge.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14153208177" title="Scarpa Stix by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3914/14153208177_215c9320e1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Scarpa Stix" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14153085520" title="Scarpa Stix by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5477/14153085520_d4f50c85cd_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Scarpa Stix" /></a></p>

<p>Much of that superb fit can be attributed to Heinz Mariacher who designed the Stix - a name very closely connected to high-quality climbing shoes. And this shoe does pack a few high-quality features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <em>Vibram® XS Grip 2</em> sole gives grip on rock and plastic alike</li>
  <li>The <em>X-Tension Randing</em> cradles your foot and heel to enhance your toe power</li>
  <li><em>REB - Reinforced Elastic Band</em> are the blue stripes on top of the shoe which improve the fit of the shoe</li>
  <li>Superb craftsmanship and construction</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14316563156" title="Scarpa Stix by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5526/14316563156_2cb639dd93_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Scarpa Stix" /></a></p>

<p>But back to fit for a moment. Once you slip into the shoe, which is easy thanks to the two large tabs at the back and the one on the instep, your large toe right away finds its spot, with the other toes falling in line. While the rubber isn’t super thin, it’s thin enough for a precise feeling of the rock underneath: With the pointy toe box you’ll find pockets without problems, while on tiny ledges you feel like you can reliably and safely weigh down on your foot and know that it will stick. If you prefer slabs (and I really do!) or the climb just has no footholds you will be glad to hear that it’s a fine shoe for smearing. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14153076640" title="Scarpa Stix by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2913/14153076640_520b2ace9f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Scarpa Stix" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14336362111" title="Scarpa Stix by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3864/14336362111_e3dbfb6566_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Scarpa Stix" /></a></p>

<p>Which brings us to toe and heel hooking. I like Scarpa shoes because they fit me so well - it sometimes feels like they were designed for my feet - and the heel cup on the Stix is no difference here. A narrow, hugging heel cup without any dead space makes it easy to do precise heel hooks, with sticky rubber going far up the heel on all sides for extra friction. Toe hooks are similar: Because of the great fit for all my toes and the rubber on top it’s comfy &amp; easy to hook with the shoe. As it’s fast to put on &amp; off it’s easy to take the shoes off between pitches or when taking a break from a boulder problem. Even on hot, sunny days the shoe is comfortable to wear and does not create hot spots or overly sweaty feet. </p>

<p>The Stix is reasonably priced for such a high-quality shoe, and using it now since five months a couple of times a week on rock and plastic it feels like they still have a lot of climbing left in them. If you’re in the market for new climbing shoes and Scarpa’s shoes fit your feet well, I’d highly encourage you to try the Stix if you’re bouldering and sports climbing. It’s a highly comfortable shoe which is lightweight with great sensitivity and support that offers grip on narrow ledges, tiny pockets and lets you walk up steep slabs in comfort.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Bouldering is the new running. You need a minimal amount of gear &amp; zero experience which equals low borders of entry, but the results are a lot of fun, getting very fit, and improving your climbing skills a lot. David Flanagan’s <a href="http://threerockbooks.com/index.php/bouldering-essentials/">Bouldering Essentials</a> helps beginners &amp; pros alike to improve technique and shares a lot of tips &amp; tricks for this wonderful sport.</p>

<p><img style="max-width:100%" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7321/12499552174_2ee2980316_b.jpg#tl-490513122839232514;1043138249" /><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//cdn.thinglink.me/jse/embed.js"></script></p>

<p>I’m lucky that my <a href="http://www.highsport.fi/en">local climbing club</a> has regularly Bouldering Courses, so it was an easy choice to visit it last year. To learn from people who have bouldered for over five years means you get a lot of insights and a good grasp of what bouldering is all about, and the value of someone correcting your mistakes is invaluable. Nevertheless, I have wished I’d had David Flanagan’s <a href="http://threerockbooks.com/index.php/bouldering-essentials/">Bouldering Essentials</a> book already last year. While a course teaches you a lot, it’s nice to be able to go back a page and read about laybacking again, so you can practice it once more on that problem, and hopefully top out.</p>

<p><img style="max-width:100%" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2881/12499071825_4a71747394_b.jpg#tl-490513123501932546;1043138249" /><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//cdn.thinglink.me/jse/embed.js"></script></p>

<p>The book starts off with an introduction and then explains the basics of bouldering. Two handfuls of pages on equipment and how to stay safe later David dives into movement, which is the section that holds the most value for me. Flagging, undercuts, balance, crimps &amp; heel hooking are all explained, as well as dozens more moves and techniques. Great is that every point is accompanied by a very good photo, often from inspiring locations and great climbers. With the foundations covered, David highlights the differences between indoor &amp; outdoor climbing and what to keep in mind, talks strategy &amp; training, and to top things off he takes you to the top bouldering locations across the globe (minus points for missing <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/07/southern-finland-bouldering-guide.html">Finland</a>!). It’s a well-written book that’s easy to read, and you can see that the author knows what he writes about &amp; has researched the subject in-depth.</p>

<p>No matter if you’re a beginner in the sport, boulder-curious, or a trad/ sport/ ice climber that looks to improve on his technique, anyone will take something useful away from this book. It’s small &amp; compact size means you can take it along outdoors and read up on technique and strategy,  while the superb photos that accompany the text illustrate the written words very well. The writing is short and to the point, and never boring. Highly recommended.</p>

<p>Buy it directly from <a href="http://threerockbooks.com/index.php/bouldering-essentials/">Three Rock Books</a> and support the author &amp; a small publishing house or order via <a href="http://amzn.to/1dnn2sy">Amazon.com</a>, <a href="http://amzn.to/1brIjm5">Amazon.co.uk</a>, <a href="http://amzn.to/1brInlR">Amazon.de</a> or your local bookshop.</p>
