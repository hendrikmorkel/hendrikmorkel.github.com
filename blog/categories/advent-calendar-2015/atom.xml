<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>It is not just always backpacking á la backpacking in the forests and hills. Sometimes it is also backpacking á la backpacking from city to town to village, travelling on busses, trains and richa taxis. And for that a durable pack like the <a href="https://www.hanchor.com/products/Travel%20Series/Breccia_Travel_Backpack?locale=en">Breccia Travel Backpack</a> from <a href="https://www.hanchor.com/">HANCHOR</a> is an ideal choice. It has a carry-on size which makes it excellent for an ultralight approach to travelling, and the durable &amp; waterproof construction makes it suitable for backpacking in Central America during the rain season and scrambling in Utah’s canyons in the summer. It can be expanded with modular pockets for any occasion - from a short business city travel trip to a long backpacking tour around the world. It also works great for hiking, carrying climbing gear to the crag or carry photo equipment to the next shoot - a true multi-use beast that is ideal for the ultralight traveller.</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>staying warm in winter - it’s something we Northern people know about. Hailing from Canada <a href="http://arcteryx.com/">Arc’teryx</a> belongs to the illustrious circle of companies which know how to keep alpinists, skiers and backpackers warm when the temperatures drop below 0°C. Their <a href="http://arcteryx.com/product.aspx?language=EN&amp;gender=mens&amp;model=Atom-LT-Hoody">Atom LT Hoody</a> is not just one of their most popular midlayer insulation pieces which is great when cold wind howls through the mountains &amp; tundra, it also works well on its own when it is not freezing cold. Coreloft™ insulation in the torso, arms and hood keep one toasty, and the side panels of Polartec® Power Stretch® with Hardface® Technology add breathability and stretchiness. And when the sun comes out, it packs small and light in the pack - excellent for a winter day out in the hills!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>watching the sun rise in the mountains - is there anything better? Not really. With the new <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=13582&amp;pw=73183&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hyperlitemountaingear.com%2Ffeatured-ultralight-packs%2Fdaybreak-pack.html">Daybreak Pack</a> from <a href="http://bit.ly/1QQRFL2">Hyperlite Mountain Gear</a> I always have all I need along for a day in the hills. It has side pockets for my water bottles, the possibility to attach an ice axe and a back pocket with additional bungees to easily access rain gear or a puffy jacket. Made from Dyneema® Cuben Fiber it takes the abuse of scrambling in the mountains and bushwhacking through the forests, and at 539 g it is so light you can carry it all day long. And if you consider that it’s made in Maine, USA, you know it is a quality piece of gear that is gonna last many, many years!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>with snow on the ground there is no reason to hike or cycle - snow means it is time to ski. And the <a href="http://skinbased.com/5/">WAP 127</a> from <a href="http://www.oacsport.fi">OAC</a> is the perfect tool to ski - from home to the cabin, up the hills and down the slopes. Best thing: I don’t even need to get expensive ski boots, as I can use my normal winter boots thanks to the <a href="http://skinbased.com/10/">OAC EA Binding</a> where I can step in with my winter boots or trailrunners alike and go to the fjells. The patented Unicoat base structure of the WAP 127 allows me to climb steep hills and have great grip on any snow. And at just 1.050 g they’re lighter than many snowshoes - and a lot faster and more fun, too! With these winter will be a lot of fun, so please bring me a pair! </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="http://skinbased.com/5/" title="OAC WAP 127"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/619/23345928911_d49f8d737f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="OAC WAP 127" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>While I’m Opting to be Outside, sometimes litte things are needed to make them more comfortable. Be that a stove to brew a hot cup of tea or a warm beanie, small things make being outside more fun and pleasurable. The focus, however, is always on being outside, and not the gear. Sure you need it, but it’s not the reason to go out. That is to relax, be inspired, spend times with family &amp; good friends and enjoying the beautiful nature. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16888796258/in/album-72157651506091295/" title="Fatbiking over the mires"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7668/16888796258_73067eb837_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Fatbiking over the mires" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>With that said, some warm down gear does help to make cold winter hikes more fun. Damn, even sitting in a wooden hut is made better with some down around your feet. The <a href="https://goosefeetgear.com/products/1-down-socks">Down Socks</a> from Goose Feet Gear not only ensure that toes are toasty, they make it possible to dry my trailrunners by the fire so they’re ready for next days hike. And if you have cold feet in your quilt - these Down Socks ensure you wake up with warm feet!</p>

<p>Also <a href="https://www.blackrockgear.com/product/test/">The Original Black Rock Gear Down Beanie</a> is filled with 950 cuin Hungarian Down and ensures a warm head when the wind is blowing in sub-zero temperatures. Hiking with cold ears is so last year, thus a Black Rock Hat is not only keeping the ears warm but also is <em>trés chic</em>! Did I mention it is ultralight? Of course it is!</p>

<p>Feet and head being cared for, that leaves the hands as the third extremities which tend to not like to much snow, wind and cold. And it just so happens that the <a href="http://www.mountainlaureldesigns.com/shop/product_info.php?cPath=37&amp;products_id=51">Mountain Laurel Designs eVent Mitts</a> are not just excellent to keep the rain of my hands, they also work great in winter! Cold wind and snow won’t trouble you anymore with these ultralight gloves on your hands.</p>

<p>When you do take the gloves off, it often is to boil water for a hot cup of tea. The <a href="https://www.traildesigns.com/stoves/caldera-sidewinder-solo">Caldera Sidewinder Solo</a> is not just a very great stove system, with the 1,1 litre pot you can even boil water for your mates so that everyone has a warm cup of tea! It all packs compactly into the pot and is fuel-efficient, thus a great choice for ultralight outdoor enthusiasts.</p>

<p>That leaves a warm coat for those cold temperatures. Or a toasty pair of trousers. Long underwear. Warm winter shoes. Well, sometimes you’re missing one piece of gear, and that’s where the 50€ Gift Card from <a href="https://www.bergzeit.co.uk/?pid=81/">Bergzeit.co.uk</a> comes in very useful. With it you can save a nice amount of cash on your next big purchase - be that a Merino Baselayer or your new AT skis, Bergzeit.co.uk has it all. </p>
