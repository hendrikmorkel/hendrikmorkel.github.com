    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Högakustenleden - or High Coast Trail in English - is a new trail that passes through the UNESCO World Heritage site of the same name. The scenic trail passes through villages &amp; towns, along the coast, through the forest and a beautiful National Park and if you have a free week makes for a great walk along the Swedish coastal hills.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16034082038" title="Jon Nils Berget is the highest point on the trail by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7571/16034082038_6e226a048a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Jon Nils Berget is the highest point on the trail" /></a></p>

<p>November marks usually the last month of the year where I go out on a Press Trip to do research for <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/magazines/">magazine</a> articles. It’s far from the perfect backpacking month in the North and I had planned to hike the High Coast Trail in August, but changes in schedules meant it’d be the final backpacking trip of the year. Happily my good friend Martin agreed to accompany me, and so we met up late on a Sunday night in a <a href="http://umea.kfum.se">Hostel in Umeå</a>, him after flying in, me after taking the <a href="http://www.wasaline.com">ferry from Vaasa</a>. The next morning we enjoyed the breakfast at the Hostel and walked to the bus station from where we had a comfortable and fast bus ride to the bus stop at Hornöberget just before the High Coast Bridge, the start point of the trail. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16221689035" title="Start at the High Coast Bridge in Hornöberget by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7551/16221689035_e5fb4a7ab7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Start at the High Coast Bridge in Hornöberget" /></a></p>

<p>We followed the street for a bit, took to a forest road and soon saw our first Högakustenleden trail marker and were on a proper trail. It was a short one, though, because the next several kilometres took us along on village roads, along the street, across bridges until we finally walked along the Baltic Sea and came upon a proper trail into the forest. It wasn’t all pleasurable forest trails, though, we also passed a few deforested areas until we finally reached Sör-Lövvik, the end of section 1. The <a href="http://lovvikbedandbreakfast.se">Lövvik B&amp;B</a> looked inviting just along the trail, and while it was still early in the day we somehow wouldn’t have minded to stop there or at the free cottage in the village, but as it was closed for the winter we just continued until Fjärdbotten.</p>

<p>We hiked for a while along the road and then took a turn onto a forest path. We found a stream to refill our water bottles and continued until the Laavu at Halsviken Bay. The place looked nice, and with dusk upon us we yet again were tempted to put the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/09/hyperlite-mountain-gear-ultamid.html">HMG UltaMid</a> up for the night. We resisted the early finish and continued on the trail, which then went through a boulder field along the shore. Sleet from the sky, strong winds and spray from the sea make walking on boulders a pleasurable past time, which only can be improved by onsetting darkness. We somehow managed to no break any feet or legs and were rather happy as we reached the forest road and road to Fjärdbotten. It was dark and raining as we arrived there, not knowing what to expect. </p>

<p>Fjärdbotten was a great camping place. Around six wooden cottages with tables, benches, beds and some with a stove in them were too good a chance to pass up. Martin quickly put a clothes line up, we hang our wet gear up to dry, got a fire started and then the <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/primus-eta-lite-gaskocher/">Primus Lite+</a> came out and boiled us hot water for dinners and Minttu Kakaos! Well fed we soon dived into our sleeping bags and had a good night’s sleep. </p>

<p>The next morning was drizzly but looked like it might clear up. After we explored the Fjärdbotten summer farm and checked out the other cottages and got water from the well we had a warm breakfast &amp; coffee, boiled water for our <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2012/11/thermos-bottle.html">Thermos</a> and then soon were out on the trail again. The decision to stay at Fjärdbotten was a good one, and it was a very nice place.</p>

<p>The next section took us on the highest point along the trail, Jon Nils Berget. We were lucky as the drizzle from the morning stopped after a few kilometres of hiking and we were treated by one of those fine, sunny days which you get after a night of rain. The trail was a mix of nice forest roads (they’re great to walk and talk on with a party of two!) where abandoned caravans were every few kilometres. As we reached Jon Nils Berget the sun came out and we really enjoyed this beautiful moment. </p>

<p>We had a quick tea and cookies break at the Nipstugan on Lidenipan, and the sun just continued to treat us with warmth and light on the way to Gavik, the end of the 3rd Section. Behind Gavik we hiked on a forest road along summer cottages which had been closed up for winter, and had a very late lunch as the sun was just setting somewhere in the West. Soon the headlamps came on as we hiked on dark and wet forest trails and snowy forest roads.</p>

<p>The goal of Section 4 was Lappuden, which was hailed as <em>the</em> camping spot along the Högakustenleden. Well, it was not. As it was closed. Closed up for winter. After the luxury of the Fjärdbotten hut we were going to sleep outside, and as the lake and grass fields already were covered with thin ice we knew we’d be in for a cold night. Alas, not even a fire we were able to lighten up, for a lack of wood and a fire place. We still had a good night, even if my <a href="http://www.phdesigns.co.uk">PHD Minix Sleeping Bag</a> was a tad too less insulation for these temperatures. The next morning the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/10/garmin-fenix.html">fēnix</a> said -3°C and we packed up while the Lite+ boiled water for breakfast &amp; coffee. We were early on the trail again, and we were happy to leave the disappointment of Lappuden behind.</p>

<p>The trail was again a mix of enjoyable forest trails, OK forest roads and less enjoyable asphalt streets, but happily the trails made up the majority os Section 5 to Ullånger. The highlight for Martin and me was the beautiful Erikskojan hut high up in the middle of the forest. It stood lonely there, and if I hadn’t pulled like someone who really wants to sit inside with his tea we probably would have drunk our hot tea on its steps as the door was very tightly closed =) Of all the huts we passed this was the one we both really would have loved to stay in for the night, as it was cozy and comfortable. Alas, we needed to continue onwards.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16195558186" title="Lovely deforestation views by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7568/16195558186_41f1ab48d3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Lovely deforestation views" /></a></p>

<p>As we hiked into Ullånger it was still lunch time, and we didn’t need long to decide on the Värdshuset Restaurang Snäckan to get our business. A Lunch Buffet is a Hiker’s dream, and tasty Swedish food was consumed in large amounts, topped off with coffee and cookies. It was fortunate that we didn’t need to hike a long distance to our next camping place, the Gårdberget Stugan just above Ullånger. We didn’t really know what to expect, but were delighted by the hut, which was decorated in a 70s style and had a big stove inside. A fire was roaring quickly while night fell, and we enjoyed the evening by talking and drinking a good Whisky.</p>

<p>The night over a powdery coat of snow covered the land and we enjoyed the walk in the morning through the silent forest. That silence was interrupted the closer we got to Sjöland and Skoved as the trail went along the highway. It was an interesting experience to hike with trucks and cars passing by at high speeds, and I do hope that the trail finds a different route in the future.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16262738312" title="Church door by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7555/16262738312_90e05236cb_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Church door" /></a>

<p>We flew through Section 7 from Skoved to Skuleberget and the <a href="http://www.naturumhogakusten.se/">Naturum Höga Kusten</a> Centre. Sadly the Museum also was closed, and as we still had well over 15 km before us we also didn’t take the detour over the top of the Skuleberget. The hill was impressive, though, and it’s nice to see that local entrepreneurs have installed Via Ferratas on it. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15643755233" title="Naturum Höga Kusten by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7561/15643755233_c0fd06d8dd_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Naturum Höga Kusten" /></a>

<p>Section 8 from Skuleberget to the Skuleberget National Park South Entry must have been one of the most frustrating ones on the trail. After the Naturum Höga Kusten Centre we had another quick lunch break outside and then followed the nice Kids Adventure/ Robber Trail, passed an Open Air Theatre and then crossed the highway once more to hike on trails and forest roads to the South Entry of the National Park. Some sections of the trail were flooded and it was impossible to keep your feet dry, which usually doesn’t bother me at all, but somehow that day it really annoyed me a lot. The trail wasn’t fun in the wet dirt &amp; mud, but happily I recovered as soon as the trail became dry again. As we came closer and closer to the Skuleberget National Park the better our moods got, and the view from the South Entry was indeed well worth coming there.</p>

<p>As frustrating as that wet part of the trail previously was, so wonderful was the <a href="http://www.sverigesnationalparker.se/skuleskogen#.VLUOe8bJhJc">Skuleskogen National Park</a>. The National Park probably was the highlight of our trip, and we were a bit sad that we spend only such a short time in day light in it. We hiked on duck boards for kilometres, passed waterfalls and then hiked up to the impressive Slåttdalsskrevan, a 200 m long, 40 m deep and 7 m wide crevice. We explored it in the shine of our headlamps and then made us on the way down to the Tärnättvattnen Stuga in the middle of the National Park. </p>

<p>The hut was gorgeous from the inside and outside, though as it often happens with such huts, they seem to accumulate rubbish and trinkets which previous visitors <em>left for others to enjoy</em> or simply <em>forgot</em>. We cleaned up, got a fire started and enjoyed the evening with the a <em>Feierabendbier</em> which we carried all the way from the Supermarket in Docksta till here to enjoy in this rustic hut. The next morning grey clouds still hung thickly in the sky and the sun wasn’t to be seen. We brought some more wood for the next visitors to the hut, cleaned up and packed and where on our way again.</p>

<p>The way out of the National Park was again very beautiful, along frozen lakes, via Duckboards over swamps, over small streams and soft forest trails until the North Entry.</p>

<p>It was noon as we arrived in Köpmanholmen, and as every good tourist hiker does we immediately located the local Pizzeria and ordered their lunch Pizza. 60 SEK for a Pizza, salad, drink and coffee is a real bargain, especially considering that the Pizzas were about 40 cm (!) in diameter. We were stuffed as we walked out of the village and walked on a sandy road until the where we would enter the Balesudden Nature Reserve. It was a very beautiful reserve and not even a kilometre from the start of the forest trail we passed the prettiest Laavu on the whole Högakustenleden, up on the hill overlooking the Baltic Sea. Again we regretted that we needed to push on and couldn’t stay here, as the view and atmosphere was gorgeous.</p>

<p>Instead we pushed on through on and up through the Balesudden Nature Reserve, though with dusk coming upon us and a light drizzle we had our eyes mostly on the slippery trail in front of us. We passed a nice fireplace and camping spot near a bay until we happened upon the Bodviken Stugan, our hut for the night. The drizzle had become rain and I was happy as Martin offered to go chop the wood. I started the fire and rolled out my sleeping bag and <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/therm-a-rest-neoair-xlite.html">mattress</a> and again fired up the Primus Lite+. Soon we were well fed and had a whisky in our cups, which ensured we had another good, relaxed and warm night.</p>

<p>In winter you can sleep long and still catch the sunrise. So after we had breakfast I took a little stroll around the hut to photograph the sunrise. It was just a brief moment where one could spot the sun, as it passed up from the sea to hide again behind the clouds. It was our last day on the trail, and we only had 21 km till Örnsköldsvik, with the last part in civilization, so that we took it easy. We passed a few more Laavus in the morning, hiked on forest roads and streets, up hills and had a quick break in the Småtjärnstugan, and then were very quickly in Svedje, the end of Section 12. </p>

<p>From here we passed through the town and climbed the local recreation area. As it was windy, 0°C and grey we just marched on towards Örnsköldsvik, the end of Section 13 of the Högakustenleden. Early in the afternoon we reached town. Done.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16076823010" title="Örnskoldvik by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7566/16076823010_6ce886089b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Örnskoldvik" /></a>

<p>While standing on the square in the centre a young Swede came talking to us, who recognized me as <em>the writer of Hiking in Finland</em>. It was a fun coincidence as he said he saw that we’d be hiking the trail that week and he met us just as we finished! Very cool! After inquiring about a good place to eat in the evening we walked to our hostel, <a href="http://www.vindarnashus.se">Vindarnas Hus</a>. It was a nice &amp; quiet hostel with Wifi, hot showers and good beds, and we chilled there in the evening until we headed out to eat at <a href="http://www.bishopsarms.com/Ornskoldsvik">The Bishops Arms</a> which not only had superb food but also impeccable service and great beers. It was a worthy finish to a great Högakustenleden thru-hike!</p>

<p>The funniest thing about the Högakustenleden was for Martin and me how the distances were way off from what the signs and the guide booklet said. It makes me wonder if the trail is actually hiked by the people who planned it and if they made the effort to check the distance, or if these were just made via some mapping tool. Because the Högakustenleden is supposed to be 128,6 km from Hornöberget to Örnsköldsvik, but I tracked with my <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/10/garmin-fenix.html">Garmin fēnix</a> 141,8 km in the six days we hiked it. This isn’t uncommon and I regularly hike trails and sections which are longer/ shorter than they’re claimed to be, but still is something to keep in mind when you plan to hike the trail. </p>

<p>Also important to know is that the trail goes quite a bit along forest roads and streets. It does feel like at least 50% of the trail makes use of such infrastructure, and while it can make for fast hiking (5 km an hour and easy to chat while walking next to each other) it isn’t really very inspiring. Happily there are enough of nice forest trails, too, and the section through the Skuleskogen National Park was gorgeous. If you have time I’d recommend planning a day to just explore the National Park and then hike on.</p>

<p>Plan the travel there and back via <a href="http://reseplanerare.resrobot.se/bin/help.exe/sn?L=vs_resrobot&amp;tpl=webapp">Resrobot</a>, one of the best travel apps I have used. It helps you to find the best Bus/ Train/ Flight connections from e.g. Stockholm to Hornöberget and Örnsköldsvik and also lets you book the tickets right away. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.visitsweden.com/sweden/">Visit Sweden</a> and the <a href="http://www.hogakustenleden.com">Högakustenleden</a> + <a href="http://hogakusten.com/en/hk/high-coast-trail.html">High Coast Trail</a> websites offer a host of information about Sweden and the trail, especially the last page has a great overview map and a description of each section. You can order from there also the useful <a href="http://hogakusten.com/information/en/brochures.html">Trail Guide</a>, though don’t bother with the (free) map as it’s too large a scale to be useful for hiking. Speaking of maps, you really can hike it just with the maps in the Trail Guide. The trail is exceptionally well marked and so very beginner-friendly, sometimes every third tree has an orange dot or stripe. </p>

<p>We slept every night in one of the free huts or Laavus and were completely alone on the trail, we once encountered day hikers. But then we were hiking in November, so in the spring, summer and autumn that could look very differently. I recommend you take a <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/gear-reviews/">shelter</a> along when hiking in those months, or make use of the various accommodation options along the trail. Basic ultralight gear choices would suit the trail well, you can practice pitching tarps and sleeping with a quilt here very well as you could always head to one of the Laavus or Huts. From Ullånger on you almost daily would pass a village with a supermarket, Café and Restaurant, so you could easily resupply along the trail (or buy a Swedish Beer for the evening each day =).</p>

<p>Along the trail you also could easily go packrafting, sea kayaking, climbing and Via Ferrata. While you could do some of these activities just besides the trail you’d need to plan an extra day for some others. Because of the good infrastructure (huts &amp; Laavus, Restaurants and Shops along the way) the trail could be a good choice for families who want to try backpacking with their kids. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14057561889" title="Sca Fell camp by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5117/14057561889_18ae743375_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Sca Fell camp" /></a></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>After a calm night I wake up, have breakfast and smile because the sun is shining as I head up towards Sca Fell.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14112337924" title="Breakfast on Sca Fell"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7456/14112337924_7b04c0e430_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Breakfast on Sca Fell" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14278964730" title="Up to Sca Fell by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3884/14278964730_540e217c3a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Up to Sca Fell" /></a></p>

<p>I continue to smile, even as it gets more and more cloudy the nearer I get to the summit.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14100737371" title="Sca Fell in the mist by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7209/14100737371_aca59cc552_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Sca Fell in the mist" /></a></p>

<p>Once there, the summit is indeed dressed in clouds as, accompanied with a stiff breeze. Hardshell top and bottom come on, down I go.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14464228632" title="Foxes Tarn by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3851/14464228632_af387f9179_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Foxes Tarn" /></a></p>

<p>The descent to Foxes Tarn is nice though you should be sure-footed. The place itself looked clean and inviting for a camp, but I continued.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14464435354" title="Whaddyalookingat? by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2926/14464435354_ebe953770b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Whaddyalookingat?" /></a></p>

<p>Down a scrambly bit to the path up Scafell Pike. Good fun that section! Up on England’s highest hill I snap a Selfie and walk on. Views are good, people few.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14442477696" title="Scafell Pike by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5564/14442477696_133ca1fd87_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Scafell Pike" /></a></p>

<p>But it are the views from Bowfell that I enjoy most.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14278945979" title="Sca Fell &amp; Scafell Pike by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2921/14278945979_f9aeefc6de_b.jpg" width="680" height="1024" alt="Sca Fell &amp; Scafell Pike" /></a></p>

<p>I descend via the Flat Slabs and head onwards to the Old Dungeon Ghyll Climber’s Bar.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14465578885" title="Flat Slabs by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3885/14465578885_812eb60118_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Flat Slabs" /></a></p>

<p>A fine Ale, soup and a roll are consumed, and with not much enthusiasm I leave the fine establishment behind. My route takes me up to Stickle Tarn, where I count four other tents around the lake!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14485734013" title="Stickle Tarn by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3884/14485734013_8bbd3a8927_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Stickle Tarn" /></a></p>

<p>It’s windy and I’m soon in my quilt after a hot meal. It is a fiercely windy night and past midnight a couple descends to the valley past me under my TrailStar. Rain sets in occasionally. I drift in and out of sleep, and with dawn I’m up. The Coleman gas canister is empty (after just 3 l of water boiled!) and so I can’t have my morning coffee. Up I go, forgoing the scramble I came for.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14378696112" title="Above Stickle Tarn by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5040/14378696112_6157530f5f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Above Stickle Tarn" /></a></p>

<p>Drizzle and wind accompany me on my way to High Raise and onwards to Calf Crag, Gibson Knott and Helm Crag, before I descend to the village of Grasmere.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14193578570" title="Cloudy by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2938/14193578570_7f313cd441_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Cloudy" /></a></p>

<p>I buy a new gas canister and fruits, have a coffee and soup and head up Grisedale Tarn. The weather improves and the sun breaks through.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14465582995" title="Arriba by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5474/14465582995_f52759df3a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Arriba" /></a></p>

<p>My plan to go on to Helvellyn and walk its Ridges is dropped in favour of a low camp. But the valleys are private land and I don’t feel like sneaking into one of the woods to pitch my TrailStar and so end up in the Youth Hostel in Patterdale. A hot shower is enjoyed, and a good sleep is had.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14193489749" title="Looking up to Grisedale by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2939/14193489749_047e97d4e0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Looking up to Grisedale" /></a></p>

<p>Breakfast on the sofa, packing with plenty of space, wall to wall sunshine awaiting me. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/13948223152" title="That way by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2938/13948223152_b31fb818c2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="That way" /></a></p>

<p>Up to Angletarn Pikes. A lovely hill with fine views all the way.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/13948221232" title="Upwards by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7121/13948221232_2b2bbe2598_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Upwards" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14380144815" title="Lovely view by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2915/14380144815_d36e8bc42c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Lovely view" /></a></p>

<p>Angle Tarn is a wonderful place and would make a fine camping spot. Birds are swimming on its clear blue water, while the sun reflects in ripples as a slight breeze sweeps across it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14193530658" title="Angle Tarn by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3856/14193530658_46c3c33068_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Angle Tarn" /></a></p>

<p>The views from up here are magnificent, further enhenced by the superb weather. I walk with an open wind jacket and cuffs up, but soon decide it’s time to hike in my T-Shirt.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14193699467" title="Gate by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3837/14193699467_022eb5b942_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Gate" /></a></p>

<p>I take the faint path up Rest Dodd before heading down and up to The Knott. Time for coffee and Vitamin C in the sun, there’s no hurry anywhere.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14379174464" title="Coffee on The Knott by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2902/14379174464_06571c2c53_b.jpg" width="680" height="1024" alt="Coffee on The Knott" /></a></p>

<p>I stroll onwards to the High Street where plenty of day hikers enjoy the great weather. I shortly ponder a stroll up and down the Riggindale Crag, but decide to head onwards to the Thornthwaite Crag. A large cairn marker (more a tower, really) spends shade that is welcomed in this hot weather.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14193497129" title="Blue by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5231/14193497129_9eeb9496af_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Blue" /></a></p>

<p>The impending ridge walk of Froswick, Ill Bell and Yoke has me smiling ear to ear.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14379175414" title="Spikey by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5191/14379175414_3f63597556_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Spikey" /></a></p>

<p>Then water runs low and so I am looking out for water. Close to the Garburn Pass I find a gurgling stream and the Playtypuses are filled up and emptied right away. Tasty. So why not stay?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14380141145" title="Camp III by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2928/14380141145_b69ab58d1c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Camp III" /></a></p>

<p>I do. It’s beautiful and I love the views - Windermere to the south, the high hills to the west, crags, grass and sheep to the north and east. I have a mighty fine evening up on the hill, and fall asleep under the stars.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/13912268942" title="MLD TrailStar in the English Lake District. by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2900/13912268942_8066e0cef6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="MLD TrailStar in the English Lake District." /></a></p>

<p>The next morning the weather is again on repeat: Blue sky and sunshine. I take it slow, enjoy the last bit outside, but am soon enough on the trail. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14380137475" title="Troutbeck Tongue by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3918/14380137475_5f5a6dc457_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Troutbeck Tongue" /></a></p>

<p>Then I arrive at Orrest Head, Tourists being delighted by the view to be had from here. And also I smile, even as know that this will be the last time I will lay my eyes on the hills of the Lake District, those fine small mountains whom I just traversed. And so I walk down to the railway station, happy to return in the future.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Lake District is one of England’s most scenic National Parks, with steep hills, lush green valleys, glittering lakes and inviting Pubs. I traversed this beautiful area from Ravenglass to Windermere in a 125 km route and hiked up some of the most well-known mountains and camped at some beautiful sites.</p>

<p><em>It’s funny to think that on the birthday of the website I started my Lake District hike. Funny, as English blogs were one of the inspirations to start this site, and on it’s fifth birthday I was setting off to backpack in one of the most popular National Parks in the UK.</em></p>

<p>The Lake District has long appealed to me, and with the help of <a href="http://www.visitengland.com/">Visit England</a> I was able to realize this trip. As I had six days for backpacking I early on decided that a traverse would be best to see as much as possible, and my list of things I’d like to see was long, as I explained in my “<a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/04/planning-a-trip-in-the-lake-district.html">Planning a Trip in the Lake District</a>” article. </p>

<p>So on Monday morning I left Manchester by train and arrived punctual at 10:55 o’clock in Ravenglass, where I meet <a href="http://stevenhorner.com/">Steven</a> and Traci who would join me for the first day. We had a quick lunch at the Café in the Railway Station and then set off towards the hills. Steven explained to me the system of paths in the UK - I still am baffled by it! - and soon we were hiking past cows to the Muncaster Castle. We passed it, eager to get to the hills, but before that a short stroll on the street was necessary. As someone from the continent the left side traffic was something to be well aware of, as you do everything just the other way around as you’d at home. The walk on the street was quickly done, and then it was off into the wild - or the swamp. For quite a bit we were searching for the path, which was marked on our maps, to Devoke Water, but in the end we just gave up, took an aim and just kept on walking. Surely enough, close to the lake we then happened upon a trail which we followed for a bit before a short break. I refilled my water bottles and we enjoyed the fine views over the lake. As we had still some bit to go we continued, following the path to Woodend and then up to Great Worm Crag. The mandatory first summit photo was taken, I made a few quick bolder moves and onwards to White How and Green Crag we continued.</p>

<p>While there was a path marked down on my map, the reality looked different. Through a swamp, which has claimed the life of a sheep or two, we made it with even wetter feet to the foot of Harter Fell. The sun was shining, the full water bottles added a couple of kilograms of weight and so we started our ascent. Grazing sheep were gazing as we passed them by in what must have seemed like snail speed to them, but then, finally, we made it to a large “plateau” which lays a dozen of meters under the summit. We walked the last bit up to the Summit Marker and enjoyed the wide views: To the West lay the sea and the Isle of Man, a bit further to the north the southern tip of Scotland came into view, and to the north Sca Fell and Scafell Pike dominated the view and demanded attention. Further to the east Brown Pike, Dow Crag and the Old Man of Coniston could be seen. It was a magnificent place to be.</p>

<p>With plenty of space to pitch the TrailStars Traci and Steven pitched theirs on the plateau, while I went a bit further up between two large boulders. As the wind picked up we ate dinner together, enjoyed the sunset and rising moon, and had a Finnish dessert before hitting the hay. During the night the wind turned and was blowing well into my shelter. Not being amused I just took out a peg which practically closed the TrailStar, and a more calm nicht could be enjoyed. I was up with the sunrise (the sun still rising <em>“late”</em> back then) though the high wind demanded that I wear all my layers. We packed up and said our good byes, Steven &amp; Traci heading back to Eskdale while I set off to the west. </p>

<p>Through the re-forested Hardknott Forest I made my way down as the sun was rising and promised a fine day. Down at the river I happened upon a Parking place with benches, which made for the perfect breakfast spot. I enjoyed the bird song and purl of the river, only once or twice interrupted by a passing car. Refilled with water I walked down the street, passing by the gorgeous houses in the valley. A mother who was carrying her daughter walked a horse to the meadow and greeted me with a smile, and it is easy to imagine how good life must be far off the beaten track between the hills. I hiked on, finding the sign and path which brought me on line with my first summit of the day. </p>

<p>After some backtracking and climbing fences I made it on the road to Walna Scar Road. This path is so wide that you three to four people could hike next to each other - but right now I was alone, just far off in the distance I could make out a few couples slowly making their way to the top. Along the Long House Gill stream the path climbed continuously up, and at the crossroad I sat down to have a zip of water and some nuts. A father and son couple was now following behind me. I packed up and continued, the summit of Brown Pike getting closer and closer. </p>

<p>As I reached the crossroad underneath the summit, the wind welcomed me. I said a <em>“Hiya”</em> greeting to the couple who arrived with me at the crossroad from the other side, and while the husband was looking into his Wainwright the wife set off towards Brown Pike. I had a quick look across the valley and could see dozens of people on the Old Man and this side, so I continued. As I hiked from Buck Pike to Dow Crag two dayhikers and their dog emerged from the south rake, a scramble I had intended to do but as it would have meant walking down and then scrambling up again, I decided to leave it for the time being. However, seeing those two emerge, elated, I was a bit disappointed that I did not have the time to do this fine scramble. </p>

<p>Dow Crag was busy with families eating a summit lunch (in T-shirts and shorts in the blazing wind, nonetheless), and so I continued. The Old Man of Consiton was still so busy, with plenty of people arriving and leaving. I took in the view from the summit cairn, and then decided it’s time to go on. After Swirl How it got eerily devoid of people, and I strolled on my own onwards to the Grey Friar. A fine summit with views on Crinkle Crags, Bow Fell, Sca Fell and Scafell Pike I sat down for some water, figs and dates, trying to make out the path to the valley. As I took off I followed a faint path, but soon I was walking on sheep trails down. I arrived in a muddy field amongst cows, between me and the street an insurmountable lake of wet cow dung. The cows looked on as I tried to avoid to step in their excrements, hoping from stone to a small green island of grass, but to no avail: As I reached the gate my shoes were covered in wet cow poop. At the road in Cockley Beck I sat down at the stream, tried to rinse and dry my socks, but the smell &amp; colour of cow poop was intending to stay. Barefoot, eating nuts, I observed an old couple who happily arrived back at their car. After they packed up they came over to offer me a ride up the pass - they must have seen that I intended to go that way - but I kindly said “No, thank you” and explained that I’d mess up their car with my wet &amp; dirty shoes. <em>“That’s no problem”</em> came the reply - an answer I least expected! I smiled and explained I prefer to walk, and thanked them again.</p>

<p>After allowing my socks and shoes to dry a bit I slipped them back on and started the hike up Hardknott Pass road. Cars passing me smiled, and with some satisfaction I reached the top of the pass, from where I had a fine view on the Eskdale valley. I absolutely adore these views: Lush green fields speckled with white and black sheep, green forests, a blue river which meanders through the valley and lovely houses. I passed by the Roman Fort and walked on the road till I saw the sign up to Sca Fell. A family just arrived from the top, and with the clock being almost 17 they looked curiously as I hiked on. Now my plan was ambitious and I hoped to camp up on Sca Fell or at the Fox Tarn, though after almost 28 km hiked I decided to camp lower, in the vicinity of water, at a lovely camp spot. </p>

<p>I pitched the TrailStar, boiled water for food, tea &amp; dessert, and looked as a big, yellow moon was slowly rising at Hardknott Pass while the last cars of the day made their way up the street. </p>

<h2 id="packrafting-in-ruunaa">Packrafting in Ruunaa</h2>

<p>I was just back from the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/outdoor-fair-2013/">OutDoor Fair</a> when I saddled two packs with packrafts on my shoulders to travel to Ruunaa, where I was teaching a packrafting course. It was a very wet weekend, though we laughed, paddled and hiked a lot. One more packrafting aficionado joined the tribe, eagerly waiting to acquire his own, taking it on future adventures on rivers and lakes.</p>

<h2 id="backpacking-in-seitseminen">Backpacking in Seitseminen</h2>

<p>Another course with three superb clients, we were backpacking for three days in the beautiful Seitseminen National Park and learned about ultralight skills and gear. Gathered mushrooms, swam in the lake, sat around the fire and slept warm in hammocks and quilts, while the sun shone down on our trail. </p>

<h2 id="kungsleden">Kungsleden</h2>

<p>A failed trip is also a trip. After the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/03/abisko-ice-climbing-festival-2013-experiences.html">Abisko Ice Climbing Festival</a> I had an ambitious plan to ski a loop on the Kundgsleden, though as I took a fall while ice climbing where I injured my knee the skiing was just too painful, and so I returned after having skied 20 km on brand-new skis which I would have loved to take up some fjells. Alas, it was not meant to be, though I will return soon enough for a re-match.</p>

<p>The largest amount of untold stories are the dozens of <a href="http://www.outdoors.fi/destinations/WorldHeritageSites/kvarkenarchipelago/activities/Pages/Default.aspx">dayhikes</a> and overnighters here in the region. Plenty of great outdoor destinations around Vaasa, not only the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/05/a-family-hike-on-the-bodvattnet-runt.html">Kvarken Archipelago</a> which it counts to explore - by bike, packraft, on foot, and soon again on skis and snowshoes.</p>
