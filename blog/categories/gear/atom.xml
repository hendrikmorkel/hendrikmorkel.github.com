    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the spring and summer of this year <a href="http://blog.fastpacking.de/">Carsten</a> started the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/one-stop-shop/">One Stop Shop Series</a> and I added several international webshops to the list. Now I want to take an excursion into shopping NOT at one shop, but buying an Ultralight Gear List from several shops. Will it be lighter and cheaper than the average?</p>

<p>Carsten’s One Stop Shop Idea really was superb. It gave new and old backpackers an easy list of online shops with gear choices which allowed them to find the lightest and/ or cheapest gear to lighten up or get a complete backpacking kit. I tried to get a few big Retailers like <a href="http://bit.ly/UB20wn">REI.com</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/Wi4tZS">Backcountry.com</a> to join the series for even more options but wasn’t successful (well, maybe they join now ;). Anyway, with 13 shops from Europe, the USA and Japan budding lightweight backpackers have over a dozen of options to choose from and get inspiration for a lightweight kit. Here’s that list with weights &amp; prices for your convenience:</p>

<p><br />The thing is with the One Stop Shop: What if you really want a <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2010/05/packing-your-frameless-backpack-laufbursche-huckepack.html">Laufbursche huckePACK</a> as your backpack? Or a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpv4kAtN_DQ">Mountain Laurel Designs TrailStar</a> as your shelter? An <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/05/the-2nd-renaissance-of-esbit.html">Esbit Stove setup</a>? You always could adapt your shopping at the one shop you want to buy - they do, after all, often offer a lot more options than the ones they suggested. But what if another webshop has a better price on the kit you want? What if the shop <em>doesn’t have</em> the item you really want?</p>

<p>Then you’ll need to buy from several shops. While this will add extra costs in form of shipping costs (and import taxes if you order from outside Europe) it still might be cheaper - the € is still relatively strong which makes buying abroad more affordable. Thus my experiment is simple: I want to buy a few items I really want but try to keep the list as cheap &amp; light as possible. Here we go:</p>

<p><br />In this list I ordered from five different parties and this are the shipping costs to Finland: HMG 50 $, Laufbursche 17 €, PHD 24,90 £, Trekking-Lite-Store.com 13,50 €, Bergzeit 9,95 €. In the above total these are not included (currencies have been converted today via <a href="http://www.xe.com/">xe.com</a>) but would add 110,45€ to the total. I also only ordered the HMG UltaMid from outside Europe so only would need to pay import duties for it (or not with some luck!). I looked for bargains in the different shops, and thus with a total of 2.310,45 € I would get the exact kit I want from several different shops. My list still is cheaper than over half of the above shops, and only two shops offered a lighter list. </p>

<p><em>The conclusion?</em> If you’re starting out with backpacking and want to do it right (thus, light) from the start, buying all your gear from one shop is very convenient. However, if you want a special piece of gear that the shop doesn’t carry, it only minimally increases the costs to order it from somewhere else (and this is especially true in the USA, where lots of online retailers offer free shipping above a certain amount). Also, mixing it up and supporting small cottages like Laufbursche Gear, highly specialized companies like PHD, niche retailers like Treking-Lite-Store.com and large online shops like Bergzeit makes sense, as this way you can look for the best offers across them &amp; still save, and what the one doesn’t have the other can offer. </p>

    <link href="http://hendrikmorkel.github.com/2014/08/klymit-x-pillow.html"/>
    <updated>2014-08-15T23:15:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://hendrikmorkel.github.com/2014/08/klymit-x-pillow</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Not only a <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/sleeping-pads/">sleeping pad</a> is needed for a good night’s sleep on the trail, also a pillow is what many of us want for sweet dreams under the stars. After trying several pillows and fussing around with spare clothes I found the Klymit Pillow X and don’t go backpacking without it anymore.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14732148989" title="75% of the sleep system deployed by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5554/14732148989_77b4b1a3af_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="75% of the sleep system deployed" /></a></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Another 56 g that’s added to the sleep system. If it looks like there’s a gear-increase, that well may be possible. But after years of fussing around with rolled-up clothing or stuff sacks to act as a pillow, trying some other <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/kissen/">backpacking pillows</a> and trying to learn to sleep without one I pulled the trigger on the <a href="http://bit.ly/1BiBQ6m">Klymit Pillow X</a> as I saw it over at <a href="http://www.mountainlaureldesigns.com/shop/product_info.php?cPath=42&amp;products_id=207">Mountain Laurel Designs</a>. I didn’t bother reading reviews (there were none) but felt this would be a winning purchase just by a look at the design.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14923923062" title="Klymit Pillow X Packed Size by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3854/14923923062_c4b0718a72_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Klymit Pillow X Packed Size" /></a></p>

<p>That X is where the magic happens, design-wise. It centres your head in the middle, cradles it a bit, and works great for side and back sleepers. I turn a lot in my sleep, from side to belly to side to back and onwards, and the Pillow X is comfortable in any of these positions. I even can prop my arm up underneath it, almost as home. I have used it on all long hikes this year, from winter camping in the north to hillwalking in the Lake District and backpacking on the Eisleck Trail and the result is: It’s a winner. It gets packed always, because I value good sleep on the trail. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14918461392" title="Therm-A-Rest NeoAir XLite &amp; Klymit X Pillow by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5579/14918461392_fca784d892_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Therm-A-Rest NeoAir XLite &amp; Klymit X Pillow" /></a></p>

<p>Two puffs to inflate. It takes longer to deflate and roll up the Pillow X, around a minute or two, as the X construction likes to trap air here and there. But hey, that’s OK, there’s usually no hurry in the mornings. When the vlave looks big: It is. But it ain’t in the way for me, in a pinch you can even turn the pillow around and don’t have the valve on top. Maybe Klymit will at some point use a smaller vlave which would save some weight and not stand out that much, but even like this it works well.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14918807565" title="Therm-A-Rest NeoAir XLite &amp; Klymit X Pillow by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5574/14918807565_ee3f52704a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Therm-A-Rest NeoAir XLite &amp; Klymit X Pillow" /></a></p>

<p>The bottomline is pretty straight forward: When I pack along with the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/therm-a-rest-neoair-xlite.html">XLite</a> or <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/04/therm-a-rest-neoair-xtherm.html">Xtherm</a> the Pillow X always comes along. It are 56 g that I’m happy to carry for a comfy pillow that works. If you feel the same and want to get a good night’s sleep order your Pillow X from <a href="http://www.mountainlaureldesigns.com/shop/product_info.php?cPath=42&amp;products_id=207">Mountain Laurel Designs</a> or directly from <a href="http://bit.ly/1BiBQ6m">Klymit</a>.</p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>I’m sleeping on the NeoAir XLite Regular since August 2013 when it’s the season. It was along in the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/09/urho-kekkonen-national-park.html">Urho-Kekkonen National Park</a>, on the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/01/koli-national-park.html">2013 UL Summit</a> and every hike of 2014. I slept over 50 nights on this mat and it still works superb.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14915727601" title="Therm-A-Rest NeoAir XLite by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3883/14915727601_8491b07928_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Therm-A-Rest NeoAir XLite" /></a></p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>Like the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/04/therm-a-rest-neoair-xtherm.html">NeoAir XTherm</a> the XLite’s function is to provide you with a warm and comfortable bed at camp while being small &amp; light when being carried in your pack. The mattress is insulating you towards the ground so you can sleep warm.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14732150280" title="Therm-A-Rest NeoAir XLite, inflated by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5552/14732150280_caed27a91e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Therm-A-Rest NeoAir XLite, inflated" /></a></p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>My Regular length XLite has the following specs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>R-Value 3,2</li>
  <li>183 cm long, 6 cm thick, tapers from 49 cm to 38 cm (that’s the real inflated width)</li>
  <li>Reflective ThermaCapture™ technology traps radiant heat </li>
  <li>Triangular Core Matrix™ construction minimizes convective heat loss</li>
  <li>Made in Ireland</li>
</ul>

<p>The XLite is available in three sizes (S = 119 cm long, 230 g/ Regular = 183 cm long, 353 g/ L = 196 cm, 460 g) and a Women’s Version (168 cm, 340 g) which has a higher R-Value.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14732146959" title="Sleep &amp; shelter system by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3882/14732146959_1ed65c71de_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Sleep &amp; shelter system" /></a></p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>The Reflective ThermaCapture™ technology is an innovation. It are reflective layers inside the NeoAir mattress that reflect radiant heat back to your body, and so amplifys the warmth without the bulk, weight or durability issues of down and synthetic fills. Also the Triangular Core Matrix™ construction is an innovation, this construction combines two layers of triangular baffles to create over a hundred insulating cells in the mattress and so slowing down convective heat loss as well as delivering very good stability for maximum comfort.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14918803885" title="75% of the sleep system deployed by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5563/14918803885_16ef248408_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="75% of the sleep system deployed" /></a></p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>After over 50 nights on thee mattress it still works and looks great and shows no signs of weaknesses. It’s a durable mat and can take the abuse of what you encounter when you’re backpacking.</p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>The Regular length XLite is 353 g.</p>

<h2 id="sustainability--recyclability">Sustainability &amp; Recyclability</h2>

<p>The XLite is made in Ireland of oil based materials and has a coating on the inside, so shouldn’t be thrown in the garbage like ordinary rubbish. You could try to either recycle it via your local outdoor shop or inquire from Therm-A-Rest how to recycle the mat at the end of its life cycle.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14918814195" title="Valve by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3906/14918814195_4dd814de57_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Valve" /></a></p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p>15 large breaths, that’s how often a non-smoker will need to inhale and exhale to make out of the small, rolled up package a fully inflated, comfy mat. If you like it softer, maybe 13 or 14 are enough, and if you have a small lunge volume it might be more, but 15 breaths is what it takes me to inflate this mat. If that seems too much for you then Therm-A-Rest has a a <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/therm-a-rest-neoair-mini-pump/">Mini Pump</a> for you which will add 65 g to your pack or an <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/therm-a-rest-neo-air-pumpsack/">Pump Sack</a> that adds 77 g to your packed weight and make life on the trail slightly easier. Of course then you just also could take a self-inflating mat or a closed cell foam mat and be done and never inflate a mattress again. </p>

<p>But those mats are quite a bit larger in packed size and often also quite a bit more heavy. So with a mat like the XLite you get a light mat that packs up small - about 1 l rolled up is what it will take of the space in you pack. Speaking of the rolled up mat, deflating is just as easy as inflating. Open the valve and it will largely empty itself, but to speed things up you can kneel on it. When it’s fully deflated I lay it out flat, fold it twice into the middle and then roll it up, that way I get an approximately 23 cm long package that’s about 9 cm in diameter.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14732244997" title="Therm-A-Rest NeoAir XLite, folded by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3904/14732244997_e1fbff813e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Therm-A-Rest NeoAir XLite, folded" /></a></p>

<p>One of the reasons you will consider the XLite is Comfort. At six cm thick the XLite is fully inflated a very comfy mattress, and if you like more cushy/ soft mattresses just open the valve to adjust it to your liking. It also makes camping fairly flexible as you’re less dependent on 100% even surfaces - if theres a root protruding from the spot you want to camp the XLite is able to comfortably lay on top of it and you’d have never known. Similarly it’s great for camping on the rocks, for example if you want to bivy on a summit. While it’s a durable mat I do carry a <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/exped-doublemat-evazote-sleeping-mat.html">very thin Exped CCF pad</a> along which I lay underneath the XLite to protect it a bit from sharp, small rocks or stuff I might have not seen. It’s also a good back-up and adds a bit of extra warmth.</p>

<p>Warmth is one of the other things where the XLite shines. It’s a warm mattress - I had it down to around -5°C and was toasty on it and never knew I’m on a 3-Season pad. Which means you’re good to go till late autumn with this mattress, and if you like to use a CCF pad in winter as a back-up either way you even might be able to use the XLite in mild winters. For serious cold winters I’d still use the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/04/therm-a-rest-neoair-xtherm.html">XTherm</a>, though.</p>

<p>Finally, the XLite fits well into my different bivys. While in SUL bivys which are not very high you might run into trouble, my tyvek, Pertx and Cuben bivys are all wide and spacious enough to accommodate this inflated mattress. If you use a thin mattress right now and your bivy is a bit tight already it might be useful to get a more spacious bivy at the same time that you’re getting the XLite. If you don’t use a bivy this obviously will be of no concern =)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/13982574636" title="Good night! by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7203/13982574636_c7f96370bb_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Good night!" /></a></p>

<h2 id="competing-products">Competing Products</h2>

<p>There’s a few mattresses that fill the same niche as the XLite: There’s the <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/exped-synmat-7-isolierte-isomatte-kunstfaserfuellung/">Exped SynMat 7</a>, the <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/mammut-light-pump-mat-ul-isomatte/">Mammut Light Pump Mat UL</a>, <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/vaude-norrsken-primaloft-isomatte/">Vaude Norrsken</a> and the <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/trangoworld-micro-air-isomatte/">Trangoworld Micro Air</a> which all have a similar pack size and warmth rating but most of these are heavier. </p>

<h2 id="what-could-be-better">What Could Be Better</h2>

<p>I have no complains about the XLite. Sure, at some point in time it’d be nice to get the same warmth &amp; comfort for less weight, but for now I’m happy. Those that always thought the XLite and XTherm were to loud, Therm-A-Rest has heard you and <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/07/outdoor-news-2014-day-2.html">from 2015 on the mats will be more silent</a>. And those that would like to not have to inflate their XLite but still want a 5 cm thick pad should get the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/07/outdoor-news-2014-day-2.html">EvoLite</a> in 2015.</p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>After many years of backpacking and sleeping outside it’s pretty straight forward for me when I pack the sleep system: Spring till autumn it’s the XLite, winter and high-altitude it’s the XTherm. The XLite packs small in my pack when on the trail and is lightweight with just 353 g for the 183 cm long mattress. After 15 puffs of air at camp I have a comfy mat to chill and sleep on that keeps me well insulated against the ground. It makes finding a 100% perfect camp spots less of a hassle as I can lay comfortable above roots and round rocks on this 6 cm thick pad. Most important, I get a great nights sleep on it every time and am ready for another good day on the trail, where the small packed mattress again disappears in my pack. If you want comfort &amp; warmth paired with a light weight and small pack size, look no further than the Therm-A-Rest NeoAir XLite.</p>

<h2 id="supernatural">super.natural</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.supern8ural.com/en/about.htm">super.natural</a> hails from München and they like to combine Merino wool with durable polyamide fibres. The result are yarns that offer the best of both materials and these are then sewn into some very nice garments. They have a Women’s Yoga range which looked super comfy while being very stylish - garments that could be used for climbing &amp; hiking in the blink of an eye. But really any of their garments from the Base, Training and Superfly ranges could do well outdoors while still looking good when returning to the city. I tried some garments on and really liked them - good fit, freedom of movement, soft on the skin and they let light.</p>

<h2 id="aarn-packs">Aarn Packs</h2>

<p>All <a href="http://www.aarnpacks.com/">Aarn Packs</a> get a more streamlined, clean look. They’ve been optimized in several ways, and should now be even more suitable to runners, backpackers and hikers alike. </p>

<h2 id="mountain-network">Mountain Network</h2>

<p>Now something for the climbing gym owners and climbing clubs: <a href="http://www.mountain-network.eu/">Mountain Network</a> has created a climbing wall system that is self-bearing and that can be used indoors &amp; outdoors. Prefabricated elements allow you to build a tower like the one underneath in a day which makes them not just ideal for events, but also for hotels and other places which want to have a climbing wall e.g. over the summer outside and then store it away when the winter comes. It’s not just ideal to build climbing walls but also for bouldering walls. <a href="http://www.mountain-network.eu/klimwanden/klimwanden/driehoek-klimwanden/algemene-informatie/">Check out the video and photos on their site</a>, it’s pretty cool - so cool that it won an OutDoor Award!</p>

<h2 id="mountain-hardwear">Mountain Hardwear</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.mountainhardwear.com/">Mountain Hardwear</a> Stretch Ozonic jacket is a 276 g 2.5-layer shell with good stretch. It’s made from the Dry.Q® Active fabric which has a ‘soft shell’ feel with the benefits and light weight of a hard-shell. It felt nice and Mountain Hardwear claims this is a great wet weather hiking jacket, so it could be interesting for those that prefer to walk in the rain and not this hot weather!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14589426959" title="Mountain Hardwear Stretch Ozonic™ jacket by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3843/14589426959_cc9d15efc3_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Mountain Hardwear Stretch Ozonic™ jacket" /></a></p>

<p>The Quasar™ Lite Jacket is 340 g light and uses another Mountain Hardwear fabric, Dry.Q™ Elite. It’s also a 2.5 layer shell but has two harness/ hipbelt compatible pockets with a mesh lining that help with venting. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14589448528" title="Mountain Hardwear Quasar™ Lite Jacket by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3856/14589448528_8cd312f7d4_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Mountain Hardwear Quasar™ Lite Jacket" /></a></p>

<p>Mountain Hardwear uses OutDry in some of their packs, and the newest addition is the Scrambler 30. OutDry makes this pack’s main compartment completely waterproof. It has a 30 l volume and weighs 770 g and can carry between four and 11 kg. The waistbelt is stowable and you can carry your skis, ice tools or trekking poles. A versatile pack that should keep your gear dry in any situation.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14589380770" title="Mountain Hardwear Scrambler™ 30 OutDry® by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5559/14589380770_c46164af2c_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Mountain Hardwear Scrambler™ 30 OutDry®" /></a></p>

<p>The Mountain Hardwear Optic tent series gives you grand vistas through the possibility to open two adjacent doors for 180° views. The Optic 6 gives this possibility now to your next family camping trip. Not a lightweight shelter by any means at almost 7 kg, it does offer plenty of space - six adults could sleep in there, but please don’t move much in your sleep then. I think it’d be good for a family with two to three kids. At 500€ it’s certainly cheaper than many other camping tents where you can stand in, and divided between a family it is even lightweight when hiking. </p>

<h2 id="tenaya">Tenaya</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.tenaya.net/index.php">Tenaya</a> makes climbing shoes. I decided to swing by and see what this company from Spain has to offer to us climbers and tried their <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/tenaya-oasi-kletterschuhe/?pid=81">Oasi</a> on. Wow. It’s hands down the most comfy climbing shoe I have worn - and that while also allowing for precision on small holds and hooking. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AlexanderMegosSportler">Alex Megos</a> wears them, and he certainly knows a thing to two about climbing and shoes. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14776098195" title="Tenayah Oasi by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3839/14776098195_1ec22697e0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Tenayah Oasi" /></a></p>

<p>But the Oasi isn’t new. The Tarifa is. It is a laced shoe and is designed for versatile performance and comfort on rock. It has a Vibram XS Grip 3.5 mm sole and is similarly constructed like the Oasi - I’d say it’s the Oasi with laces instead of the Velcro closure system. Definitely a shoe to try on if you have a chance, as its comfy with great performance. </p>

<h2 id="rock-technologies">Rock Technologies</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.rocktechnologies.co.uk/">Rock Technologies</a> is the UK’s largest manufacturer of loose chalk and chalk balls, as well as several other climbing-related gear. They’re in business since 2001 and Richard, the owner started in his mother’s garage until the business was getting to big and dusty! Now they produce their high-quality chalk products in the UK and Austria, and they use only medical grade magnesium carbonate which minimizes health risks. Other products are a power putty for training and finger tape - I got some of the gear here on test and will report back after use.</p>

<h2 id="goal-zero">Goal Zero</h2>

<p>Power on the go - with <a href="http://bit.ly/1rXAMAH">Goal Zero</a> no problem. The Rock Out2 Solar Speaker is well suited for those backpacking parties where you don’t have a guitar along but need some tunes. The speaker hooks up via Bluetooth or a audio jack to your phone and gives an adequate sound for your next beach or outdoor party - 20 hours long or as long as the sun shines.</p>

<p>The Torch 250 is a torch that can be powered via the solar panel or the crank. It has a between 70 and 180 Lumen depending on the mode you choose, and also has a red light. I wouldn’t carry it on a backpacking trip, but if you need a torch in your house or car for emergencies and don’t want to also have many batteries to power it, this would be the best alternative.</p>

<p>A piece of gear that certainly is something for backpackers is the Switch 10 Set. It consists of the Nomad 7 Solar Panel, Goal Zero Switch 10 Recharger and three add-on for the latter: A Ventilator (made from silicone so folds up), a USB to Mini-USB converter and a torch. These connect to the Switch 10 (which packs some more power than the current Switch 8). Weight will be probably a bit over 500 g all included, but if you only take what you need that goes down. The panel itself can store all the gear in a mesh pocket on the back and be strapped to your pack so you can power up while you hike.</p>

<h2 id="pramo">Páramo</h2>

<p><a href="http://paramo.co.uk/en-gb/index.php">Páramo</a> introduced three fleece/ windproof duos that use their innovative combination of Nikwax® Fleece with Nikwax® Windproof fabrics to create a versatile system. On their own both the fleeces and windproofs are water-repellent and able to hold off a rain shower. However, when worn together they provide the equivalent protection to a Páramo Analogy® Waterproof. And all of that PFC-free! Interesting for mountaineers and climbers is the Men’s Enduro &amp; Ladies’ Ventura Fleece/ Windproof Systems, these have an athletic fit, are harness, helmet and glove compatible and both have (aligned) hoods. The Men’s Bora &amp; Ladies’ Zonda duos are for hill walkers and backpackers, while the Men’s Bentu is for the everyday walker. Nice garments, made by a company that takes environmental and social matters serious and makes good efforts to make the (outdoor) world a better place.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14589599957" title="Páramo by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3870/14589599957_442af65f57_b.jpg" width="862" height="1024" alt="Páramo" /></a></p>

<p>The company also launched an Active Travel Collection, made of cool, protective and lightweight garments. They’re made of the Nikwax fabrics Parameta A and Cotton+ which keep you cool and provide protection against UV rays and biting insects. I imagine this would work well for backpacking in hot regions or just as casual garments in the office and town. </p>

<h2 id="scandinavian-outdoor-group">Scandinavian Outdoor Group</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.scandinavianoutdoorgroup.com/">Scandinavian Outdoor Group</a> not just has the tastiest coffee on the fair at the SOG Bar, but also unites the best outdoor brands from the north. The SOG Press Conference was an interesting event to attend, where 13 companies presented themselves and their newest creations. The SOG also heads out before each fair and tests kit that has been submitted for consideration for the prestigious SOG Award, which this time went again to Röjk and their PrimaLoft Zippen Hood. There were lots of great presentations with heaps of humour, which shows that the North not just builds some high-quality gear but also can have a laugh about themselves =)</p>

<h2 id="big-agnes">Big Agnes</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.bigagnes.com/">Big Agnes</a> is still pretty hard to get in Europe so it was nice to check out their gear and meet the team. The Fly Creek UL 2 looked pretty cool and also won a OutDoor Award, and at packed weight of 1.050 g for the 2 Person version it’s a pretty impressive looking shelter. If you are hiking with a tablet or Kindle, install the Entertainment Center Loft inside and you can read or view a movie while lying down or sitting in the tent.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14476728320" title="Big Agnes Fly Creek UL 2 by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2900/14476728320_c3dc5d9a36_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Big Agnes Fly Creek UL 2" /></a>

<p>The Double Z Air Pad will be available as an Insulated version and should keep you warm when it gets cold. Pack size looked good, as did the thickness and size of the pad. It’s gonna be 595 g light in the 183 x 51 cm size and uses PrimaLoft Silver Hi-Loft as an insulation material to achieve an R-Value of 4.5.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14661141894" title="Big Agnes Insulated Double Z Air Pad by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3896/14661141894_49fc01c9fa_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Big Agnes Insulated Double Z Air Pad" /></a></p>

<p>Finally, mtnGlo™ is a really smart way to illuminate your shelter at night. Flexible LEDs are sewn into several of the Big Agnes models available, like the Copper Spur UL2 and UL3, Rattlesnake SL1 - SL4, Ripple Creek UL2+ and several more. But Big Agnes also thought about those tent users who don’t want to buy a new tent but would like to enjoy mtnGlo™ light inside, and that’s where the mtnGlo™ Tent Light Accessory Kit comes in handy. It’s a 254 cm long LED strand with Power pack that you can easily clip into the ceiling of your tent or shelter and <em>Voilá</em> - it’s light! Clips are included, the whole package is 84 g and is powered by three AAA batteries. </p>

<h2 id="salomon">Salomon</h2>

<p><a href="http://bit.ly/1qffpI5">Salomon</a> presented a sub 400 g, crampon compatible mountaineering boot, the Salomon S-Lab Alp Carbon GTX. It uses a carbon fibre midsole that is laterally stable but otherwise flexible. A Contragrip sole, a Sensifit upper with GTX lining &amp; Quicklace closure, this is the shoe for all those that like to run mountains up. I’m generally not a boot type, but this is a boot I’m excited about.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14589445398" title="Salomon S-Lab Alp Carbon GTX by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3843/14589445398_8ec27437af_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Salomon S-Lab Alp Carbon GTX" /></a>

<p>Flowtech is Salomon’s idea of venting on strenuous ascents where you don’t want to take the jacket off. Just open the zippers, roll the front up and keep it in place with the bungee cord. Good idea, but how will it work in the field?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14640394336" title="Salomon by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5570/14640394336_bc32c5c9d3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Salomon" /></a></p>

<p>The Ellipse Sport W is Salomon’s Women-only shoe. It has a women’s last and design and is from their hiking/ sports line, so could be a suitable hiking shoe for the ladies. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14663377945" title="Salomon Ellipse Sport W by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5544/14663377945_3c5b68268c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Salomon Ellipse Sport W" /></a></p>

<p>The S-Lab Sense 4 Ultra SG goes into round four. The rubber on the sole has been made a bit more durable, so you might now get two Ultras out of one pair ;) It’s still as grippy and light as the ones before it - a fine shoe, slightly better.</p>

<p>The Speedcross 3 continues to be one of Salomon’s most popular shoes and now get updated colours for 2015, including Camo, which means finally hunters and Bushcrafters can wear them. </p>

<h2 id="sealskinz">Sealskinz</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.sealskinz.com/UK/?skip_welcome_popup">Sealskinz</a> is also a company which I have read about a lot but have never tried their gear, so it was nice to put on some of their socks and gloves. The socks felt comfy warm and I can imagine them working well in wet weather or in winter when skiing, snow shoeing or ice climbing. The gloves had a good fit and the different models I tried on gave me quickly warm hands! There were a couple of models which I think could work well for winter mountaineering/ hiking and ice climbing, though for me they might be too warm to use in summer. </p>

<h2 id="jetboil">Jetboil</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.jetboil.com/">Jetboil</a> killed the Sol (Ti) cooking system. The company realized it’s too specialist and that the Ti pot and aluminium heat exchanger didn’t get along well, so the new stove for 2015 is the MiniMo. It’s a 415 g system with a wide, low pot that in my indoor test at the OutDoor boiled 1 l of water in 3:08 minutes. The pot is easier to attach to the stove unit and the stoves valve and regulator have been redesigned and were easier to use and you can put the flame really low - it actually might be possible to cook in it now. There’s still the Piezo ignition on it, and the pot also got a pair of silicone-covered metal handles. Those cozies are interchangeable, and there’s four different ones available from the time the MiniMo hits the shelves. </p>

<h2 id="ortovox">Ortovox</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.ortovox.de/">Ortovox</a> introduces a really cool looking Cargo Pants which is made from Cordura® Wool - a mix of 55% Merino wool and 45% Cordura with an ecorepel® finish which makes it dirt and water-repellant and is PFC-free. Stretch inserts and an athletic cut mean you’ll have freedom of movement in these, and for very hot summer days there will also be a Shorts available from the same material - also in some cool colours. Supergeil they look, especially in orange. Equally Supergeil is the Rock’N’Wool Double Check Shirt which I sport here. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14447506168" title="ORTOVOX Rock&#x27;N&#x27;Wool Double Check Shirt by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2929/14447506168_633cb20f00_b.jpg" width="880" height="1024" alt="ORTOVOX Rock&#x27;N&#x27;Wool Double Check Shirt" /></a></p>

<p>The 100% Merino wool shirt in a light 133 g/ m2 quality which makes it well suited for summer use. It combines all the good stuff you like about Merino wool with a kickass style - gone the times of boring black shirts. You probably want to wear a pair of Sports Rock’N’Wool Cool socks with the shirt &amp; pants or shorts. What looks like you dressed in a hurry in the morning actually is on purpose: The socks are of different colours. And they employ Tencel which cools your feet, which makes them ideal for the tropic temperatures we currently enjoy in Finland. </p>

<p>On those fresh summer 2015 evening you can put on the Swisswool Light Tec Vest. It’s swiss wool - wool which in the past was treated as waste as the fibres are too short. But Ortovox figured out how to use the wool - as an insulation material in their Swisswool garments. The Vest here will weigh 263 g and has a fine hood, zipper pockets that are sitting high on the vest and thus won’t interfere with your hipbelt or harness.</p>

<h2 id="mountain-equipment">Mountain Equipment</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.mountain-equipment.com/">Mountain Equipment</a> from the UK has a few nice pieces coming for the next year. I like off-set zippers so I did enjoy trying on the Squall Hooded Jacket. It’s a climbing softshell jacket, 310 g light and retails for 120€. It’s a climbing specific fit with good freedom of movement, articulated sleeves and a helmet compatible hood. The asymmetric zipper not just looks good, it’s also practical as so the zipper won’t rub against the front of your chin/ face. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14447709677" title="Mountain Equipment Squall Hooded Jacket by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5471/14447709677_8e3652e80c_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Mountain Equipment Squall Hooded Jacket" /></a></p>

<p>The Kinesis Jacket will be a 325 g Polartec Alpha garment and from the quick test at the booth convinced me with a good fit, being stowable in its own pocket and a nice waffle fleece lining on the sleeves and hood. It uses the ME Helium 30 fabric as a shell which makes it windproof. It was a good fit and should work well on its own or as a midlayer under a shell/ windjacket for some extra warmth.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14447499859" title="Mountain Equipment Kinesis Jacket by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5593/14447499859_0f1dd52ef9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Mountain Equipment Kinesis Jacket" /></a></p>

<p>The Foil Jacket is a 85 g wind jacket with an interesting hem drawstring. It’s going above the butt as you can see underneath, so that the fabric covering your buttocks - which is longer - has some movement. This might mean the jacket won’t ride up as jacket with drawstring at the hem often do - testing will show this in the future. It has thumbloops, articulated sleeves and packs into its own chest pocket.</p>

<p>The Aurora Synthetic sleeping bag uses Climashield Apex for insulation, the same material many cottages uses in their quilts. There’s three models available with Comfort ratings of 3°C, -1°C and -4°C and will start at 180€. They have a wind-resistant shell fabric, a 3/4 zipper and a collar, and if the weight is good (don’t know, sorry) these might be interesting for those that prefer synthetic sleeping bags.</p>

<h2 id="primaloft">PrimaLoft</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.primaloft.com/uk/performance/home.html">PrimaLoft</a> showed off their Performance Down Blend material, a material that combines European down (EDFA and ADFC monitored) with PrimaLoft microfibres. The down is given a PFC-free water-repellent coating and then is <em>bound homogenously with the ultra-fine PrimaLoft® fibers that root the water-repellent qualities permanently in the fibers so they cannot be washed out.</em> It’s supposed to retain its structure even when wet and more than 90% of the heat is still stored then, too. It’s bluesign certified and I got a down short with the material here so will put those claims to the test in a bit - right now it’s a bit too hot to wear them.</p>

<h2 id="rab">Rab</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://rab.uk.com/">Rab</a> Guidebook was hands down the best workbook/ catalogue I was given at the entire fair. Five Rab athletes tell stories in it, and Rab highlights six clothing systems in it. Gorgeous photos, superb layout and typography choices, these are the small highlights at the fair which delight me. </p>

<p>Oh, the gear from them wasn’t bad, either. The Polar Bedding Bag allows you to store your sleep system largely uncompressed on top of your pulka. I can see how you can use this even as a groundsheet in a snow cave or similar - just throw the Polar Bedding Bag in, open the zipper and lay down in bed. It’s a 800 g heavy item, so you really will want to have that pulka to transport it. </p>

<p>The MeCo shirts get updated colours including striped versions, but most importantly now all garments will also be available in a women’s fit. So get ready to give your better half a lovely MeCo hoody, Meco Boxers and MeCo pants.</p>

<p>The Vapour-rise family has gotten a couple of additions with the Women’s Vapour-rise Flex Jacket and for men there will be the Vapour-rise Flex Pull-On, Flex Vest and Flex Jacket. These use, as you might guess from the name, Vapour-rise in the front and back with stretch side panels. These are more minimalist and will tip the scales at 180 g for the vest and 250 g for the Pull-On.</p>

<p>The Ventus and Lunar (for the Ladies) Jackets pictured underneath are made from the Matrix SWS fabric with a Polygiene treatment. They’re windshells that are breathable, have an under the helmet hood, thumbloops and weigh 335 g for the Men and 255 g for the Women. </p>

<h2 id="haglfs">Haglöfs</h2>

<p>The Swedes from <a href="http://www.haglofs.com/en-US/">Haglöfs</a> have (re-)discovered L.I.M. and have created an outfit (pants, midlayer, shell jacket, shoes) and backpack with sleeping bag that’s a mighty fine 1.492 g. Throw in your shelter and cooking system of choice and you could end up with a SUL setup. Costs for the outfit and gear will set you back probably an amount similar to the weight, but lets ignore the money for a moment and concentrate on the fact that here’s a global outdoor company that has created a very light outfit, sleeping bag and backpack. While we have seen many UL attempts in the past from several companies it often were stand-alone pieces - a windjacket here, a light pants there. But here you get a complete outfit, in rocking materials and colours if I may say so. That’s pretty nifty.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14532836337" title="Haglöfs L.I.M. by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3838/14532836337_c54a6fc73c_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Haglöfs L.I.M." /></a></p>

<p>OK, lets look a bit at the different components. The L:I:M: Down sleeping bag uses a 7D shell fabric and 800 cuin, bluesign certified down. It’s 473 g and has no zipper, but the foot box is open so you could just slip it over your head. Or walk with your sleeping bag outside at night when you can’t hold it anymore (pull it up before you let it run, though). It has a +6°C Comfort rating so is something for those sumer hikes.</p>

<p>The L.I.M. Low shoe weighs 220 g in UK Size 8. It has a 5 mm heel drop, some rear cushioing, a water-repellant mesh upper (water-repellant mesh?) and the idea is, yes, fast hiking. The sole looked and felt grippy and it’s a super flexible shoe.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14739134983" title="Haglöfs L.I.M. Low by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3839/14739134983_d7163b9ce1_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Haglöfs L.I.M. Low" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14532619168" title="Haglöfs L.I.M. Low by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3887/14532619168_32f0b71853_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Haglöfs L.I.M. Low" /></a></p>

<p>The L.I.M. Wind Pull is a 65 g (Size L) wind shirt, made from a 7D fabric. It has a DWR coating so will be a bit water-repellant. It has a hood and a long zipper and even a zippered Napoleon pocket. The 175 g (Size L) L.I.M. II Trek Pant are made from a polyamide/ polyester double weave fabric that’s bluesign certified. UPF 30, quick-drying and comfy, soft feeling on the skin. Nice. Then there’s the Midlayer, the 155 g (Size L, you guessed it)  L.I.M. Power Dry Top. It uses Polartec PowerDry fabric, that awesome material that wicks sweat super-fast away and makes you feel dry and warm. Long zipper, zippered chest pocket. Besides the garments there’s several shell jackets and pants, down and synthetic insulation jackets, a softshell, shorts, T-Shirts and longsleeves and a hoody - all very light: The heaviest L.I.M. garment is the Active Jacket which weighs 350 g. </p>

<p>And then there’s still the L.I.M. backpack. 355 g, frameless, 25 l volume (it felt bigger), a good compression system, a zippered lid pocket and two elastic side pockets, this was a high-riding pack that felt pretty good. How it really carries with a UL load and a week’s food we’ll need to test.</p>

<h2 id="suunto">Suunto</h2>

<p><a href="http://bit.ly/1qInObH">Suunto</a> launched the Ambit3 Peak and Sport. For us outdoor-types the Peak is of interest, though both are Bluetooth compatible. The Movescount app will get an update shortly which will allow you to update Movescount on the go via your iPhone or iPad. The watch itself can also communicate with the new Bluetooth accessories and has the ABC and GPS tools you know from the Ambit already. </p>

<h2 id="la-sportiva">La Sportiva</h2>

<p><a href="http://lasportiva.com/">La Sportiva</a> has won a OutDoor Award with their Primer GTX shoe, which is a 390 g (per shoe) Gore-Tex Surround shoe. The <em>SURROUND technology guarantees unequalled breathability, thanks to the breathable surface that makes up the upper and the midsole</em>. That cool, H.R. Giger-esque look also has some function, and is called a Nano-Cells construction method. These should be breathable cells, give structure to the shoe and promote the elimination of humidity. It’s like you have an alien on your feet! The Primer GTX is a traditional lacing shoe while the Synthesis GTX is amid-cut boot with a quick-lace system (and is 395 g per shoe). Both have Ortholite insoles and Vibram soles that look grippy. </p>

<p>The Genius is the Italians latest climbing shoe and is made for sport, trad, free climbing and normal to wide volume feet. The pair is 440 g, it has a 3 mm Vibram XSGrip2 sole and a suede leather combined with microfiber upper. The No-Edge technology means the the shoe adapts better to the rock because of the larger surface of the shoe that comes in contact with the holds.  The asymmetric lacing system should make for a good fit and the P3 stands for Permanent Power Platform which should make the shoe more long-lasting as it helps with keeping the down-turned shape over time.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14716484481" title="La Sportiva Genius by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3890/14716484481_d4ffa00fe8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="La Sportiva Genius" /></a>

<p>The Mutant is a new Mountain Running shoe. 320 g per shoe, 10 mm drop, a FriXion XF ultra grippy sole and an integrated gaiter, it looked like a very fine shoe for running or lightweight hiking. The lacing system is called FusionGate and allows for volume regulation in the heel and foot adherence. </p>

<p>Finally, the Helios SR is a 240 g, 2 mm drop shoe. Mesh uppers for breathability, a 4 mm Ortholite Mountain Running Ergonomic insole, again a FriXion XT ultra grippy sole for grip on any terrain and a slip-on construction, it’s an interesting, lightweight shoe.</p>

<h2 id="montane">Montane</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.montane.co.uk/">Montane</a> has established itself since a while as a serious company when it comes to lightweight, durable and functional garments. Their 2015 line continues with these premises. The Featherlite Shell Jacket with eVent DVStorm membrane technology weighs 298 g in Size M and is a fully featured alpine climbing shell. It will give you the freedom of movement and protection you need during stormy ascents or even climbing the sky, as I so aptly demonstrate here.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14719577775" title="Montane Featherlite Shell Jacket by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2922/14719577775_94dd174a9d_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Montane Featherlite Shell Jacket" /></a></p>

<p>The Habu 22 is one of two new Montane packs for women (the other one is the Yarará 32). It’s 917 g light and is a versatile pack that’s suited to any activity you might want to do with it: Strap your ice tools to it and go ice climbing or take it on a summer ultra distance run. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14717190954" title="Montane habu 22 pack by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2931/14717190954_cb11afd2a5_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Montane habu 22 pack" /></a></p>

<p>The Rapide Softshell Jacket has a hood that stows away in the collar. On your head it has a snug fit and won’t flap annoying around while you’re running in the drizzle, and it weighs 346 g. </p>

<h2 id="nemo-equipment">NEMO Equipment</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.nemoequipment.com/">NEMO Equipment</a> has 8 new tents coming out in 2015, one tarp, and a whole bunch of more gear. The Dagger 2P is a 1,6 kg two person tent with two doors and two vestibules. Features include an overhead pocket light and a privacy panel on the inner tent. It did look nice and 1,6 kg for a 2P tent is reasonable. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14697110576" title="NEMO Equipment Dagger 2P by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5581/14697110576_b2c26b1973_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="NEMO Equipment Dagger 2P" /></a></p>

<p>However, the Blaze 2P (that name reminds me of a club I used to go as a student =) is a 2P tent with a minimum weight of 910 g. That’s already a serious number for ultralighters. Add in that there’s two doors and also two vestibules and it’s much the same as the Dagger above, just lighter! It’s achieved by the pole construction - there’s one pole that goes corner-to-corner while a short pole on top creates a large interior living space. NEMO says they will be waterproof, durable and tear-resistant, so this really could be a interesting 2P tent to check out next year.</p>

<p>But NEMO Equipment also makes quilts and sleeping bags. The Tango Solo 30 (there’s a Tango Duo, too) is their new quilt. 810 g light, filled with 330 g DownTek treated 700 cuin down it has a comfort rating of -1°C. Interesting was the hood which you can slide under your pad and then connect the quilt to it via push buttons, this way the quilt stays in place and possibly drafts are minimized.</p>

<h2 id="black-diamond">Black Diamond</h2>

<p><a href="http://blackdiamondequipment.com/">Black Diamond</a> had a load of new gear so here some highlights. The ladies get a <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/05/black-diamond-alpine-start-hoody.html">Alpine Start Hoody</a> and the Men some new colours.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/05/black-diamond-ultra-distance-trekking-poles.html">Distance Carbon Z</a> got a new hand loop and the Distance Carbon FLZ gets a FlickLock Pro in addition, giving it a very compact pack size and an easy way to adjust the length. </p>

<p>The Index is their new ascender. It has a trigger-finger slot to help you manipulate the cam for easier operation, a dual-density grip and a large clip hole lets locking carabiners rotate 360-degrees to eliminate the possibility of cross loading. </p>

<p>The Axis 24 is a technical all-mountain daypack and features a zippered top-loading design and the reACTIV suspension for added comfort. Crampon straps, ice tool pocket and attachment, hydration compatible, removable hipbelt.</p>

<p>The Pipe Dream 45 is a crag pack that carrie sall your kir and functions then as a start pad for bouldering or a place to keep your gear spread out and not get dirty.</p>

<h2 id="exped">Exped</h2>

<p>The Swiss brand <a href="http://www.exped.com/finland/">Exped</a> had a wide selection of new gear. The Summit Lite 15 is new for 2015 and is the small brother of the already available Summit Lite 25. The 15 weighs 290 g and the 25 310 g, both pack flat away in the lid in a minute. They’re made of Triple Ripstop Nylon and have Daisychains and once ice axe look, so are well suited to work as a summit pack. There’s even a stretch outside pocket!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14719889682" title="Exped Summit Lite 25 by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3926/14719889682_18a3f743da_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Exped Summit Lite 25" /></a>

<p>The Thunder comes in a 50 and 70 l volume size, and does remind me a bit of past GoLite packs. These 1400 g or 1490 g respectively, three entries to the main compartment stretch mesh side and front pockets and side compressison straps which also can be used across the front. Maybe something for long backcountry trips where you carry a lot of food?</p>

<p>The Downmat TT is an expedition pad with interchangeable insulation tubes. It’s pretty versatile: You can adjust the width by leaving tubes out choose between down or synthetic tubes for the insulation you need for the trip in question. The regular length (184 cm) is 840 g and has an R-Value of 8. It has five years of warranty and the Octupus Inflation bag is included. You’ll pay 260€ for the M length.</p>

<p>Lighter and likely more interesting for the majority of readers here is the Winterlite pad. The 180 cm long pad is 495 g light and has the same R-Value as the Expedition TT: 8. It’s claimed to keep you insulated down to -38°C and has a small pack size, too. It comes with a nozzle pump sack which also works as the stuff sack and will start at 220€.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14533742847" title="Exped Winterlite by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3910/14533742847_7000b0ed9e_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Exped Winterlite" /></a></p>

<p>The Synmat Hyperlite is 330 g light in 180 cm length and has still an R-Value of 3.1. The pack size is pretty good too as you can see, and it will cost 150€.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14720185875" title="Exped Synmat Hyperlite by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3856/14720185875_9558534b17_b.jpg" width="1024" height="430" alt="Exped Synmat Hyperlite" /></a></p>

<p>Finally, SIM Hyperlite is a self-inflating pad that come sin three sizes. An R-Value of 3.2 keeps you warm till -5°C and with a weight of 370 g for the Torso length mat it’s still lightweight (the 183 cm long pad is 520 g). They’ll cost between 80 and 100€.</p>

<h2 id="nw-alpine">NW Alpine</h2>

<p><a href="http://nwalpine.com/">NW Alpine</a> hails from Portland, Oregon and is one of many innovative companies from that area. The Eyebright Jacket I’m wearing there is a breathable cuben fibre jacket that tips the scales at 140 g. It has a climbing-specific fit and will get some minor updates for the next season. Other new garments include a Polartec Alpha Hoody, Jacket and pants, a couple of normal pants, a new Men’s and Women’s WPB Jacket and several more garments - all made in Portland. </p>

<h2 id="vargo">Vargo</h2>

<p>On the shuttle bus from the Airport to Friedrichshafen I had the good luck to sit next to Brian <a href="http://www.vargooutdoors.com/">Vargo</a> and so we had a interesting discussion during the two hour ride to the fair grounds. During the weekend I then swung by to see the new gear he already had told me about on the bus, and it was good stuff. The Ti Flask with an integrated silicone funnel which fold down when not needed certainly was cool and I can see the use of this on long winter treks. Tasty Scottish whisky from a Ti flask? Yes please.</p>

<p>The Ti running crampons should be around 60 g for one and fold up when not needed. Eight spikes under the front and middle foot give grip on ice and snow and are easy to take off/ put on. </p>

<p>The Titanium external Frame with cuben compartment is 940 g light. Certainly a product for a very limited audience but I totally can see a market for it. You can strap a bear canister to the bottom and generally lash gear to the frame. The frame was comfy to wear and is the same as in the <a href="http://www.vargooutdoors.com/ti-arc-backpack.html">Ti-Arc pack</a> which has a pack from another material. Packrafters, hunters and bushcrafters and people who head for long time into the wild are most likely to find this pack attractive. </p>

<p>And then there was <a href="http://www.vargooutdoors.com/apparel.html">Titanium apparel</a>. Sadly it doesn’t make you Iron Man or his Titanium Brother, but it claims it has some good benefits like staying non-smelly and dry. Tests will show if this will be the case, though it’s an interesting development. Every UL backpacker loves Titanium, and the idea to wear it just plain awesome. </p>
