    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>That I like single wall shelters in all seasons isn’t a secret. And that I like pyramid shelters neither. So as <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=ml&amp;ti=462005&amp;pw=73183">Hyperlite Mountain Gear</a> said they’re going to send me an UltaMid 2, I was very much looking forward to trying this very spacious cuben pyramid shelter here in the north.</p>

<p><a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/09/hyperlite-mountain-gear-ultamid.html" title="HMG UltaMid"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7324/9708360775_3eec0c98f4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="HMG UltaMid" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Attention!</strong> All photos in this post are from an early Proto-type and the final design has changed a few details from this one. I will highlight these in the article where appropriate.</p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>The HMG UltaMid 2 arrived in May and has been used on <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/guided-trips/">packrafting and backpacking tours</a>, <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/07/climbing-at-havukallio.html">climbing weekends</a> and <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/09/urho-kekkonen-national-park.html">hiking in Lapland</a>. All in all I have slept over 15 nights under it, in the rain, wind and also during calm nights.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9253493494/" title="HMG UltaMid 2 at Havukallio"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7393/9253493494_bde30147bc_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="HMG UltaMid 2 at Havukallio" /></a></p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>As with other shelters, its function is to protect you and your gear from the elements. While on sunny, calm summer nights and days that’s not really needed, add in wind or the need for privacy and a shelter is useful to have along. Add in rain or snow and a dry place for sleeping, eating, and lounging looks very inviting indeed.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9519459009/" title="Ultralight camping by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3793/9519459009_f7441f5148_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Ultralight camping" /></a></p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>It’s HUGE. It has a very large footprint - about 270 cm long and 210 cm wide in my prototype - so should even offer tall people a very good amount of space to lay down without bumping into the walls. Add in the recommended pitching height of about 160 cm and you can already imagine that this is a shelter which offers a very large amount of space. If it’s good weather you can even pitch it a bit higher for lots of height and the possibility to dance around the pole.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9771035091/" title="Space by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7341/9771035091_35395339f0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Space" /></a></p>

<p>The production model comes with all the bells and whistles you could wish for: Line Locs for easy adjustment of the guylines, a Zipper Garage at the top and a Zipper Strain Relief buckle at the bottom. My prototype doesn’t have these, but I don’t miss them either. The zipper itself is of the waterproof-kind and is two-way and is easy going. It is placed on the short side, in the middle, which is a unique place as zippers often are placed on the long sides.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9797345306/" title="Side buckles to stow away the door"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7445/9797345306_304db878d1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Side buckles to stow away the door" /></a></p>

<p>The top has two vents with no-see-um mesh to keep insects out, and they can be closed, too - useful in vertical rain situations where the wind could drive the rain inside. Or snow. The door can be opened completely and stored away neatly with the buckles, which is perfect for calm evenings where you want to enjoy the views with some wind protection.</p>

<p>Watch the video to get an idea how large it is, and how easy to set up:</p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>Making such a large, durable shelter from cuben is an innovation, I’d say.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9797318235/" title="HMG!"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7363/9797318235_d6d8aef94b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="HMG!" /></a></p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>By now you hopefully know that HMG not only stands for ultralight, high quality gear, but that their kit is also durable. My prototype was used by others before me, and has been put through the paces by me and friends since. Except cosmetic looks - the cuben isn’t as white anymore as it was when new - it’s still in great shape and doesn’t show any signs of weakness. The zipper still runs smoothly and all seams and tie-out points are still strong.</p>

<p>Speaking of the seams, they are a mix of bonded and sewn: The large panels are sewn and taped, while critical seams like at the top and at the tie-out points are reinforced for extra durability. The top itself is made of Dyneema, and HMG says it is <em>special</em> as it will not deform. As I only have used poles and paddles and not skis I can’t comment on that, but it’s a sturdy design. It even has a loop on the top from where you could hang it from a tree, for 100% pole-free space inside!</p>

<p>It’s made from CF8 – ct2k08 cuben, which offers good durability and still is very lightweight. The material is 100% waterproof, doesn’t absorb water and small rips are easy to fix in the backcountry - I fixed other cuben kit with just a patch of Duct tape.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9797395273/" title="Top"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7443/9797395273_abbde85d28_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Top" /></a></p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>My Prototype UltaMid 2 weighs in at exactly 499 g including guylines. That’s 100 g more than my <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/02/locus-gear-khufu-sil-review.html">LOCUS GEAR Khufu Sil</a> but the UltaMid offers a lot more space. I imagine if switching to less burly guylines some additional weight could be saved. The packsack it comes in weighs 15 gram.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9797304215/" title="Easy to spot in the summer by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7402/9797304215_aecb3c1f35_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Easy to spot in the summer" /></a></p>

<h2 id="sustainability--recyclability">Sustainability &amp; Recyclability</h2>

<p>Cuben is a very expensive material, so you can be sure the HMG plans very carefully how to cut the material up for mids, <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2010/10/hmg-echo-i-review.html">Tarps</a>, stuff sacks et al. to minimize scraps.</p>

<p><em>More in the future.</em></p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p>As the UltaMid 2 arrived, I first thought HMG sent me the wrong Mid (they make a 4 Person Version). The shelter was so large that I was sure that there must have been a mistake. As I took it out to make a test pitch, I realized that HMG did indeed send me the right UltaMid, but that the 2 Person version is MASSIVE. I can fit an inflated packraft in there and lay down on it, or on the other side. Or spread out all my trad climbing gear on one side, while my sleep system is on the other side. Obviously thus that two people and their gear will fit in there just fine, and won’t feel that they’re too close as it could be in other shelters.</p>

<p>As with all pyramid shelters, preparation is key for a good pitch. Staking the UltaMid well out, in a good square, will make it go up perfectly. If the long sides are not aligned, or straight, it will be askew - easiest to then take the pole out again, align the sides correctly, and insert the pole again. Then you can go and stake out the mid tie-out points, and adjust the corners if needed.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9797392493/" title="Preparation is key"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7368/9797392493_e80346a244_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Preparation is key" /></a></p>

<p>Speaking of poles, I have been using the fantastic <a href="http://www.rutalocura.com/trekking_poles.html">Ruta Locura Yana poles</a> and my <a href="http://www.packrafting-store.de/Paddle/Sawyer-Packraft-Paddle::130.html">Sawyer paddle</a> to pitch the UltaMid. Three sections of the paddle do the trick, you then can adjust the length of the paddle for the height you want. Same goes for the Yana pole, I use three sections and with it I can pitch the mid very low or very high. If you use trekking poles and want to get the UltaMid, get the Yana Poles!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9797324484/" title="Can be pitched with a paddle"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5324/9797324484_e2b54bc554_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Can be pitched with a paddle" /></a>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9797268566/" title="Top with closed vents"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7381/9797268566_bd53c2634c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Top with closed vents" /></a></p>

<p>If it comes to packing, folding is the way to go. I have just stuffed the UltaMid into is supplied cuben stuff sack, but it is difficult. Somehow the top hat makes the packing for me not easy, but if the whole shelter is nicely folded it goes in with plenty of room to spare. That said, you can stuff it in there, but then the package will be more bulky.</p>

<p>I really liked the placement of the zipper, and how wide you could open up the doors. As the zipper is placed on the short side, you enter the shelter from the “front” or “back” depending on in which direction you sleep. It makes getting in your bivy or inner very easy in my experience, and makes it easier to keep the shelter organized - one side for sleeping, the other for gear. In shelters where the door is on the long side, you often have the gear before or behind your sleep system, this works but the UltaMid certainly feels more organized.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9801226353/" title="Packed size"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5498/9801226353_1b4219791f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="662" alt="Packed size" /></a></p>

<p>I’m a bit torn about the guylines on the UltaMid. On the one hand they work very well - they’re long enough to use them with rocks or for high pitches, but on the other hand they’re pretty heavy. I wonder if using thinner lines would mean a sacrifice in usability? Something to try in the future. Saving some weight will be nice, too!</p>

<p>Hanging a bivy inside is also a bit odd. There’s two D-Rings on the side, but none at the front and back - where I usually lay with my head. For me a D-Ring or similar there would make hanging a bivy or mosquito net a lot easier, now it always involves a bit of fiddling around. If you’re the kind of person who likes to sleep in an inner tent, then you’ll probably want to ask Sean at <a href="http://oookworks.com/">OookWorks</a> if he can make one for you until HMG comes around with their own.</p>

<h2 id="competing-products">Competing Products</h2>

<p>There are many pyramid shelters on the market: The <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/02/locus-gear-khufu-sil-review.html">LOCUS GEAR Khufu Sil</a> which I like a lot, then there’s the <a href="http://www.mountainlaureldesigns.com/shop/product_info.php?cPath=47&amp;products_id=105">MLD DuoMid</a> &amp; <a href="http://shop.bivysack.com/category.sc?categoryId=4">Oware Alphamid</a>, the <a href="http://bit.ly/18ypYuZ">Black Diamond Mega Light Tent</a>, the <a href="http://www.bearpawwd.com/tents_tarps/pyraTent.html">Bear Paw Wilderness PyraTent</a>, the <a href="http://seekoutside.com/products/ultralight-tipis/little-bug-out-shelter/">Lil’ Bug Out Shelter</a> from Seek Outside and even the <a href="http://bit.ly/1eQ9Jmp">GoLite Shangri-La</a> is Pyramid-shaped.</p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>There’s much too like about the HMG UltaMid 2: It’s light, offers a fantastic amount of space, is very stable in high winds and is easy &amp; fast to pitch. Did I mention that it offers a lot of space? No? OK, the main selling point for the UltaMid 2 will be the massive amount of space it offers. If you hike in wet weather and want to sit in comfort in your shelter in the evening, then the UltaMid offers so much space that you can invite your friends over to your shelter for drinks. And all the very tall hikers will also like this shelter, because finally they can sit inside a shelter without having their head bump into the walls. Now I’m not one of those very tall hikers, but I still enjoyed sleeping in the UltaMid, as did taller friends I loaned it to.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9797271184/" title="View"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3795/9797271184_0079dbd7ce_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="View" /></a></p>

<p>Sure, there’s some knick-knacks: The packing can be fiddly, and you’ll want to take a pole that can extend in comfort to 160 cm or more. Sure, a pole jack as you could make yourself or buy can help with shorter poles, but it’s not a 100% good solution in high winds in my opinion. Packrafters will just use their paddles, skiers can use their skis in a an inverted V shape, or if you hike in the forest you’ll just look for a place where you can hang it via the top loop. Also the price of $650 is not for small budgets, but then this is truly a four season shelter which will have you covered in all environments. For me it’s really a superb shelter that I love to take along. On <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/guided-trips/">guided trips</a> it’s excellent to show my clients that there are sub-500 gram ultralight shelters which are durable, stable in the wind, easy to pitch and offer plenty of space. If that sounds like you’d enjoy it, get one!</p>

I decided to give a new brand a try, and just a couple of days before I flew to Slovenia blue <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/salomon-speedcross-3-laufschuhe/">Salomon Speedcross 3</a> trailrunners arrived. <em>A living Review.</em></p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>
<p>The Speedcross 3 have been used since July 2012, on the UL Summit in Slovenia, overnighters, cycling, and pretty much every day that “normal” shoes weren’t necessary. They’ve been walked in over 1000 km since (<a href="http://www.moves-app.com/">Moves App</a> is wonderful!) and still have a bit of grip and use left in them.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7992324507/" title="Edelweiss vs. Salmon Speedcross 3 by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8458/7992324507_f2c6123b86_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Edelweiss vs. Salmon Speedcross 3" /></a></p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>
<p>They’re trailrunning shoes. 90% of the time I use them for normal walking and hiking, though. They have a little bit more grip on wet rocks and muddy trails than wearing no shoes, are a little warmer in the snow, offer a little more protection against sharp stones, stinging insects and plants. If you are outdoors, shoes are a useful thing to wear, unless you’re a follower of the barefoot movement.</p>

<h2 id="fit">Fit</h2>
<p>The Quicklace closure is so excellent, that I used it exactly once: The day I put the shoes on for the first time. I like to wear my shoes a bit on the lose, so that they’re easy to slip in but still offer enough hold to run or scramble in. Other shoes with conventional laces I needed to re-tie every now and then, but the Speedcross 3s have been tightened once. I like that. Otherwise they’re a good fit for my feet: Nice tight in the heel, plenty of space for the toes and good support and hold in the middle. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7905246334/" title="Salomon Speedcross 3 by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8321/7905246334_09490b80be_b.jpg" width="1024" height="654" alt="Salomon Speedcross 3" /></a></p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>
<p>The Quicklace system I’d need to mention here, at least I haven’t seen anything like it on other shoes before or after. The shoes have cleats which I haven’t seen used by other brands.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7987729999/" title="Quicklace system by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8436/7987729999_982e9ed042_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Quicklace system" /></a></p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>
<p>The Speedcross 3 are high quality shoes, just the fact that I have been walking well over 1000 km in them and they’re still in a good shape speaks for them. The mesh upper is still 100% fine, the cushioning still works well but the cleats start to get rather small as I use them a lot walking on streets.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7906161102/" title="Salomon Speedcross 3 by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8298/7906161102_28e2e10aa5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Salomon Speedcross 3" /></a></p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>
<p>The pair of them, in Size 42, weighs 614 g or 307 g per shoe. They’re not the lightest trailrunning shoes, but still are acceptable.</p>

<h2 id="sustainability--recyclability">Sustainability &amp; Recyclability</h2>
<p>Salomon has an <a href="http://www.salomonrunning.com/ir/environment.html">Environment</a> page on their website. Information is brief, very brief: 91 words were spent on letting us know that the company want to reduce their CO2 Emissions, eliminate toxicity in their products and that they want to develop <em>products and processes which are environmentally friendly throughout their life-cycle</em>. <strong>How</strong> they think to go about that all, well, it’s a mystery (as is putting the dot at the beginning of their sentences).</p>

<p>Recyclability, either you drop them in a container where they collect old footwear, or drop them off at the shop you bought them. They’re made of oil-based materials and rubber, so don’t belong in the rubbish bin.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7987742893/" title="On the rocks by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8451/7987742893_148711c415_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="On the rocks" /></a></p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>
<p>The Speedcross 3 shoes have seen plenty of different terrain and usage: Fording rivers, climbing peaks, walking on rubble paths, muddy paths, tarmac, forest roads, cycling, running. In all of these situation I never felt like I’d like to be wearing another shoe - they’re great allrounders which suit a multitude of undergrounds and activities.</p>

<p>I was sceptical of the Quicklace system, though in case it didn’t become clear yet: I really like it. Being able to fasten my shoes once and then just slip in each day in the morning and slip out in the evening is very convenient. The small pocket which takes the closure mechanism does the job well, and it’s for people who don’t like tying their shoes or having their shoelaces come undone at the most unfortunate times a real solution. While I’m not sure if my next shoes will be Salomons, I am sure I will be missing the convenience of the Quicklace system.</p>

<p>The Speedcross 3 are almost 90 g heavier than the X-Talon 190s and I can feel the difference if I have one of each on my feet. They’re not uncomfortable heavy, though. They also have slightly more cushioning, which is OK. I need to pay more attention to walking ball first, though (I strike slightly behind the ball first when walking, when running more in the front). If you are aiming to strike with your fore-foot first, then the Speedcross 3 are OK but shoes with less cushioning could be preferable.</p>

<p>The shoes dry reasonably fast. Because they have a bit of insulation - it’s not just mesh like the X-Talon - they keep moisture longer than the aforementioned shoes, but in cold weather - I have been wearing the Speedcross 3 throughout winter - they are warmer. That’s probably also a reason why in very hot weather (over 20°C) I got slightly sweaty feet in the Speedcross 3, but overall they were a good mix of insulation, breathability and drying.</p>

<p>I climbed a 2569 m peak in the Alps in the Speedcross 3 and climbed/ scrambled an almost vertical section up with them. They were just fine, I wished more I would have a Via-Ferrata Set to clip myself in than other shoes. Doing over 2000 m of descent and ascent a day in them was no problem, either - lots of grip on all undergrounds was found, and no injuries were incurred, ever. The only surface where I thought they didn’t have 100% grip was on wet and slimy rocks, but then very few shoes have. The Contragrip sole is very nice, by the way, and really works very well - in undergrounds like mud and snow you’re not slipping in them when hiking/ running down or up. </p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>
<p>I have been a loyal Inov-8 user for many years, but last year decided to try the Salomon shoes. One of the reasons was that many mates on the <a href="http://www.ultraleicht-trekking.com/forum/">Ultraleicht Trekking Forum</a> have been speaking very positively about Salomon trailrunners for backpacking, and I was ready for something new. </p>

<p>The Salomon Speedcross 3 was a bit of a spontaneous buy, right before a major trip, but they have been nothing but splendid. I like the colour (and the shoes come in plenty of great colours!), the grip, the Quicklace system, the fit and and high quality. While they’re heavier than my X-Talon 190s they’re a lot more durable, which might be a good reason to get them if you want a shoe that lasts more than 500 km. I imagine if you use this shoe solely for hiking and trailrunning on trails, and walk little on streets, then you can make them last surely for 1500 km or more. All in all a great shoe, and I’m strongly considering to get a new pair - in another, cool colour =)</p>

<p><strong>Ladies:</strong> There’s a <a href="http://bit.ly/10xmYSF">female version</a> of this shoe available, and also one with <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/salomon-womens-speedcross-3-cs-trailrunningschuhe/">ClimaShield</a> in case you want to use the shoes in winter. </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ines Papert was, despite her being German, sponsored by Black Diamond and Arc’teryx and having won four World Cups in ice climbing, not a familiar name to me. I stumbled across her book <a href="http://www.delius-klasing.de/buecher/sport-fussball/outdoor/Vertikal.110940.html">VERTICAL: Life on the Steepest Faces</a> by coincidence, and was positively surprised by the interesting story of this woman, and the superb mountain photography.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8207029608/" title="VERTICAL: Life on the Steepest Faces by Ines Papert by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8481/8207029608_9b1cf50b3d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="VERTICAL: Life on the Steepest Faces by Ines Papert" /></a></p>

<p>As the book arrived, I was again surprised by the huge size of it. 30 cm wide and 27 cm high, it is a big book, but this size comes into its own when you can view photos in such a great size. In twelve chapters and 160 pages the book takes you on a trip around the world, seeing the high peaks of Nepal &amp; India, remote locations in Canada and familiar mountains in Norway and Scotland. There is little text, and so your main attention is drawn to the photos. These are indeed very fine, and any mountain, outdoors, and photography lover will appreciate the inspiring photos from across the world.</p>

<p>The book starts out and gives you a bit of background on Ines, who started climbing in her twenties but displayed such massive amounts of talent that she only a year after she started climbing already stood on the summit of Aconcagua, Americas highest peak. Three years later she ranked second in the World Cup, and in 2001 she got her first (of four) World Champion title. Happily the book focuses less on her competitive time, and more on her expeditions.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8205933277/" title="VERTICAL: Life on the Steepest Faces by Ines Papert by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8063/8205933277_99f8806fb4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="VERTICAL: Life on the Steepest Faces by Ines Papert" /></a></p>

<p>On these we are taken to India, Nepal, Kyrgyzstan, China, Canada, the Arctic, Norway and Scotland. Different teams, and different photographers, but always a very human perspective on the story - not only reaching the summit is important, but also being safe and having a good time. In between these stories, there’s little nuggets of wisdom - how to go to a location, how to climb in Scotland, how to pick a good expedition team.</p>

<p>It is a quick read - I had it through in a couple of evenings - though I have been going back to watch the photos again on several occassions; they let you temporary escape the dull Finnish November to sunnier places with great mountains. If you love mountains &amp; the outsdoors but can’t be climbing and hiking all the time, then this book is a good way to get your fix. The female perspective on climbing, expeditions and the mountains is very refreshing, too. Have a friend who loves ice climbing and far away places? Then this would make a great gift!</p>

    <updated>2012-07-23T23:00:00+03:00</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7278041722/" title="Untitled by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7229/7278041722_d39009ce50_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Untitled" /></a></p>

<p>Observant readers will have noticed that I was very quick on my hiking trips in the last 16 months. That had less to do with an increase in fitness and speed on my end, but more with the colour of my shoes. It is a well known fact that red shoes make you walk faster, so the increased speed is due to the <a href="http://www.inov-8.com/New/Global/Product-View-XTalon-190.html?L=26">Inov-8 X-Talon 190</a> I was wearing. And while this is structured like a living review, these sweet trailrunners are nearing the end of their lifecycle, and might soon need to be brought to the place where trailrunners go to run on the eternal fjells. But before that happens, lets take a look at them.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>I received the Inov-8 X-Talon 190 in May 2012. I first wore them to my Wilderness Guide examination, and they have been on countless trips since. All in, I have hiked &amp; walked &amp; run close to 1000 km in them. I still use them, but will need to replace them <em>soon</em>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7278047148/" title="Inov-8 X-Talon 190 by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7233/7278047148_7efe69ffe5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Inov-8 X-Talon 190" /></a></p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>They’re shoes. They protect your feet from sharp stones, dust, debris, nettles and mosquitos. They also give you sweet grip on muddy trails, wet stones, protect your feet &amp; give you grip when fording a river, and also work well on snow and any other terrain I’ve encountered. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7621693060/" title="Insole, out by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7272/7621693060_d3fd59b741_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Insole, out" /></a></p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>It’s probably their lack of features that make them so good. Minimal cushioning makes you feel the trail you’re walking on, which means you have superb ground contact and can “feel” the terrain you’re walking on; something that I find positive when scrambling on rocks or jumping from boulder to boulder. When it is wet you can almost dig your toes into the mud, though their superb grip - thanks to the aggressive profile - does a good job on its own already.</p>

<p>The X-Talon 190 is flexible. Flexible as in <em>you can fold the shoe double</em> flexible. I really like that, and prefer it much more than a stiff sole. </p>

<p>The upper of the X-Talon 190 is super flexible mesh, pretty much all of it, except a tiny bit of a toe box (which does the job). That mesh is <em>breathable</em> - so breathable that when I go really fast on my bicycle that I can feel the wind on my feet! It also means that you’ll get wet feet in the rain, but on the plus side that they dry super fast. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7621715012/" title="Flexible by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8145/7621715012_e3140f8195_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Flexible" /></a></p>

<h2 id="fit">Fit</h2>

<p>Talking about how a shoe fits is always fun. The majority of people have two differently sized feet, so imagine me describing how a shoe fits my feet can help you. Ähem, yeah. I’ll try, though. I have a UK Size 8.5 which is the usual size I have in Inov-8 shoes, and they fit my normal/ narrow feet perfectly. That two-way stretchy mesh upper is giving a snug fit, with plenty of wiggle room for my toes. Wiggle room for my toes is important. The heel cup sits tight and low, and yes, it fits wonderful for me, too. I have worn the X-Talon 190s laced up tight and very loose, and in both configurations, the shoe sits great on my foot - both when walking and running. <em>So how would they fit you?</em> Because of that stretchy mesh upper, they have the possibility of extra space and apparently can comfortably accommodate also broad feet. Or so is my theory. Which I have backed up by reading reviews from people with broad feet. I know I know, usually on the Terrocs are fine for broad-feeted folks, though I think these could work because of the stretchy upper. </p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>Sticky rubber sole is sticky. Meshy mesh-upper is super breathable. Flexible shoe is flexible. Nope, no technical innovations, I’d say. But Inov-8 is the first company who has put these ingredients together to create a very good, very light shoe.</p>

<p>btw, Inov-8 says the sticky rubber on the sole of these shoes is similar to the rubber used in climbing shoes. </p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>Despite what you might think when you see the photos here, I can’t fault the quality of these shoes. 16 months of use and still going strong is good quality in my book. Sure, the aggressiveness of the lugs is less, they’re not as sticky &amp; rubbery as they were at the beginning, but they still give me decent grip and are comfortable to walk in. I think you’re getting an excellent pair of shoes for your money.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7278046330/" title="Inov-8 X-Talon 190 by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7238/7278046330_9829dd03de_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Inov-8 X-Talon 190" /></a></p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>221 grams per shoe. That makes them 442 grams for the pair, in said UK Size 8.5. They’re the second lightest shoes I own my (my <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2010/09/vibram-five-fingers-kso-first-look.html&quot;target=&quot;_blank&quot;">Vibram FiveFingers KSO</a> are the lightest ones).</p>

<h2 id="sustainability">Sustainability</h2>

<p>Inov-8 has a nice little story on their website entitled “<a href="http://www.inov-8.com/New/Global/Environment.html?L=26">Inov-8, the environment and climate change</a>”. Inov-8 has undergone an Environmental Footprint audit, and they tell us about their carbon footprint (Surprise: Shoes &amp; packaging account for only 17% of it - the biggest impact comes from staff travel). It reads nicely, but remember that this is still a product made from non-natural materials (I’m not sure if that’s right for the rubber, which might be natural?) and it won’t degrade easily if you throw it away. I also am not aware if Inov-8 offers any take-back of their shoes for recycling, or if there’s such a thing as shoe recycling.</p>

<p>Another aspect is the ethical question. The shoes are made in China, though that happily nowadays is more positive than in the past. Inov-8 also tell us about their <a href="http://www.inov-8.com/New/Global/Manufacturing-Ethics.html?L=26&quot;target=&quot;_blank&quot;">Manufacturing Ethics</a>, in which they highlight that there’s no child labour involved in the making of their products, and that employees are paid above average salaries; as well as some other stuff.</p>

<p>All in all I applaud that Inov-8 are transparent in their communications about these matters, though I’d welcome to see a Name &amp; Email there for interested people to contact them, as well as an indepentent source of the provided information for even more transparency.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7278047930/" title="Inov-8 X-Talon 190 by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7080/7278047930_3186f0a3c8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Inov-8 X-Talon 190" /></a></p>

<h2 id="recyclability">Recyclability</h2>

<p>A hard question, and one I should be able to answer soon - the shoes are close to being retired. I know that there are containers here in the city where you can bring old garments and shoes for recycling, though I am unsure of where they then end up. </p>

<h2 id="competing-products">Competing Products</h2>

<p>Besides Inov-8’s own <a href="http://www.inov-8.com/New/Global/Product-View-BareGrip-200.html?L=26">Bare Grip 200</a> and other models there are numerous competing products: There’s the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FWEU28/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=hikiinfinl-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B004FWEU28&quot;target=&quot;_blank&quot;">La Sportiva C-lite 2.0</a>, the <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/salomon-speedcross-3-laufschuhe/&quot;target=&quot;_blank&quot;">Salomon Speedcross 3</a> (more on them in the future), the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005F0XZ0M/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=hikiinfinl-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B005F0XZ0M&quot;target=&quot;_blank&quot;">Vivobarefoot Neo Trail</a>, among others. These all are heavier, though, and not as breathable.</p>

<h2 id="what-others-say">What Others Say</h2>

<p>Markus loves his <a href="http://ultraknilch.blogspot.fi/2010/09/inov-8-x-talon-190-erster-eindruck.html">X-Talon 190s</a> for hiking in the Alps and trailrunning. <a href="http://www.irunfar.com/2012/05/inov-8-x-talon-190-review.html&quot;target=&quot;_blank&quot;">Tom Caughlan from iRunFar.com</a> also think they’re excellent for trailrunning in the mountains.</p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>As I said, and as you’ve seen from my photos, my X-Talon 190s are close to the end of their lifecycle; yet I still use them almost daily - they’re just too comfy and when I head out I happily slip into my fast, red shoes. So while I have replaced them for the moment with a pair of (slower) blue <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/salomon-speedcross-3-laufschuhe/&quot;target=&quot;_blank&quot;">Salomon Speedcross 3</a> which hopefully arrive in time for the Ultralight Summit, I am looking for good a good deal on these shoes to get a new pair. Except in (our cold Finnish) winter the X-Talon 190 are perfect for three season ultralight backpacking - great grip, comfortable, breathable, quick drying. If you’re in the market for a new pair of shoes, then consider these.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During my education to become a Wilderness Guide, I was in need of a pair of binoculars for bird watching and nature observation. While there are plenty of companies who make high quality binoculars, I ended up with a pair of &lt;a href=”http://www.vortexoptics.com/product/vortex-viper-hd-8x32-binocular”target=”_blank”&gt;Vortex Optics Viper HD 8x32 Binoculars&lt;/a&gt;, which were for me the best combination of quality, weight, and viewing.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7196857430/" title="Vortex Viper by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8008/7196857430_31f07eb48c_c.jpg" width="800" height="342" alt="Vortex Viper" /></a></p>

<p>You might wonder why I got a pair of binos instead of a much lighter and smaller monocular. This is mostly because the binos came on trips where I was working as a Guide and birdwatching trips, where weight and size were of less concern. A pair of binos is just much easier to handle for a client, because they’re familiar with how it works: Hold it to both your eyes, adjust and see. Being able to hand your client a good pair of binos, which allows them to see that Black Woodpecker you just spotted, is making their experience just so much better. Also for kids a pair of binos is much easier to use, as they can hold it with both hands to their eyes, allowing for a more stable view (the same goes for adults, obviously =). It is very rewarding to see their faces light up when they look through the glass and see that bird you just pointed out to them!</p>

<p>So yes, binos. The Viper HD uses roof prisms, which allow for a more compact and narrow design. To counter the reduced light transmission this design has (in comparison with Porro-prisms), Vortex has developed and applied a bunch of very smart features. Multi-layer coatings provide the clearest, brightest, most color-accurate images possible, while XR anti-reflective coatings increase light transmission for maximum brightness. Phase Correction enhances resolution and contrast, and HD extra-low dispersion glass deliver an impressive resolution and color fidelity, resulting in High Definition images - that’s what they claim, and what I can confirm. Add in that the fixed alignment in roof-prism designs means the binoculars normally won’t need re-collimation (re-aligning of the prisms), and in the long-term you’re possibly even saving money.</p>

<p>The Viper binos are waterproof and fogproof; while I haven’t submersed them to test the former, the fogproofness has been tested on countless occasions. The exterior lenses have an ArmorTek coating, which makes them less prone to scratches, oil and dirt - not that I’m carrying them around carelessly, though it is good to know that when by accident they’d drop on the ground, or in a stiff breeze at the beach, they’re protected. The rubber outer provides a non-slip grip, and also gives you the durable external protection you want.</p>

<p>All this high-tech and durability obvious comes at a cost. At 663 gram, including tethered objective lens covers for both ends and the Comfort neck strap, I don’t consider the Viper ultralight, but it is still one of the most durable &amp; lightest binos on the market. While the 90 gram of the padded carrying case aren’t really necessary (it are very rugged binos), it is a good extra protection.</p>

<p>So much for the tech and weight of the Viper HD binos; but how are they in use? After almost a year of using them in various situations - from a &lt;a href=”http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2012/01/archipelago-national-park-trip-report.html”target=”_blank”&gt;bird watching trip in the Archipelago&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=”http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2011/09/upitrek-family-trip-guiding.html”target=”_blank”&gt;using them at work guiding clients&lt;/a&gt;, they always have been dependable, delivering sharp views on far away wildlife. It is especially when outside with clients a very useful tool, because a good pair of binoculars that you can give your client in the hand, allowing them for example to see that White-tailed Eagle sailing high above you, is something that will help make their outdoor experience much more memorable, if not unforgettable. The twist eyecups help here to allow for a comfortable custom fit when looking through them, and with the very easy to use Diopter people can quick &amp; easy adjusts for differences in their eyes. The Center Focus Wheel of the binos lets one quickly adjust the focus, and even kids know immediately how to use them. The Viper easily adjust in the middle to different widths so that they also work perfectly for kids.</p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>
<p>A highly functional pair of binoculars, made for the outdoors, for observing wildlife and looking far away, in a small, compact and reasonably light package. At &lt; $500 they’re not cheap, but you invest into a high quality piece of kit that your kids can inherit. And should something go broken, then Vortex’s &lt;a href=”http://www.vortexoptics.com/content/vip_warranty”target=”_blank”&gt;VIP Unconditional Lifetime Warranty&lt;/a&gt; has you covered.
