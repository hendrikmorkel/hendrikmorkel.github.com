I decided to give a new brand a try, and just a couple of days before I flew to Slovenia blue <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/salomon-speedcross-3-laufschuhe/">Salomon Speedcross 3</a> trailrunners arrived. <em>A living Review.</em></p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>
<p>The Speedcross 3 have been used since July 2012, on the UL Summit in Slovenia, overnighters, cycling, and pretty much every day that “normal” shoes weren’t necessary. They’ve been walked in over 1000 km since (<a href="http://www.moves-app.com/">Moves App</a> is wonderful!) and still have a bit of grip and use left in them.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7992324507/" title="Edelweiss vs. Salmon Speedcross 3 by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8458/7992324507_f2c6123b86_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Edelweiss vs. Salmon Speedcross 3" /></a></p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>
<p>They’re trailrunning shoes. 90% of the time I use them for normal walking and hiking, though. They have a little bit more grip on wet rocks and muddy trails than wearing no shoes, are a little warmer in the snow, offer a little more protection against sharp stones, stinging insects and plants. If you are outdoors, shoes are a useful thing to wear, unless you’re a follower of the barefoot movement.</p>

<h2 id="fit">Fit</h2>
<p>The Quicklace closure is so excellent, that I used it exactly once: The day I put the shoes on for the first time. I like to wear my shoes a bit on the lose, so that they’re easy to slip in but still offer enough hold to run or scramble in. Other shoes with conventional laces I needed to re-tie every now and then, but the Speedcross 3s have been tightened once. I like that. Otherwise they’re a good fit for my feet: Nice tight in the heel, plenty of space for the toes and good support and hold in the middle. </p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>
<p>The Quicklace system I’d need to mention here, at least I haven’t seen anything like it on other shoes before or after. The shoes have cleats which I haven’t seen used by other brands.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7987729999/" title="Quicklace system by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8436/7987729999_982e9ed042_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Quicklace system" /></a></p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>
<p>The Speedcross 3 are high quality shoes, just the fact that I have been walking well over 1000 km in them and they’re still in a good shape speaks for them. The mesh upper is still 100% fine, the cushioning still works well but the cleats start to get rather small as I use them a lot walking on streets.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7906161102/" title="Salomon Speedcross 3 by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8298/7906161102_28e2e10aa5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Salomon Speedcross 3" /></a></p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>
<p>The pair of them, in Size 42, weighs 614 g or 307 g per shoe. They’re not the lightest trailrunning shoes, but still are acceptable.</p>

<h2 id="sustainability--recyclability">Sustainability &amp; Recyclability</h2>
<p>Salomon has an <a href="http://www.salomonrunning.com/ir/environment.html">Environment</a> page on their website. Information is brief, very brief: 91 words were spent on letting us know that the company want to reduce their CO2 Emissions, eliminate toxicity in their products and that they want to develop <em>products and processes which are environmentally friendly throughout their life-cycle</em>. <strong>How</strong> they think to go about that all, well, it’s a mystery (as is putting the dot at the beginning of their sentences).</p>

<p>Recyclability, either you drop them in a container where they collect old footwear, or drop them off at the shop you bought them. They’re made of oil-based materials and rubber, so don’t belong in the rubbish bin.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7987742893/" title="On the rocks by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8451/7987742893_148711c415_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="On the rocks" /></a></p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>
<p>The Speedcross 3 shoes have seen plenty of different terrain and usage: Fording rivers, climbing peaks, walking on rubble paths, muddy paths, tarmac, forest roads, cycling, running. In all of these situation I never felt like I’d like to be wearing another shoe - they’re great allrounders which suit a multitude of undergrounds and activities.</p>

<p>I was sceptical of the Quicklace system, though in case it didn’t become clear yet: I really like it. Being able to fasten my shoes once and then just slip in each day in the morning and slip out in the evening is very convenient. The small pocket which takes the closure mechanism does the job well, and it’s for people who don’t like tying their shoes or having their shoelaces come undone at the most unfortunate times a real solution. While I’m not sure if my next shoes will be Salomons, I am sure I will be missing the convenience of the Quicklace system.</p>

<p>The Speedcross 3 are almost 90 g heavier than the X-Talon 190s and I can feel the difference if I have one of each on my feet. They’re not uncomfortable heavy, though. They also have slightly more cushioning, which is OK. I need to pay more attention to walking ball first, though (I strike slightly behind the ball first when walking, when running more in the front). If you are aiming to strike with your fore-foot first, then the Speedcross 3 are OK but shoes with less cushioning could be preferable.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7807588712/" title="You can't climb mountains in trailrunners by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7131/7807588712_df00e66139_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="You can't climb mountains in trailrunners" /></a></p>

<p>The shoes dry reasonably fast. Because they have a bit of insulation - it’s not just mesh like the X-Talon - they keep moisture longer than the aforementioned shoes, but in cold weather - I have been wearing the Speedcross 3 throughout winter - they are warmer. That’s probably also a reason why in very hot weather (over 20°C) I got slightly sweaty feet in the Speedcross 3, but overall they were a good mix of insulation, breathability and drying.</p>

<p>I climbed a 2569 m peak in the Alps in the Speedcross 3 and climbed/ scrambled an almost vertical section up with them. They were just fine, I wished more I would have a Via-Ferrata Set to clip myself in than other shoes. Doing over 2000 m of descent and ascent a day in them was no problem, either - lots of grip on all undergrounds was found, and no injuries were incurred, ever. The only surface where I thought they didn’t have 100% grip was on wet and slimy rocks, but then very few shoes have. The Contragrip sole is very nice, by the way, and really works very well - in undergrounds like mud and snow you’re not slipping in them when hiking/ running down or up. </p>

<h2 id="what-others-say">What Others Say</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.uptothetop.de/2012/12/01/salomon-speedcross-3/">Steve from Up To The Top</a> rates them very high, as does <a href="http://www.irunfar.com/2012/01/salomon-speedcross-3-review.html">Tom from iRunFar.com</a>. </p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>
<p>I have been a loyal Inov-8 user for many years, but last year decided to try the Salomon shoes. One of the reasons was that many mates on the <a href="http://www.ultraleicht-trekking.com/forum/">Ultraleicht Trekking Forum</a> have been speaking very positively about Salomon trailrunners for backpacking, and I was ready for something new. </p>

<p>The Salomon Speedcross 3 was a bit of a spontaneous buy, right before a major trip, but they have been nothing but splendid. I like the colour (and the shoes come in plenty of great colours!), the grip, the Quicklace system, the fit and and high quality. While they’re heavier than my X-Talon 190s they’re a lot more durable, which might be a good reason to get them if you want a shoe that lasts more than 500 km. I imagine if you use this shoe solely for hiking and trailrunning on trails, and walk little on streets, then you can make them last surely for 1500 km or more. All in all a great shoe, and I’m strongly considering to get a new pair - in another, cool colour =)</p>

<p><strong>Ladies:</strong> There’s a <a href="http://bit.ly/10xmYSF">female version</a> of this shoe available, and also one with <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/salomon-womens-speedcross-3-cs-trailrunningschuhe/">ClimaShield</a> in case you want to use the shoes in winter. </p>

<p>Observant readers will have noticed that I was very quick on my hiking trips in the last 16 months. That had less to do with an increase in fitness and speed on my end, but more with the colour of my shoes. It is a well known fact that red shoes make you walk faster, so the increased speed is due to the <a href="http://www.inov-8.com/New/Global/Product-View-XTalon-190.html?L=26">Inov-8 X-Talon 190</a> I was wearing. And while this is structured like a living review, these sweet trailrunners are nearing the end of their lifecycle, and might soon need to be brought to the place where trailrunners go to run on the eternal fjells. But before that happens, lets take a look at them.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>I received the Inov-8 X-Talon 190 in May 2012. I first wore them to my Wilderness Guide examination, and they have been on countless trips since. All in, I have hiked &amp; walked &amp; run close to 1000 km in them. I still use them, but will need to replace them <em>soon</em>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7278047148/" title="Inov-8 X-Talon 190 by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7233/7278047148_7efe69ffe5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Inov-8 X-Talon 190" /></a></p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>They’re shoes. They protect your feet from sharp stones, dust, debris, nettles and mosquitos. They also give you sweet grip on muddy trails, wet stones, protect your feet &amp; give you grip when fording a river, and also work well on snow and any other terrain I’ve encountered. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7621693060/" title="Insole, out by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7272/7621693060_d3fd59b741_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Insole, out" /></a></p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>It’s probably their lack of features that make them so good. Minimal cushioning makes you feel the trail you’re walking on, which means you have superb ground contact and can “feel” the terrain you’re walking on; something that I find positive when scrambling on rocks or jumping from boulder to boulder. When it is wet you can almost dig your toes into the mud, though their superb grip - thanks to the aggressive profile - does a good job on its own already.</p>

<p>The X-Talon 190 is flexible. Flexible as in <em>you can fold the shoe double</em> flexible. I really like that, and prefer it much more than a stiff sole. </p>

<p>The upper of the X-Talon 190 is super flexible mesh, pretty much all of it, except a tiny bit of a toe box (which does the job). That mesh is <em>breathable</em> - so breathable that when I go really fast on my bicycle that I can feel the wind on my feet! It also means that you’ll get wet feet in the rain, but on the plus side that they dry super fast. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7621715012/" title="Flexible by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8145/7621715012_e3140f8195_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Flexible" /></a></p>

<h2 id="fit">Fit</h2>

<p>Talking about how a shoe fits is always fun. The majority of people have two differently sized feet, so imagine me describing how a shoe fits my feet can help you. Ähem, yeah. I’ll try, though. I have a UK Size 8.5 which is the usual size I have in Inov-8 shoes, and they fit my normal/ narrow feet perfectly. That two-way stretchy mesh upper is giving a snug fit, with plenty of wiggle room for my toes. Wiggle room for my toes is important. The heel cup sits tight and low, and yes, it fits wonderful for me, too. I have worn the X-Talon 190s laced up tight and very loose, and in both configurations, the shoe sits great on my foot - both when walking and running. <em>So how would they fit you?</em> Because of that stretchy mesh upper, they have the possibility of extra space and apparently can comfortably accommodate also broad feet. Or so is my theory. Which I have backed up by reading reviews from people with broad feet. I know I know, usually on the Terrocs are fine for broad-feeted folks, though I think these could work because of the stretchy upper. </p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>Sticky rubber sole is sticky. Meshy mesh-upper is super breathable. Flexible shoe is flexible. Nope, no technical innovations, I’d say. But Inov-8 is the first company who has put these ingredients together to create a very good, very light shoe.</p>

<p>btw, Inov-8 says the sticky rubber on the sole of these shoes is similar to the rubber used in climbing shoes. </p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>Despite what you might think when you see the photos here, I can’t fault the quality of these shoes. 16 months of use and still going strong is good quality in my book. Sure, the aggressiveness of the lugs is less, they’re not as sticky &amp; rubbery as they were at the beginning, but they still give me decent grip and are comfortable to walk in. I think you’re getting an excellent pair of shoes for your money.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7278046330/" title="Inov-8 X-Talon 190 by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7238/7278046330_9829dd03de_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Inov-8 X-Talon 190" /></a></p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>221 grams per shoe. That makes them 442 grams for the pair, in said UK Size 8.5. They’re the second lightest shoes I own my (my <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2010/09/vibram-five-fingers-kso-first-look.html&quot;target=&quot;_blank&quot;">Vibram FiveFingers KSO</a> are the lightest ones).</p>

<h2 id="sustainability">Sustainability</h2>

<p>Inov-8 has a nice little story on their website entitled “<a href="http://www.inov-8.com/New/Global/Environment.html?L=26">Inov-8, the environment and climate change</a>”. Inov-8 has undergone an Environmental Footprint audit, and they tell us about their carbon footprint (Surprise: Shoes &amp; packaging account for only 17% of it - the biggest impact comes from staff travel). It reads nicely, but remember that this is still a product made from non-natural materials (I’m not sure if that’s right for the rubber, which might be natural?) and it won’t degrade easily if you throw it away. I also am not aware if Inov-8 offers any take-back of their shoes for recycling, or if there’s such a thing as shoe recycling.</p>

<p>Another aspect is the ethical question. The shoes are made in China, though that happily nowadays is more positive than in the past. Inov-8 also tell us about their <a href="http://www.inov-8.com/New/Global/Manufacturing-Ethics.html?L=26&quot;target=&quot;_blank&quot;">Manufacturing Ethics</a>, in which they highlight that there’s no child labour involved in the making of their products, and that employees are paid above average salaries; as well as some other stuff.</p>

<p>All in all I applaud that Inov-8 are transparent in their communications about these matters, though I’d welcome to see a Name &amp; Email there for interested people to contact them, as well as an indepentent source of the provided information for even more transparency.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7278047930/" title="Inov-8 X-Talon 190 by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7080/7278047930_3186f0a3c8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Inov-8 X-Talon 190" /></a></p>

<h2 id="recyclability">Recyclability</h2>

<p>A hard question, and one I should be able to answer soon - the shoes are close to being retired. I know that there are containers here in the city where you can bring old garments and shoes for recycling, though I am unsure of where they then end up. </p>

<h2 id="competing-products">Competing Products</h2>

<p>Besides Inov-8’s own <a href="http://www.inov-8.com/New/Global/Product-View-BareGrip-200.html?L=26">Bare Grip 200</a> and other models there are numerous competing products: There’s the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FWEU28/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=hikiinfinl-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B004FWEU28&quot;target=&quot;_blank&quot;">La Sportiva C-lite 2.0</a>, the <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/salomon-speedcross-3-laufschuhe/&quot;target=&quot;_blank&quot;">Salomon Speedcross 3</a> (more on them in the future), the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005F0XZ0M/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=hikiinfinl-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B005F0XZ0M&quot;target=&quot;_blank&quot;">Vivobarefoot Neo Trail</a>, among others. These all are heavier, though, and not as breathable.</p>

<p>Markus loves his <a href="http://ultraknilch.blogspot.fi/2010/09/inov-8-x-talon-190-erster-eindruck.html">X-Talon 190s</a> for hiking in the Alps and trailrunning. <a href="http://www.irunfar.com/2012/05/inov-8-x-talon-190-review.html&quot;target=&quot;_blank&quot;">Tom Caughlan from iRunFar.com</a> also think they’re excellent for trailrunning in the mountains.</p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>As I said, and as you’ve seen from my photos, my X-Talon 190s are close to the end of their lifecycle; yet I still use them almost daily - they’re just too comfy and when I head out I happily slip into my fast, red shoes. So while I have replaced them for the moment with a pair of (slower) blue <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/salomon-speedcross-3-laufschuhe/&quot;target=&quot;_blank&quot;">Salomon Speedcross 3</a> which hopefully arrive in time for the Ultralight Summit, I am looking for good a good deal on these shoes to get a new pair. Except in (our cold Finnish) winter the X-Talon 190 are perfect for three season ultralight backpacking - great grip, comfortable, breathable, quick drying. If you’re in the market for a new pair of shoes, then consider these.</p>
