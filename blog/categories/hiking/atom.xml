In the rain &amp; sunshine, up high in the mountains and low in the valleys.</p>

<h2 id="rain--misery">Rain &amp; Misery</h2>

<p>As we wake up at the <a href="http://www.piecstawow.pl/en/">Przedni Staw Polski Refuge</a> and I look out from my window the mist hides the mountains and the rain drops leave little circles on the lake. Everything is wet. Marcin and I silently get out of bed and move to the big common room, give in our orders for breakfast and enjoy the tasty food that comes through the small window from the kitchen. Slowly it gets busy, people packing, but with the rain keeping up a constant drum on the roof none leave the hut. At ten we’re the first ones to venture outside, curious looks on us in our rain gear, and as Marcin tells where we headed people just look even more confused.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15214238360" title="A look back by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2948/15214238360_3bfa19dbfb_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="A look back" /></a></p>

<p>Marcin gave me a few options: Walk the easy trail through the valley to the Schronisko Murowaniec refuge, or the shorter but high route across a pass at the end Orla Perć. We had light packs, good gear and so it was easy to make the decision to go via the pass. I either way was a bit disappointed that we didn’t take my original route, but plans are plans: Drawn on paper, dreamed up looking over maps in the warm comfort of home. When the weather turns it’s best to adapt them and stay safe - something I can now say in hindsight.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15400893955" title="Crossing snow by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3882/15400893955_db1585c08f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Crossing snow" /></a></p>

<p>We walk by the mist-enshrouded lakes, cross the stream via the little bridge and hear the waterfall thunder down towards the valley while we slowly ascend. I carry my camera underneath my jacket so I can keep on making photos, but in the drizzle and thick mist there isn’t much to see. We cross small streams, old snow, and steadily keep on walking uphill. Once in a while the mist has a gap and we can see a bit further - the other side of the valley, further up, down the valley.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15397714501" title="Slippery by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3855/15397714501_32e8d0e031_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Slippery" /></a></p>

<p>To be able to continue to take photos I left <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/hestra/">my gloves</a> in <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/07/patagonia-ascensionist-pack-45l.html">my pack</a> - a decision I regret the higher and windier it gets. I also ponder why I decided to put on my <a href="http://bit.ly/1BD2sfW">Alpha Comp Jacket</a> instead of my <a href="http://bit.ly/1rRRHpb">Patagonia Alpine Houdini</a> rain jacket as I start the get wet inside - or then it’s the sweat from hiking and scrambling up? At least I’m warm and the jacket and pants keep the wind outside. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15214147809" title="Up by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3901/15214147809_699c6e2391_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Up" /></a></p>

<p>We scramble up steep passages, rain and small streams making things slippery - it’s a good thing I’m wearing my <a href="http://bit.ly/1cLPRJN">Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX</a> boots, that way I have good grip on the wet rocks and half-way dry &amp; warm feet. Soaked we arrive at the pass and the wind howls past us. I shelter behind a big rock, but Marcin lets me know we should push on. So on we push.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14363720837" title="Wind. Rain. Honesty. by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3836/14363720837_7ac4627792_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Wind. Rain. Honesty." /></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15400901985" title="At the top by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3893/15400901985_9d8d44d8b1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="At the top" /></a></p>

<p>On the way up I thought about how nice it will be to go down in the downwind side. But I must have misunderstood Marcin, as we hike down on wet talus fields on the upwind side. At a narrow stretch of path between the talus I finally decide to go search for my gloves in my pack, as my hands started to be just too damn cold in the strong wind. When I finally have managed to get my soaking wet &amp; cold hands in the gloves they need a moment to warm up, but then it’s infinitely more comfortable. The same time I pack away my camera, so I can concentrate on the path. We down climbing a few sections and then slowly are getting lower. </p>

<p>We hike over snowfields and I can believe it as down, out of the treacherous wind, we see a solitary figuring coming our way, wearing a Poncho. Marcin chats with him, and as we continue to walk I hear a similar story like the ones I have heard the days before: First time in the mountains, wants to continue to the hut we started out from. A bit later we meet a couple who also have the same plan and think that now they’re at least three if they catch up with the guy, which makes it a bit safer. We pass a high-alpine lake and low pines are starting to appear. <em>“Not long anymore”</em> Marcin tells me - he must see that I’m not feeling too great: By now I’m drenched. Soon we are walking through a pretty pine forest in the mist. After a final small uphill we stand in front of the massive <a href="http://www.murowaniec.e-tatry.pl">Schronisko Murowaniec refuge</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15214246510" title="Schronisko Murowaniec by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3931/15214246510_1e268ebe57_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Schronisko Murowaniec" /></a></p>

<p>We head inside and it is full of people - some dressed in dry clothes, others looking just as wet &amp; miserable as we. Marcin shows me the drying wall, where I hang my wet gear after I slipped into my dry layers. Then it’s feasting time - I’m starving and munch away a soup and pancakes, a hot tea and coffee give more warmth. We sit for a while at the hut, with people coming and going. My clothes still moist but a bit drier I put them back on after almost two hours inside. Outside it’s still as misty as before, but the rain has become just the faintest drizzle. </p>

<p>Steadily we go down, soon the rain stops while the mist lingers on. We descend on paths that get broader and broader to a wide meadow. The mist mixes with the clouds and hangs above us while we walk towards Kuznice, a suburb of Zakopane and the start of a gondola up to Kasprowy Wierch.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15214316898" title="Down by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2947/15214316898_c764198aa9_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Down" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15214153899" title="Green under grey by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2946/15214153899_189ef3dfff_b.jpg" width="863" height="1024" alt="Green under grey" /></a></p>

<p>Here Marcin and I separate for a while - he needs to run an errand in town and hopes to catch a bus from here - we’ll meet up at the refuge later. After checking out the the small settlement with the gondola station and resisting buying some more food I hike up the broad cobblestone trail and take the first possibility into the forest.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15400906185" title="Cobblestone by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2945/15400906185_c9f9fbcb40_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Cobblestone" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15214397527" title="Fast by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2948/15214397527_125435355d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Fast" /></a></p>

<p>There’s several possibilities to visit shrines and monasteries along the trail, but I just want to reach the refuge to finally strip out of all the moist clothes, take a hot shower, dress in dry clothes and eat some good food. But the scenery is lovely on the way, and so I stop here and there to take photos.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15400582682" title="Tranquility by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3915/15400582682_cba7c400f9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Tranquility" /></a></p>

<p>As the forest disappears another wide meadow comes into view, with the pretty <a href="http://schroniska.pttk.pl/kondratowa/pl">Schronisko na Kondratowej Hali refuge</a> sitting at its side. I go in and am welcomed by smiling faces in the common room. While I don’t speak a word of Polish I still am able to communicate with the wonderful owners of the refuge and she shows me the room I am staying in. I put down my pack, get rid of the wet clothes and then just am for a moment. Then the rest of the evening is just as I imagined it would be: Hot shower, dry, warm clothes, good food, early to bed. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15214400107" title="Schronisko na Kondratowej Hali by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3872/15214400107_6ca4d4a074_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Schronisko na Kondratowej Hali" /></a></p>

<h2 id="ridges-and-summits">Ridges and Summits</h2>

<p>I slept great after the day before, and as we get up at 6 in the morning the sky is blue and the sun is already shining across the summits opposite my window. Marcin and I head silently down, where the two ladies of the refuge have a breakfast waiting for us! We eat, pack, and are out of the hut by 7 and make our way to the pass.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15214320388" title="Up to Giewont by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2946/15214320388_576117b4da_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Up to Giewont" /></a></p>

<p>The sky is blue with the occasional white cloud running across it and we quickly are hot from the sun and hiking. At the final spring we refill the <a href="http://www.bergzeit.co.uk/platypus/?pid=81">Platypus</a> bottles with cold, clear water and then walk on. Soon we are at the pass where we drop our packs into the shrubbery and almost run up to Giewont, so light we are!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15397733501" title="Further up to Giewont by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3866/15397733501_cb1086ff52_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Further up to Giewont" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15377897226" title="Final bit up to Giewont by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2945/15377897226_c0ec8a1c1d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Final bit up to Giewont" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15214268900" title="Summit of Giewont by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3848/15214268900_d99bdd983e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Summit of Giewont" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15400602172" title="Down from Giewont by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3853/15400602172_b9e263692a_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Down from Giewont" /></a></p>

<p>It doesn’t take us long and we’re standing on the summit, underneath the massive iron cross which can be seen from Zakopane. The views are hazy but good nevertheless: Zakopane towards the north with the small villages surrounding the city towards east &amp; west, and you even can glimpse into Slovakia from here. On the way down we encounter a lonely, old chamois and then soon are back at our packs. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15214337218" title="Ridge walk to Kondracka Kopa by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3877/15214337218_b8187c6356_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Ridge walk to Kondracka Kopa" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15377902416" title="A look down at the valley by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3888/15377902416_901ef59a4c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="A look down at the valley" /></a></p>

<p>The trail to Kondracka Kopa is a long, steady climb over a wide ridge. Clouds float over the ridge and surroundings summits, while alpine flowers are adding bright colours to the grey &amp; white of the sky. On my left I can see the lower hills of the Tatras and the meadow and refuge we slept in last night, and on the left zig-zags the trail down to the meadow from my original route. It does not take long and we’re on the summit of Kondracka Kopa, and now we will walk on the border of Poland and Slovakia while ticking off the next few summits.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15214340958" title="Along the border by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2949/15214340958_71b3d109f2_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Along the border" /></a></p>

<p>We stay now almost all the time above 2000 m elevation while we hike in the clouds from Kondracka Kopa to Malolaczniak, Krzesanica, Ciemniak and then Twarda Kopa. Once in a while the clouds rip open and we can see the lower Tatras in Slovakia, narrow valleys, high walls, streams running towards the far off sea. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15214423037" title="Towards Twarda Kopa by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3844/15214423037_2c456098d7_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Towards Twarda Kopa" /></a></p>

<p>From Twarda Kopa we can see Giemont in the distance, now in the clouds - but more worrisome is the helicopter which flies up to it from the valley. We don’t know what happened, but hope no one died.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15400937025" title="A look back to Giewont by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2943/15400937025_742b942b3e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="A look back to Giewont" /></a></p>

<p>Marcin waits for me at a large summit cairn and suggests we take the green trail down to the next refuge. It’s just around 11 and we have the whole day really in front of us still, so I agree and we take a turn from the big main path and walk on a very narrow path in a hanging meadow towards the Western Tatras.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15214191449" title="Down 2 by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3852/15214191449_334c07144a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="964" alt="Down 2" /></a></p>

<p>The views and the trail are spectacular. A narrow singletrack trail that’s demanding and exposed, but with gorgeous views on the lower-lying mountains, valleys, meadows - and in front of us, the Western Tatras. A pair of chamois give us a show as they are fighting in a couloir, but my view often just drifts to the horizon, where large mountains try to reach the sky with their summits. At a turn in the path we sit down and have a snack &amp; drink, while Marcin names the peaks and valleys and tells me anecdotes about geographical features. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15377924676" title="A look back up the green trail by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2941/15377924676_45d34c6126_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="A look back up the green trail" /></a></p>

<p>Too soon we reach the tree line, but the path continues to be lovely. It gradually widens and Marcin tells me that it has been an old road for an iron ore mine, and I again wonder about how much work it must have been to clear the forests to create it. While we talk we reach the meadow and a group of fully loaded foreign backpackers pass us, just as amazed about the beautiful scenery around them as we are. The trail now runs next to a stream, and it does not take long until we reach the <a href="http://www.schronisko-ornak.pl">Schronisko Ornak refuge</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15397759651" title="Schronisko Ornak by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2946/15397759651_65b41d3012_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Schronisko Ornak" /></a></p>

<p>It is busy outside and not even 13 o’clock. I check in with the help of Marcin and then accompany him down the valley - our hike ends here today, and I will be venturing on for the next two days on my own. The trail is now a wide dirt road and full of people, with plenty of trails going off on the right and left - trails which I will explore on my way back up to the refuge, I decide. And as Marcin tells me about the long caves up on the mountains which one can explore my afternoon suddenly looks like it will be filled with plenty of adventure!</p>

<p><em>To be continued.</em></p>

<p>So, you’ve landed in Helsinki and have some free time on your hands, which you’d like to spend outdoors. Good! There’s plenty of options available for you of where to go and what to do.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hugovk/7501133582/" title="Cycling with a bouldering mat by hugovk, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8281/7501133582_da6a8dc5d8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="575" alt="Cycling with a bouldering mat" /></a></p>

<p>If you’re into climbing and bouldering, then pick up the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/07/southern-finland-bouldering-guide.html">Southern Finland Bouldering Guide</a>
and visit <a href="http://27crags.com/">27 Crags</a> to view the locations in the Helsinki area. If you want to boulder, you won’t even need to leave the centre as there’s plenty of great problems within walking distance of the centre.</p>

<p>If you’re more the hiking/ backpacking/ trailrunning kind of type, then you might want to go and visit <a href="http://www.outdoors.fi/destinations/nationalparks/nuuksio/Pages/Default.aspx">Nuuksio</a> or <a href="http://www.outdoors.fi/destinations/nationalparks/sipoonkorpi/Pages/Default.aspx">Sipoonkorpi</a> National Park, which are within an hour driving distance and easily reached via public transportation. Then there’s the Trail 2000, a 110-km-long hiking trail, which begins in Laakso in Helsinki, and goes through the Nuuksio National Park. Just follow the blue bands on the trees =)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/11097111065/" title="Nuuksio by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5545/11097111065_c2ce1a242a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Nuuksio" /></a></p>

<p>Seakayaking &amp; packrafting is also possible as Helsinki is on a Peninsula and surrounded by the Baltic on three sides. If you prefer rivers, the Vantaajoki is the place to go, or ask one of the paddling &amp; packrafting guys from further up about good rivers! <a href="http://www.naturaviva.fi/en/">Natura Viva</a> rents kayaks and also has daily guided tours in the summer.</p>

<p>Cycling in Helsinki is fun. The cycling network is OK-ish (at least they try!) and <a href="http://www.bikemap.net/en/regional/Finland/Finland/Helsinki/">Bikemap</a> helps you to find different routes throughout the city. You also can use the <a href="http://pk.reittiopas.fi/en/">Journey Planner</a>, and check <a href="http://www.greenbike.fi/vuokrauskohteet_en.html">Greenbike’s Tips</a>, too. </p>

<h2 id="outdoors-indoors">Outdoors, Indoors</h2>

<p>Sometimes the weather is so bad that even the most hardened outdoor-types will gladly accept some shelter indoors. If you’re looking for outdoor related activities indoors, then <a href="http://www.haltia.com/">Haltia</a> is a good place to start. The new Finnish Nature Centre is next to Nuuksio National Park in a beautiful building, and enables you to experience nature from all over Finland in one building. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.luomus.fi/english/">Botanical Garden in Kaisaniemi</a> is not just in the summer a great place to go with its beautiful parks, also in winter it’s a fine destination. Right next to the railway station it has a few greenhouses with plants and trees from different climate zones which are well temperated and a real alternative to -20°C outside. If you prefer animals to plants visit the <a href="http://www.luomus.fi/english/nhm/">Natural History Museum</a> which is also smack-in-the-middle of the centre, or take a ferry to the <a href="http://www.korkeasaari.fi/en/services/visitorinformation">Korkeasaari Zoo</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/11097167264/" title="Kiipeilyareena Helsinki by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7434/11097167264_5c7ffd3ef1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Kiipeilyareena Helsinki" /></a></p>

<p>Climbers will visit the <a href="http://www.kiipeilyareena.com/">Kiipeily Areena</a> which has Scandinavia’s highest climbing wall and a sweet new boulder area. The <a href="http://www.boulderkeskus.com/fi/">Boulderkeskus</a> has two locations in the capital area and will present you with lots of fine problems.</p>

<p>In autumn there’s also a host of different events in the capital: The <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2012/09/banff-mountain-film-festival-world-tour-helsinki.html">Banff Mountain Film Festival</a>, the <a href="http://www.relaa.com/han">Helsinki Adventure Night</a> + Reel Rock Tour and the <a href="http://www.bicyclefilmfestival.com/city/helsinki/">Bicycle Film Festival</a> all have stops in the city and will wow you with sweet outdoor movies. The <a href="http://www.messukeskus.com/Sites1/Skiexpo/Sivut/default.aspx">Skiexpo</a> is a trade fair about, yes, skiing and winter sports, while the <a href="http://www.messukeskus.com/Sites3/GoExpo2014/Sivut/default.aspx">GoExpo</a> is a consumer fair for hikers, cyclists, fishermen, and other outdoor activities.</p>

<h2 id="outdoor-shops">Outdoor Shops</h2>

<p><a href="http://pelagobicycles.com/">Pelago Bicycles</a> is not just Finland’s best bike shop, they also make sweet bicycles - right in the middle of the city. If you’re just remotely interested in cycling, go visit their beautiful store. And yes, if you purchase a bike, they will pack it ready for air travel for you! </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/11098457723/" title="Pelago Bicycles by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5484/11098457723_f217251879_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Pelago Bicycles" /></a></p>

<p>In a city the size of Helsinki you find plenty of outdoor/ climbing/ trailrunning shops, which enable you to pick up the stuff you couldn’t bring or forgot. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.4runners.fi/">4 Runners</a> is in the <a href="http://www.kamppi.fi/">Kamppi</a> shopping mall and in my opinion the best running shop in Helsinki. They have a super collection of minimalist and barefoot running shoes (yes, also Inov-8s!) and accessories from GU Energy Gels to tights and toe socks. </p>

<p>Partio Varuste / <a href="http://www.scandinavianoutdoorstore.com/">Scandinavian Outdoor Store</a> are in the centre next to Kamppi and will satisfy gear needs of backpackers &amp; hikers. Pick up gas cartridges and alcohol fuel, try on Merrell shoes and get Woolpower underwear.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.camu.fi/">Camu</a> and <a href="http://www.mountainshop.fi/">Mountain Shop Finland</a> will be two shops which budding climbers &amp; mountaineers will put on their “Must visit” list. Here you can get the good fitting outdoor garments from Arc’teryx, Black Diamond, Rab as well as ice screws, quick-draws and whatever else a climber’s heart desires.</p>

<p>Finally, <a href="http://www.partioaitta.fi/">Partioaitta</a> is also in the centre (opposite of the Scandinavian Outdoor Store) and has also a few more shops in the capital area.</p>

<h2 id="sleeping-outdoors">Sleeping Outdoors</h2>

<p>Yes, you can sleep outdoors in Helsinki. There’s plenty of parks in the centre which are silent in the nights, and if you have a stealth shelter and rise early there shouldn’t be a problem with sleeping right in the middle of the capital. If you want to sleep outdoors but not in downtown, for 4.50€ a train and bus ride take you to Nuuksio, from where you can walk in 30 minutes to several different camping places. You also could take a bus or train to one of the more silent suburbs and camp there in a wood.</p>

<p>There’s some sweet <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/tell-a-friend?airef=w3kpza02eczz5">Airbnb</a> places available in downtown Helsinki if you do not want to camp out. There’s also a few reasonably priced hotels, though if you like it fancy, stay at the <a href="http://www.klauskhotel.com/">Klaus K</a> as they also have a good sustainable programme.</p>

<h2 id="food--cafs">Food &amp; Cafés</h2>

<p>The afore-mentioned Kamppi shopping mall has a couple of Cafés, and the <a href="http://www.johtocafe.com/in-english/">Johto Café</a> at the top has free Wifi. However, I prefer the <a href="http://mbar.fi/">mBar</a> in front of it - good coffees and friendly service, and a great terrace in the summer. If you find yourself hungry during lunch time, I find <a href="http://www.ravintolahalikarnas.fi/">Halikarnas</a> the best place to eat - delicious Turkish food with a wide vegetarian selection, this is a great place. <a href="http://www.grandelicato.fi/">Gran Delicato</a> is a Greek run Café which makes superb coffees and sandwiches, while there’s a host of Asian Buffet &amp; Restaurant places in the centre - just take your pick. If you like beer, stop by at <a href="http://www.teerenpeli.com/ravintolat/ravintolat/helsinki">Teerenpeli</a>, which, you guessed it, is also next to Kamppi.</p>

<p>If you rather cook yourself, the <a href="http://www.hok-elanto.fi/ostoksille/s-market/toimipaikat/s-market-sokos-helsinki/">S-Market</a> in front of the railway station probably has the lowest prices in the centre, but there’s plenty of <a href="http://www.alepa.fi/helsinki.html">Alepa</a> and <a href="http://www.siwa.fi/fi/kaupat-ja-aukioloajat/?nearestStore=&amp;nearestStore_id=&amp;city=Helsinki">Siwa</a> Supermarkets spread throughout the city, as well as the large (and expensive) <a href="http://www.k-market.com/Myymalat/K-market-Kamppi/">K-Market</a> in Kamppi. If you prefer organic, Fair Trade food, head over to <a href="http://www.ruohonjuuri.fi/myymalat/">Ruohonjuuri</a> which is also on the side of Kamppi.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/visitfinland/6992587550/" title="Mbar Terrace in  Helsinki by Visit Finland, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7236/6992587550_9f830d3ee1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="714" alt="Mbar Terrace in  Helsinki" /></a></p>

<h2 id="getting-around">Getting around</h2>

<p>Helsinki is a small city, and you easily can walk pretty much anywhere. It’s surrounded by the sea on three sides, and there’s several islands around this peninsula. If you want to speed up a bit, take the Tram, Metro, Bus or Commuter Train from <a href="http://www.hsl.fi/en">HSL</a>. For the Tram &amp; Metro you can send a Text Message to 16355 with “A1” as a message and you receive a digital ticket to your phone. In the bus and commuter train you can get a ticket from the driver/ conductor. If you prefer to pedal, loan a cycle from <a href="http://www.greenbike.fi/index_en.html">Greenbike</a> which has a stall in front of Kamppi. </p>

<p><em>That’s the Outdoor Guide to Helsinki. I hope it helps you to make your stay in the capital more outdoors-y and pleasant. If you have suggestions on how to improve it, please leave a comment!</em></p>

Time to ponder what is the best gift for hikers, armchair adventurers, climbers, and trail runners.</p>

<p><strong>The Best Gifts are No Gifts or Services.</strong> <em>Despite what follows, I strongly believe the best gift you can give your loved ones are non-tangible gifts, as in services and <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/guided-trips/">experiences</a>. Go for a hike or climb together (or let him/ her go for one!), maybe eat out or a give a nice Spa visit. Also arranging time off for your loved ones, so that they could pursue what they’d like to do, are great gifts. They’re better for the planet, too =)</em></p>

<h2 id="gifts-for-the-hiker">Gifts for The Hiker</h2>

<p>High on the list of any hiker are gifts from his favourite cottage. Here is whats definitely worth getting for your hiking friend:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can’t go wrong with a <a href="http://www.hyperlitemountaingear.com/hiking-climbing-shelters/mids.html">Hyperlite Mountain Gear Mid</a>. Light, spacious and easy to pitch, you also can find shelter under it when you head outdoors with your hiking buddy!</li>
  <li>Outside it is getting cold, so a warm <a href="http://www.trekking-lite-store.com/trekkingshop/Schlafsaecke/Quilts:::2_78.html?refID=hif">down quilt</a> from <a href="http://www.trekking-lite-store.com/trekkingshop/index.php?refID=hif">Trekking-Lite-Store.com</a> will ensure warm nights during winter camps.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.laufbursche-gear.de/">Laufbursche Gear</a> is coming out with four completely re-designed packs in 2014. There’s never such a thing as too many backpacks, so getting a brand new 2014 huckePACK is definitely something to wait for January 2014 and get!</li>
  <li>And as its cold and wet outside, a <a href="http://www.outdoorline.sk/en/32-synthetic-insulation">synthetic insulation garment</a> would work well also in the summer. Warms even when moist, synthetic is the way to go in wet &amp; cold environments.</li>
  <li>Finally, <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=ml&amp;ti=9933&amp;pw=73183">REI Gift Cards or e-Gift Cards</a> are a one-size-fits-all gift for your favourite outdoor enthusiast. Don’t trouble yourself picking up the wrong gift - just give a gift card!</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8544632349/" title="Anders leading a route by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8508/8544632349_56e6a0a150_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Anders leading a route" /></a></p>

<h2 id="gifts-for-the-climber">Gifts for The Climber</h2>

<p>Ah, the climber. Divided into many sub-species - the Boulderer, the Sports Climber, the Trad Climber, the Mountaineer or the Alpinist - you hopefully know which kind of climbing the receiver of your gift is practicing. Because a boulder doesn’t do much with a pair of crampons!</p>

<ul>
  <li>The ice climber will be giving you extra hugs and thanks for a pair of <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/04/petzl-nomic-ice-tools.html">Petzl Nomic ice tools</a>. </li>
  <li>Boulderers fall. That the fall is more soft, put a <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/07/ocun-paddy-dominator-crashpad.html">Ocún Paddy Dominator Crashpad</a> under the tree for them - large, light and functions as a mattress in a pinch, this is a superb crashpad to fall on when the holds are just too small to hold on to any longer.</li>
  <li>The Sport &amp; Trad Climber alike will welcome the gift of the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/10/dmm-classic-rope-bag.html">DMM Classic Rope Bag</a> for their ropes, be they single, twin or halfs. </li>
  <li>Alpinsts and Mountaineers need helmets for their adventures. At the moment there’s no lighter and fully certified helmet on the market than the <a href="http://bit.ly/1apnPXN">Sirocco Climbing Helmet</a>, and I can say out of <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/07/climbing-at-havukallio.html">experience</a> that it survives falls just great!</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.bergzeit.co.uk/scarpa/">Scarpa climbing shoes</a> will be a welcome gift for any climber. <a href="http://www.bergzeit.co.uk/scarpa-instinct-vc-climbing-shoe-silver-orange/">Instinct VCs</a> for the boulderers &amp; sports climbers, <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/04/scarpa-phantom-ultra-boots.html">Scarpa Phantom Ultra Boots</a> for the alpinists, ice climbers and mountaineers, Scarpa makes great shoes for all!</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/garryknight/8560855544/" title="Mounted Police on a City Street by garryknight, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8392/8560855544_eb1a0bc3df_b.jpg" width="1024" height="678" alt="Mounted Police on a City Street" /></a></p>

<h2 id="gifts-for-the-urban-hiker">Gifts for The Urban Hiker</h2>

<p>The urban hiker, also called Armchair Adventurer, would like to spend more time in the wild but finding enough time between family, work and other commitments proves difficult. You could make sure he has a free weekend for some hiking/ climbing/ packrafting/ cycling, and maybe consider one of these items for the everyday outdoor adventure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is there a backpack which can do everything? Yes, it’s the <a href="http://www.goruck.com/en/gr1">GORUCK GR1</a>. Wear it to work, go climbing, travel for a week and then head out backpacking, cycling to work. The GR1 does it all, and will last you a lifetime. </li>
  <li><a href="http://us.shop.ecco.com/men-outdoor/men-outdoor,default,sc.html#sz=60">ECCO shoes</a> look the deal and will perform on the way to the office and for the after-work hike to the scenic lookout.</li>
  <li>Trousers. Some call them pants. Whatever you call them, with a pair from <a href="http://shop.outlier.cc/retail/pants/">Outlier</a> you will sport a functional pair that looks great in the city and takes you everywhere your bike and feet can take you, keeping you dry and warm in nasty weather.</li>
  <li>Again a late day at the office? A fine <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/books/">outdoor book</a> is just what’s needed then. Sit down at home, take a dram and skim through one of these fine books to let at least the mind escape the urban environment. A good option is also a <a href="http://www.trekkingmagazin.com/abonnement">subscription to trekking Magazin</a>.</li>
  <li>Also in an urban environment it is useful to know the time. And the barometric pressure. And where is north. That’s why a <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/10/garmin-fenix.html">Garmin fēnix</a> might be an useful gift for those that easily get lost in the city, and need to find their way back.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/akunamatata/2821684589/" title="UTMB 2008 (160) by akunamatata, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3291/2821684589_0fbf842eeb_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="UTMB 2008 (160)" /></a></p>

<h2 id="gifts-for-the-trailrunner">Gifts for The Trailrunner</h2>

<p>The trailrunner is the kind of person who will head out in pretty much any weather. Snow? Extra fun! Rain? Where’s that hardshell? Cold feet? Run faster! </p>

<ul>
  <li>You can not go wrong with a Vest from <a href="http://bit.ly/17Iug9J">Ultimate Direction</a>. Hands-down the best running vests, your trailrunning mate will run in happy circles around you!</li>
  <li>A second pair of his favourite <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/trailrunningschuhe/fuer--maenner/">trailrunning shoes</a>. Chances are his first pair are at the end of the life already, so why not get her/ him a new pair?!</li>
  <li>Chances are your trailrunning gift receiver also is just now outside running, despite the weather being close to 0°C and it’s rainy. Time to get some sweet <a href="http://www.theomm.com/products/clothing/">The OMM</a> garments which will keep him/ her warm in this fresh weather!</li>
  <li><a href="https://guenergy.com/">GU Energy</a> makes top notch gels, and getting a mix of these will be the best running nutrition stuff you can get to keep him running.</li>
  <li><a href="http://bit.ly/1bAKKwa">Running glasses</a> create shade and keep wind, dirt and rain from the eyes, so that they can stay focussed on the trail ahead. Being able to change lenses is a big advantage - the light is different in the snow than in the desert!</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hades2k/6598576457/" title="Christmas presents by Hades2k, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7029/6598576457_8234fc4768_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Christmas presents" /></a></p>

<p><em>Pssst! All of the above not good enough? May I then recommend getting a <a href="https://www.alpackaraft.com/index.cfm/store.catalog/Packrafts">packraft</a> &amp; <a href="http://surlybikes.com/bikes/moonlander">Fatbike</a>? You sure may get me one ;) !</em></p>
