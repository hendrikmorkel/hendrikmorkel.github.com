<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>I received the Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX over a year ago in November 2013. I climbed ice in Korouoma, Vaasa and <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/abisko-ice-climbing-festival-2014.html">Abisko</a> with them and was mountaineering in <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/07/arcteryx-alpine-academy-2014.html">Chamonix</a> and the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/mountaineering-and-climbing-in-the-polish-tatras.html">Polish Tatras</a>. All in all they have seen over four weeks of use and have been used for ice climbing, mountaineering and hiking.</p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>Again Ueli Steck has helped to develop this boot, and you can see it from the weight and the technical features. While the sock-gaiter-construction isn’t new I have not seen a lot of mountaineering boots which use it. The Y-Structure, KCN-Tech fabric and Re-Active AC XT sole stand out on this booth, as does the very good fit &amp; the light weight.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15889704852" title="Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7473/15889704852_aecafa05ca_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX" /></a></p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>The shoe is hand made in Italy and is from a quality point of view absolutely superb. The fit is impeccable and even after four weeks of hard use the boots still look like new. Only the reflective tape in the back of the shoe shoes some wear, otherwise boot and sole still look like new.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14417800278" title="Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5078/14417800278_0203ed722c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX" /></a></p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>773 g per boot in Size 42,5 or 1.546 g for the pair. </p>

<h2 id="sustainability--recyclability">Sustainability &amp; Recyclability</h2>

<p>The boots are hand made in Italy. If you have worn it out you could have it resoled at your local shoemaker or you can recycle it via your local recycling scheme.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15270675413" title="Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX - Back by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7567/15270675413_b4b29d5fe3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX - Back" /></a></p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p><strong>Ice &amp; Mixed climbing</strong> I did with the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/04/grivel-g20-crampons.html">Grivel G20 crampons</a> to the boot and it’s a fantastic combination. The G20 are 424 g per crampon which means one shoe &amp; boot are 1197 g, which is about 150 g lighter than with the Phantom Ultra boots on. This might seem trivial but feels like a big difference. What I enjoy most with the Rebel Ultra GTX is, however, the freedom of movement my feet have in them. I can pretty much fully move my feet like I could in a trailrunner, with the difference that I can connect a pair of crampons to them and climb ice with them. This is especially useful for mixed climbing, but also on more tricky ice climbs in narrow places this freedom of movement helps in better foot placements. The high sock works like a gaiter &amp; keeps water and snow out and the carbon insert makes the sole nicely rigid for climbing. In short, the climbing in them is great, I really loved the freedom of movement they gave me. </p>

<p>The last winter was super mild and I wasn’t able to test the boots in severe cold weather, but the -5°C I used them in, often while standing around on snow and ice, where no problem for them and I had warm feet and toes in the boots. When constantly moving one might be able to wear them in even colder temperatures, say to -10°C, but beyond that I reckon they will be not warm enough and it’s better to put a warmer boot on. One option that I haven’t tried is using an overboot with them in colder weather for a little bit of extra insulation, though I almost think that just using a warmer boot would be lighter - though less versatile.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15864534166" title="Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX in Chamonix by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7496/15864534166_7c1da26c08_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX in Chamonix" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Hiking</strong> in these boots is possible but really wasn’t something I liked. While they allow great freedom of movement they are lined boots, so walking from the Chalet to the Cable Car in Chamonix, a 15 minutes walk, was not enjoyable as it was +35°C in the valley, which meant I had super-sweaty feet by the time I arrived at the house. In the Tatras I hiked on two occasions with the Rebel Ultra GTX boots, once in warm weather which again was not good, and once in the pouring rain, where they were fine. I had moist feet &amp; boots after hiking four hours in the rain in them, but they were warm so it was OK. They did also dry almost completely over night. However, when I know I need to hike long distances in the summer I would always take my <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/luna-sandals-oso.html">Luna Sandals OSO</a> along for it, as I much prefer to hike in warm weather in them.</p>

<p><strong>Mountaineering</strong> in the Alps and Tatras I did most of the time with the <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/grivel-air-tech-new-matic-steigeisen/?pid=81">Grivel Air Tech New-Matic</a> (453 g per crampon) but I also tried the <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/camp-xlc-390-steigeisen/">CAMP XLC 390</a> (254 g incl. optional Antibot). The weight difference between these two crampons is almost 200 g so not trivial. I did climb more with the Grivel Air Tech New-Matics and do like them a lot, and these two crampons show that you can use the Rebel Ultra with either a plastic harness or a front bale. The light weight and freedom of movement of the boot of course are great for alpine climbs and the sole is sticky on rock and allows for precise foot placements. I still would switch to <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/06/scarpa-stix.html">climbing shoes</a> for more demanding/ technical climbs, but if it are easy routes you’re doing the Rebel Ultra GTX are more than capable. Add in good grip on snow &amp; ice and you have a very efficient mountaineering boot.</p>

<h2 id="competing-products">Competing Products</h2>

<p>The <a href="">Scarpa Phantom Ultra</a> is a warmer and heavier boot which might attract the same people who’re curious about the Rebel Ultra GTX. If we look at other brands the <a href="http://bit.ly/1xAiXwT">La Sportiva Trango Cube GTX</a> and the <a href="http://bit.ly/1AhNGww">La Sportiva Batura 2.0 GTX</a> are both lightweight mountaineering boots which can be used for the same activities as the Rebel Ultra GTX.</p>

<h2 id="could-be-better">Could be better</h2>

<p>I’m hard-pressed to come up with something that could be better in this boot. I am sure Scarpa and Ueli had their reasons to use Gore-Tex® instead of OutDry® for this shoe, personally I feel OutDry® is slightly better at keeping moisture out, dries faster and breathes better, but I think the Gore-Tex® lining does a good job in this boot. So really nothing to complain.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15890337425" title="Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX with Grivel G20 Crampons attached by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7497/15890337425_9735b0f75f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX with Grivel G20 Crampons attached" /></a></p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>The Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX is a beautiful <em>and</em> ultralight mountaineering boot that is excellent for early and late season ice &amp; mixed climbing and summer mountaineering. It keeps your feet &amp; toes warm till at least -5°C even if you’re just standing around in the snow or hang in the belay, and with the Vibram® sole it is also well suited for easy alpine climbs. I think if you look to up your ice, mixed and alpine climbing by shedding weight and going lighter the Rebel Ultra GTX is the right boot for you. I love my pair and am always happy to put them on, because I know a good day in the outdoors lies ahead of me with them on my feet.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ladies, are you looking for a pair of warm winter boots that look good in the city and on day hikes? Then hear what my wife has to say about the <a href="https://www.panamajackshop.com/woman/footwear/bambina-igloo-b2">Panama Jack Bambina Igloo Boots</a>!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/13264850834/" title="Panama Jack Bambina Igloo Boots by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3737/13264850834_79ba73db5c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Panama Jack Bambina Igloo Boots" /></a></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Winter here in Finland is almost over now, and I decided to take my <a href="https://www.panamajackshop.com/woman/footwear/bambina-igloo-b2">Panama Jack Bambina Igloo Boots</a> for their last stroll in the nature before packing them up for the next winters to come. I believe we will be having many good years together - after all, the first Panama Jacks I bought in Spain 5 years ago are still as good as new.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/13264494815/" title="Panama Jack Bambina Igloo Boots by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2834/13264494815_434228a938_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Panama Jack Bambina Igloo Boots" /></a></p>

<p>These Spaniards are born to cold climates, icy roads and cold breezes. This winter was particularly short, but we had the chance to experience up to - 20 degrees together. My feet were perfectly warm, assuming that I was mostly on the move while being outside and I wore thin, wool socks. Special thanks to the rubber outsoles that kept me on my feet also when walking on plain ice - where other boots’ sole behave like ice skates, these had a solid grip.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/13264494165/" title="Panama Jack Bambina Igloo Boots by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7128/13264494165_d48c69ea4f_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Panama Jack Bambina Igloo Boots" /></a></p>

<p>The leather in both pairs of Panama Jack shoes I have is especially hard wearing, and the shoes are durable and carefully crafted. They’re also extremely comfortable to wear, and look good in the city and on day hikes alike. I am looking forward to seeing this pair again in November 2014!</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>
<p>I have used the Scarpa Phantom Ultra boots for seven full days of ice climbing and a couple of days of walking. This review thus should be considered as an initial review, which I will update during the next winter season when I have got more use with them. </p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>
<p>The function of these boots is manyfold:</p>

<ul>
  <li>keep your feet warm and dry in cold temperatures and wet conditions</li>
  <li>crampon compatible</li>
  <li>comfortable to walk in on long approaches</li>
  <li>rigid sole for climbing</li>
</ul>

<p>So how does the Phantom Ultra do these things? </p>

<ul>
  <li>Dry: Thanks to OutDry’s windproof and waterproof breathable membrane the boots stay dry in wet conditions, while letting your feet’s sweat escape. Don’t expect wonders, though: After a day of climbing the boot will be moist on the inside.</li>
  <li>Warm: They are warm, warmer than any other shoe or boot I have worn in winter, even after a long day outdoors. They are not as warm as double boots like the <a href="http://en.scarpa.net/products/high-altitude/phantom-guide/">Phantom Guide</a> or <a href="http://en.scarpa.net/products/high-altitude/phantom-6000/">Phantom 6000</a>, but for my needs they offer plenty of warmth. If you get very easily cold feet then one of the aforementioned Phantoms might be a better choice, though for me they offer plenty of warmth when out on a -15°C day climbing on frozen waterfalls.</li>
  <li>Crampon compatible: Sure thing, or did you think I climb ice without crampons?!</li>
  <li>Comfortable: As you know, I’m a trailrunner kind-of-guy. I wear them each day on all occasions, so getting into a boot was a new thing. Well, the Phantom Ultras were hailed as very comfortable boots in reviews, and I will join in that song. They are very comfortable. After I got used to walk in boots it was nice to put them on each morning and walk to the ice falls, and even on longer approaches they didn’t harm my feet. So far there have been no blisters or other foot problems, and just a very good, comfortable feeling.</li>
  <li>Stiff sole: The sole on the Phantom Ultra is a Pentax Speed sole, which is considered soft in the midsole. I haven’t been able to feel that, as a soft sole is for me something like the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2012/07/inov-8-x-talon-190.html">X-Talon 190</a> and the Phantom Ultra are for me rigid. As I have only used the Ultras I obviously can’t compare them to other technical mountaineering boots. Keep in mind though that I have quite small boots (Size 42.5) which are inherently more rigid than larger sized models, where this soft midsole could be easier felt.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8648505633/" title="Scarpa Phantom Ultra &amp; Grivel G20 by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8263/8648505633_bddd40045b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Scarpa Phantom Ultra &amp; Grivel G20" /></a></p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>Some of the features you already read about above, other things which I really liked:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The laces are great: Easy to knot and open, just the right length and a great match for this boot</li>
  <li>Integrated gaiter means no need for an extra gaiter to keep snow out of your boots</li>
  <li>A Vibram Sole which won’t let you slip on wet rocks</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8648587539/" title="Scarpa Phantom Ultra &amp; Grivel G20 by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8399/8648587539_d85e1735a7_b.jpg" width="680" height="1024" alt="Scarpa Phantom Ultra &amp; Grivel G20" /></a></p>

<h2 id="fit">Fit</h2>
<p>My pair is a Size 42.5 and they fit very well. I took them a half number bigger so that I’m not hitting my toes against the inside of the shoe when kicking the crampons in the ice, and that works well.</p>

<p>The boots fit me perfectly. Out of the box. There was no long, painful walks required to make them comfortable and fitting my feet, they just were perfect from the start. Plenty of room for the toes, even in thick socks, a tight fit in the heel, comfortable around the ankle and lower leg, a little bit of flex when walking, rigid enough for climbing. </p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>
<p>Ueli Steck helped develop this boot, and on his recommendation Scarpa partnered with OutDry which provides the WPB membrane for the boot. I feel that OutDry dries faster than Gore Tex in shoes, at least my shoes where, when overnight indoors, dry again the next morning. </p>

<p>Of course the weight of these boots is one of the biggest innovations, there were, as these boots came out, not many comparable boots which were as light and warm. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8649675898/" title="Scarpa Phantom Ultra &amp; Grivel G20 by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8253/8649675898_704ce60888_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Scarpa Phantom Ultra &amp; Grivel G20" /></a></p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>
<p>These boots are 100% Made in Italy, and if you know a thing or two about shoes then you likely are aware that the Italians are great craftsman which can make superb shoes and boots. This pair is no different, and the Phantom Ultras are impeccably made. From a smooth outer which is waterproof and which offers no place for stones, snow, dirt and dust to enter or a crampon to snatch a lace to a comfortable inner these boots are exceptionally well made. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8649657680/" title="Scarpa Phantom Ultra &amp; Grivel G20 by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8404/8649657680_450088aa26_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Scarpa Phantom Ultra &amp; Grivel G20" /></a></p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>
<p>My Phantom Ultras are 1845 gram for the pair or 918 g per shoe, Size 42,5. That’s slightly over the claimed weight of 850 gram per boot but still acceptable for me. The new La Sportiva Batura 2.0 is lighter, as are the new <a href="http://en.scarpa.net/products/tech-mountain/rebel-ultra-gtx/">Scarpa Rebel GTX</a>.</p>

<p>I expect these boots to hold very long. Probably the zipper or the gaiter will be the first ones to go broken, but the sole and boot itself make a very durable impression on me. And even when the sole will wear down, you can get them resoled.</p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>
<p>Before I decided to get the Phantom Ultra I did quite a bit of research. Dane from <a href="http://coldthistle.blogspot.com">Cold Thistle</a>, <a href="http://www.relaa.com/">Artturi</a>, <a href="http://lightfromthenorth.blogspot.com">Toby</a>, <a href="http://www.valppaus.com/">Joni</a> and <a href="http://www.nicktruax.com/">Nick</a> all have helped me to make the decision. Especially Nick and Dane who also both use the Phantom Ultras have been answering my questions about warmth and sizes - again many thanks for that.</p>

<p>Once the boots were here I decided to go for a walk in them. It’s surprising how different boots feel after years of using only trailrunners and slip-ons. I got used to it pretty quickly though, and appreciated how warm they were. On their <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/02/climbing-ice.html">first outing</a> we had a short walk-in in deep snow, and walking wasn’t a problem by now anymore. Climbing then.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8495038643/" title="Going up by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8086/8495038643_9fc37b4a8f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Going up" /></a></p>

<p>After I put on my crampons, a first for me, I walked up to the ice and started my first ice climb. It wasn’t that cold that day, and my skills were at the beginning, but what they were supposed to do they did: I had warm feet, happily kicked my crampons in the ice and didn’t hit my toes. In <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/03/abisko-ice-climbing-festival-2013-experiences.html">Abisko</a> then the walk-ins were equally short, but in <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/03/ice-climbing-in-korouoma.html">Korouoma</a> we were hiking for up to 45 minutes from the camp (and the hike out back to the car was a strenuous 30 minutes uphill hike!). In these situations the boots performed great too, the secret is to not lace them up to tight - that way the walking is more comfortable. But also because they have a bit of flex they’re good to walk in.</p>

<p>Once I broke through the ice underneath a fall and stood till my knee in ice cold water, but thanks to the integrated gaiter only a tiny bit came inside. But even after this accident I didn’t get cold feet at temperatures of around -10°C, standing on ice at the bottom of a fall belaying my partner leading up a route, which was evidence for their warmth for me.</p>

<p>In Korouoma I also slept outside, and after a full day of climbing the boots were slightly moist from sweat. In the hut I was able to dry them a bit by the stove, but they were next to me in my shelter during the night. As I woke up in the morning it was -15°C and getting in the frozen boots was difficult, but once inside and walking they quickly got warm again, and there were no problems with cold toes/ feet.</p>

<p>Overall I rate them very high: Comfortable to walk in on approaches, rigid soles for climbing, warm when standing on ice and belaying, and keeping my feet dry from the water you’re bound to encounter when ice climbing.</p>

<h2 id="competing-products">Competing Products</h2>
<p>A whole lot, but only a handful in the same weight category: the <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/la-sportiva-batura-2-0-gtx-schuhe-black-yellow.html">La Sportiva Batura 2.0 GTX</a> is claimed 1800 gram for the pair. It’s the lightest alternative I’m aware of, although the <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/mammut-nordwand-tl-bergstiefel/">Mammut Nordwand TL</a> is only a few dozen of gram heavier with a claimed weight of 1888 gram. The new <a href="http://en.scarpa.net/products/tech-mountain/rebel-ultra-gtx/">Scarpa Rebel GTX</a> are lighter too, but have no integrated gaiters. If you know other lightweight boots please leave a comment (incl. weight if possible!) and I’ll add them here.</p>

<p>Dane from <a href="http://coldthistle.blogspot.com/2010/09/scarpa-phantom-ultra.html">Cold Thistle</a> rates the Phantom Ultras very high, as does <a href="http://www.nicktruax.com/">Nick</a>.</p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>
<p>I’m very happy with the <a href="http://en.scarpa.net/products/high-altitude/phantom-ultra/">Scarpa Phantom Ultra</a> boots and can recommend them for anyone who is looking for a lightweight boot for ice &amp; mixed climbing and winter mountaineering. They’re warm enough reasonably cold conditions (about -20°C I’d say), keep your feet dry and are comfortable to walk in. They’re great for climbing both ice and mixed, easy to put on and also look very good in my opinion. And after all: Boots that are used by <a href="http://www.uelisteck.ch/en.html">Ueli Steck</a> just can’t be bad =)</p>
