    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Three times a charm, they say. My love affair with Åland went into the third round last week as I was photographing a story for the <a href="http://www.norrmagazin.de">NORR</a> and <a href="http://www.partioaitta.fi/365klubi/365-lehti">365 Magazine</a> about cycling, bouldering and sea kayaking on the beautiful Åland Archipelago between Finland and Sweden. </p>

<p><a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/02/aland-in-winter.html">The last time I was on Åland</a> was just in January, and how different it was back then: The roads under snow and ice, the Baltic partially frozen, a cold wind blowing. But it was also similar to the previous <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/11/bouldering-on-aland.html">bouldering trip to Åland</a> and this visit: The people were fantastic and made the trip even more memorable. Which made me realize once more: It’s more beautiful to share an outdoor adventure with friends. Sure it is nice to watch the sun set over the sea, but it is more fun to share that moment with a good friend. It’s cool if you topped out on your route, but it’s cooler if you have a friend to high-five with to celebrate that success. And while Sauna is always great, also on your own, it’s much better with friends who share your passion for a good <em>löyly</em>. So when you head out on your next outdoor adventure, take someone along: Your partner, kids, mate or someone who shares the same love for the outdoors than you do. I’m certain the trip will be more fun &amp; memorable for both of you =) </p>

<p>So much for advice, here’s a couple of B-Roll photos and one-liners to wet your appetite to head over to Åland with a bike and Crashpad on your back.</p>

<p>Kathrin from <a href="http://luminoucity.net">Luminoucity</a>, Kristof and me rolling onto the ferry by bike. My first time to roll on a bike onto a ferry, and a good one. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28810987461/in/album-72157672041470976/" title="Good Bye Helsinki"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8424/28810987461_9fe00bcb5c_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1200" alt="Good Bye Helsinki" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We said Good-By to Helsinki on the sun deck, sans sun.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28269451094/in/album-72157672041470976/" title="Morning cycling through along the fields"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7783/28269451094_8364170fbc_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Morning cycling through along the fields" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>At dawn we arrived on Åland and started to cycle up north to <a href="http://www.havsvidden.com">HavsVidden</a> past golden fields and a rising sun. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28810986491/in/album-72157672041470976/" title="Kristof at Kasviken"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7730/28810986491_0b29a9ae18_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1069" alt="Kristof at Kasviken" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We slipped in a session at Kasviken as it was so conveniently on the way. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28810986241/in/album-72157672041470976/" title="Relaxing at HavsVidden"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8846/28810986241_95f636f677_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1069" alt="Relaxing at HavsVidden" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>After that it was pretty chill at the beach house. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="http://amzn.to/2beNxGI" title="The Best We Can Do Is Nothing"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8160/28798090366_542e2ab604_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1069" alt="The Best We Can Do Is Nothing" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I read an <a href="http://amzn.to/2beNxGI">inspiring book</a> the next morning, which motivated me to do… nothing.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28798090286/in/album-72157672041470976/" title="Relaxing at Fågelberget"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8269/28798090286_a9f93a9c13_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1200" alt="Relaxing at Fågelberget" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>In between bouts of work I succeeded in following the books advice.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28855542636/in/album-72157672041470976/" title="Stallhagen Beers are tasty!"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8646/28855542636_ea16422b1f_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Stallhagen Beers are tasty!" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Then I failed pretty badly by cycling close to 46 km to go eat at <a href="http://www.stallhagen.com/en/?ageok=yes">Stallhagen</a>, and yes, drink some of their fantastic beers. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28855541356/in/album-72157672041470976/" title="Pelago Bicycles Capri"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8895/28855541356_f75340ee58_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Pelago Bicycles Capri" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>My friends were very happy with their <a href="https://www.pelagobicycles.com">Pelago Bicycles</a>, here the pretty <a href="https://www.pelagobicycles.com/bicycles/capri.html">Capri</a> which Vera rode.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28810989711/in/album-72157672041470976/" title="Portrait Sessions"><img src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8776/28810989711_fe8e83bd40_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Portrait Sessions" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I myself had my much loved <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/11/pelago-bicycles-stavanger.html">Stavanger</a> along, which performed flawlessly once again. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28810989151/in/album-72157672041470976/" title="On the way back to Mariehamn from Kobba Klintar"><img src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8695/28810989151_1951188c9e_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1200" alt="On the way back to Mariehamn from Kobba Klintar" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Jonas from <a href="http://www.paddelboden.com">The Paddle Shack</a> took us out to Kobba Klintar, the old pilot station which is really a great destination for a day of paddling. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28798090336/in/album-72157672041470976/" title="Seakayaking with Paddelboden"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8895/28798090336_ebc0d4057a_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1069" alt="Seakayaking with Paddelboden" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>On the way back we had back wind and choppy seas, so it was nice when we weaved back into the Archipelago and let ourselves just drift in the wind back towards the shack. Then it was just about cycling back to the ferry harbour and waiting for our big boat back to Helsinki. It was once again a fantastic visit and I can highly recommend you to spend a week or more on Åland if you’re into any of the above activities. And I’ll let you know where to read the good story and see the proper photos when it’s out!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My last visit to <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/11/bouldering-on-aland.html">Åland</a> took me there in the golden autumn when I went bouldering &amp; exploring the island and it’s beautiful forests, bays and islands. This year I returned to Åland in the depth of winter to go skiing, drink beer at the Stallhagen Microbrewery and meet the Krokodil Dundee of Ahvenanmaa as part of the <a href="http://www.nbe.fi">Nordic Blogger Experience</a>.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24497045390/in/dateposted/" title="Åland &lt;3"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1589/24497045390_843de23e41_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Åland &lt;3" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The last time on Åland I was host to my bouldering friends from Germany, a role I would take on yet again this time around - but happily I had the help of Henriikka of <a href="http://aamukahvilla.fi">Aamukahvilla</a> fame who would with me together host eight fellow bloggers: Alizé and Max of <a href="http://detourlocal.com">Detour Local</a>, Alice and Alessandro from <a href="http://www.agipsyinthekitchen.com">A Gipsy in the Kitchen</a>, Aleksandra from <a href="http://duze-podroze.pl">Duże Podróże</a>, Sara aka <a href="http://www.thisgirlloves.co.uk">This Girl Loves</a>, Lee who writes for <a href="http://ab-road.co.kr">Ab-Road</a> and <a href="http://blog.naver.com/s1h25s">Hyesun</a>. Together we were ten bloggers from eight countries, with one thing in common: The love for travelling. And travelling we would on this trip.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24424588929/in/dateposted/" title="Cabin Life"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1670/24424588929_69afe991b8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Cabin Life" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Meeting up with each other in Helsinki to catch the ferry to Mariehamn proved to be no problem, and together we boarded the <a href="http://www.vikingline.fi/?gclid=CNi5s9nY28oCFQsEwwodZrsEfw">Viking Line</a> ferry. After throwing our luggage into our cabins we proceeded to the Viking Buffet, a time-limited all-you-can-eat-and-drink feast. We had the company of a group of fellow NBE Bloggers who were setting over to Stockholm and so after we filled our bellies with salmon, salad and desserts we went on to show our foreign friends what the ferry experience all includes. Or we would have, if we wouldn’t have to get up at 4:00 o’clock to get off the boat in Mariehamn! Two Taxis whisked us to <a href="http://www.alandhotels.fi/en/hotel-pommern">Hotel Pommern</a> and after a few more hours of sleep it was time for our first day on Åland and exploring it with its winter gown on.</p>

<p>Like the rest of Finland also Åland had gotten a great layer of snow, and so we went to cross-country ski in Jomala. A freshly groomed track lead around the soccer field, but after a few circles around the field we became more adventurous and headed out on the 2 km long loipe through the forest. Small hills made for fun rides down, and the forest in its white snow cover was a much better representation of what cross-country skiing is all about: Experiencing the forest on skis with only a light breeze in the tree tops and the song of birds. Sadly our schedule already called for the next activity, so we skied back to the sports hall, put on our shoes and then went on to the Café Uffe på Berget Watchtower - a tower I already wanted to climb on my last visit. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24792276975/in/dateposted/" title="All along the watchtower"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1511/24792276975_584aba0a05_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="All along the watchtower" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>On the top a cold breeze and wide views welcomed us, and after a few photos we headed onwards to Kastelholm Castle. Sadly it was closed so we only were able to admire it from the outside, but if you like castles then this should definitely be on your list when visiting Åland (but then in summer, when it is open!). All this skiing &amp; sight-seeing made us hungry so a visit to <a href="http://www.dinosbar.com">Dinos Bar &amp; Grill</a> was in order. Tasty burgers and local beers put the energy levels high again, high enough to meet the local newspapers which wanted to interview some of us at the Ålands Sjöfarts Museum. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://sjofartsmuseum.ax/">Ålands Sjöfarts Museum</a> is a Museum worth a visit, even if you’re not a sea-faring captain who has sailed on all seven seas. It’s a touch &amp; try Museum, and you can climb the rigging inside, enter the original, reconstructed Captain’s quarters and learn about sea-faring back in the day. It is also home to one of only two original Pirate flags in the world, <em>YARR!</em> - and in the cellar there are three more exhibitions which will be interesting for small and big sailors alike.</p>

<p>After such a full programme there where two essential things left to do today: Relax in the sauna at the <a href="http://www.mariehamn.ax/idrott-fritid/idrottsanlaggningar/mariebad/">Badhuset Mariebad</a> and then have a tasty Dinner at the <a href="http://www.stallhagen.com/en/">Stallhagen Brewery</a>. After all the cold activities outside it was wonderful to relax in a warm sauna, chat with the new friends and go for a swim in the pool. Sadly Sauna time always goes over way too fast, but as we were hungry and the Chefs at Stallhagen were cooking tasty food for us, it wasn’t too difficult to leave. Plus, the Stallhagen beers are pretty good and if you’re a beer enthusiast then you’ll want to plan in a visit at this fine establishment.</p>

<h2 id="to-the-outer-reaches-a-visit-to-jurmo">To the Outer Reaches: A visit to Jurmo</h2>

<p>Monday morning started early as we travelled to Jurmo, Brändö, an island which is a mere 30 minutes by ferry from Kustavi on Mainland Finland - bu a nearly five our oneway trip from Mariehamn. Taxi, ferry, Taxi, ferry, and a Quad-Taxi would bring us far, far away from the capital of the Åland islands. </p>

<p>On Jurmo live around 25 people, and its a place where you can see what happens when old people die and young people move to the city: There’s silence. Closed window shutters. No traffic. You make the first tracks out in the forest and on the ice. A place where neighbours know, and help each other.</p>

<p>Our guide on the small island of Jurmo was <a href="http://www.brando.ax/fi/turisti-info/aktiviteetit">Kaj Lundberg</a>, who works as a fishing guide in summer and welcomed us to his house. We told us about the story of the island while we drunk hot coffee and ate Pulla, and then it was time to see more of Jurmo. We ten bloggers sat on a small trailer which Kaj pulled with his Quad, and so we went and climbed the Watchtower, took a stroll on the frozen Baltic and had fun with the snow, before we returned for a tasty dinner of local fish and potatoes. Way too soon we needed to head back to the first of many ferry and Taxi rides which would bring us back to Mariehamn, where we would just have enough time to pack, eat supper and then head for the ferry back to Helsinki, where on the next day the <a href="http://www.nbe.fi">Nordic Blogger Experience</a>, the <a href="http://www.messukeskus.com/">MATKA fair</a> and many more bloggers would wait for a few exciting days - which you’ll read about soon!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In September I was lucky enough to visit Åland, the magical island that’s right in the middle between two of the best countries on this planet. It’s well-known for many things: Fine cycling and sea-kayaking, a rich history, pleasant weather, friendly people, tasty apples and superb bouldering. The third week of our climbing road trip through Finland we directed our trusty touring van towards Turku, drove on a ferry and enjoyed the journey to Åland, the promised island of Nordic bouldering.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15876015612" title="Christoph on Game Over, 7c by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7483/15876015612_7334e07262_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Christoph on Game Over, 7c" /></a></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Once we arrived in Mariehamn, the capital of Åland, we made a stop at the office of <a href="http://www.visitaland.com">Visit Åland</a> to pick up maps and have a chat with our hosts. Then it was off to the calm pedestrian main street with nice shops and Cafés. People were sitting outside on terraces and as we were eating a sandwich we too shed layers until we sat there in our T-Shirts. This final leg of our journey started off well, with great weather and a gorgeous place to stay, the <a href="http://www.visitaland.com/en/services/dano-strandvillor/">Dånö Strandvillor</a> in Geta, almost at the other end of the island.</p>

<p>We drove there full of anticipation, and as we arrived at the beautiful beach villa it was even better than expected! Comfortable beds, great views, a sauna, a large kitchen and living room and even Wifi! We quickly went down to the beach to check out the sea, take a quick paddle and relax. In the evening the sauna was heated up, as it would be every evening, and we made a game plan on which sectors to visit when. </p>

<p>What follows is an introduction to the different sectors with links to their <a href="https://27crags.com">27 Crags</a> pages, though I highly recommend you to pick up the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/07/southern-finland-bouldering-guide.html">Southern Finland Bouldering Guide</a> as it covers the areas in depth.</p>

<h2 id="fgelberget">Fågelberget</h2>

<p><a href="http://27crags.com/crags/fagelberget">Fågelberget</a> is the sector that’s furthest away - about 5 km of approach. If you’re going there for the first time like us, don’t make the mistake of following the electricity lines! After a bit of a detour we arrived after an hour of walking at the Puerto Rico block which would be our basecamp. We warmed up on some of its routes and then took a look at some of the other blocks around.</p>

<p>We tried some of the classics here, I did bit of theatre on a Highball, then we headed back with a stop at the roofs and then we walked out as dusk was falling. It was a mighty fine day and if it wouldn’t have been for the long approach we probably would have visited it again. Neverland was proud line that looked super high, and Florian tried the “Over the Moon” problem, a 7b Highball. Definitely an area you should visit on your bouldering visit to Åland, as even on a cloudy and windy day as we had it’s a good sector with dozens of high-class problems.</p>

<h2 id="kasviken">Kasviken</h2>

<p><a href="https://27crags.com/crags/kasviken">Kasviken</a> is the sector with the best approach: Park car responsibly next to the road, walk 2 minutes and you’re standing in front of Dodo in the centre of the sector! It’s also a sector where you really start to have fun if you climb 6c/ 7a and better, as there’s a lot of HARD problems here. There’s no shortage of 7c and up problems, most of it overhanging. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15252817094" title="Light &amp; Shadow by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7471/15252817094_7332a02ba8_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Light &amp; Shadow" /></a>

<p>The location is beautiful up on a hill with well established paths and quite good landing zones. As it’s such a convenient place to go we went there twice and always met some people, but we never had to queue for a problem. There forest floor is also covered in blueberry shrubs, so a tasty &amp; healthy snack is never far away! We visited Kasviken two times and all five of us enjoyed the sector. This is definitely the sector to visit if you’re here only for a short time and don’t want to waste it on a long approach!</p>

<h2 id="grottan">Grottan</h2>

<p><a href="https://27crags.com/crags/grottan">Grottan</a>, also known as Djupviksgrottorna, was probably my favourite sector. The 2 km approach is along a super well-marked trail from the Soltuna Café - you basically walk on a nature trail there. The sector is on top of a hill with vast views and if t’s sunny you definitely want to bring enough to drink. Problems are mostly vertical and overhanging, and also here there’s a very high number of hard problems from 7b and up. Happily there were also plenty of easier boulders!</p>

<p>Here I ticked a few nice problems and enjoyed the good atmosphere at the sector. Great views, a nice breeze to cool down, lots of autumn sun and an easy approach make this definitely the 3rd sector you should visit when on Åland for your boulder holidays! </p>

<h2 id="gunnarsklint">Gunnarsklint</h2>

<p><a href="https://27crags.com/crags/gunnarsklint">Gunnarsklint</a> seems a relatively new sector that’s also not that easy to approach. I think we were hiking for about 45 minutes through the forest until we were finally there. While there are some nice problems the area doesn’t seem to be visited that often, so you should bring a brush or two to clean the lines you want to climb. On the plus side were the nice views from the top of the hill!</p>

<h2 id="rest-days">Rest Days</h2>

<p>As you can’t climb every day hard we had a rest day, too. We visited an old ruin, went sea kayaking, played Mini Golf, went grocery shopping and simply relaxed in our fine house. Sauna, star gazing, eating, enjoying the stillness of the island - Åland is a gorgeous place and it would be easy to spend more than a week here and never get bored. There’s so much to see and try that it definitely is worth a visit, even if you don’t boulder!</p>

When you go to Åland you can find ALL accommodation options on the <a href="http://www.visitaland.com/en/service_category/cottages-cottage-villages/">Visit Åland Cottages &amp; Holiday Villages</a>, <a href="http://www.visitaland.com/en/service_category/hotels/">Hotels</a> and <a href="http://www.visitaland.com/en/service_category/bed-breakfast-hostels/">B&amp;B</a> pages. There’s also <a href="http://www.visitaland.com/en/service_category/campsites/">campsites</a> if you prefer these. </p>

<p>A car is essential if you want to go on a road trip and travel on the Åland islands (although there are also busses there!). If you want to hire a car in Finland look no further than <a href="http://www.finnrent.fi/en/frontpage/">Finn-Rent</a>. They’re hands down the best place to rent a car with friendly service, competitive prices and great cars. We hired an <a href="http://www.finnrent.fi/en/category/minibuses/">Opel Vivaro Minibus</a> which carried all our gear, four crashpads and five persons in comfort and style. It also was super gas efficient and we drove over 1500 km on one tank load!</p>

<p>We got to Åland and back to Finland with <a href="http://www.sales.vikingline.com">Viking Line</a> and were especially lucky to be on the <a href="http://www.vikingline.fi/vikinggrace">M/S Viking Grace</a> on the way back which was a modern and beautiful ship. We enjoyed lounging on the comfy sofas and enjoyed the views from deck, and it was fast &amp; punctual, too!</p>

<p>We were very happy to visit <a href="http://www.boulderkeskus.com/fi/">Boulderkeskus Isatis</a> and enjoyed climbing there on our stops in Helsinki. It’s a great climbing gym with a well-sorted shop, Café and a cool gym to work out. You even can do yoga there and go to the sauna!</p>

<p>Gear-wise we had support from <a href="http://vandernet.fi/petzl">Petzl</a> and <a href="http://vandernet.fi/sport.php?k=16273">Jetboil</a> with a crashpad, rope and stove as well as crashpads from <a href="http://www.madrockclimbing.com">Mad Rock</a> via <a href="http://www.nihilclimbing.com">Nihil</a>. Without the crashpads there would have been no bouldering (or more broken ankles, which ain’t helpful on a boulder holiday) and the rope was very useful on our visits to some of the sports and trad crags. The Jetboil Joule boiled water for noodles and drinks in no time in group-sized measures. </p>

<p>In Vaasa we joined a day out bouldering with my climbing club <a href="http://www.highsport.fi">High Sport</a> and you can join them too for the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/756649124396284/">Vaasa BoulderFest 2015</a> which promises to be awesome. Vaasa offers some superb bouldering and there’s a dozen sectors with hundreds of problems within 10 km of the city centre!</p>

<p>Finally, my thanks to Christoph, Florian, Freddy and Nico who came here to climb! It was a pleasure to host you four and I’m looking forward to climb and boulder with you soon again. Also make sure to check our Nico’s photos on <a href="http://vertical-axis.de">Vertical Axis</a> as he’s a very talented photographer with a great eye &amp; vision and I certainly learned a thing or two from him.</p>

<p>As usually, you can see more photos in the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/sets/72157647589227685">Åland Album on Flickr</a>.</p>
