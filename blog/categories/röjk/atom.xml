    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The venerable hoody - a longsleeved shirt with an attached hood. It’s a great garment because you can never lose your hood - unlike your hat or cap - and thus always have something to keep your neck and head warm. It’s great between spring and autumn, when it allows you to leave your sleeping hat at home; but really shines in winter, when cold wind and sub-zero temperatures dig into your skin and you’re happy to pull that hood over your head and zip it closed, so that there’s less skin exposed to the elements. </p>

<p><strong>Five different Hoodys compared. Cthulhu approved.</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/smartwool-midweight-hoody-wollhoody/">Smartwool Midweight Hoody</a> appeared last year in La Maison Morkel, and has been worn a lot since. Skiing, hiking, cycling, walking with my son - it’s a trusty companion between September and May. Made of 100% Merino Wool it hugs you with all that soft warmness, as if you’re lying down next to one of them fine Merino Sheep who donated its wool to make it. The Merino used is a thicker weave than in the BPL Beartooth, which makes it 37 gram heavier - and a lot warmer. The hood is great, it has thumbloops, and a deep zipper for good ventilation when you’re running warm. The thumbloops are the best in my opinion, they warm your hands up quickly, are super-comfortable and easily layer over/ under gloves. My favourite Merino hoody for winter.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://rojk.se/index.php/en/tvister-helmet-hood-3">Tvister Helmet Hood</a> from Röjk has my favourite hood from the bunch; it thus is no surprise that it won the <em>Best Design and Innovation at the Innovation for Extremes Awards</em>, too. It’s a damn fine hood, creating a nice tunnel and thus more protection from wind, snow and rain; and unlike its brethern in this article, doesn’t hang down your back when you’re not wearing it, but stands nicely there, keeping your neck warm. I lament the absence of thumbloops, though Jan assured me that in the next reincarnation it will have those. No zip means no venting, but their unique Tvister Fabric - a <em>half-layer insulation</em> fabric is supposed to keep your temperature just right, which is not the case for me - I just run warm and to cool down need to open the outer layer. They’re ethically made in Europe, and come in swell colours. My favourite hoody for day hikes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8170147444/" title="Rab Baseline Hoody by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8207/8170147444_61641b1f52_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Rab Baseline Hoody" /></a></p>

<p>The Rab <a href="http://rab.uk.com/products/mens-clothing/baselayer/baseline-hoodie.html">Baseline Hoodie</a> is a hoody made from Polartec Power Dry. That’s a mad material, let me tell you: It wicks the moistness away from your skin, and even if the complete garment is drenched in your sweat, you feel dry. I was utterly surprised when I undressed after some skiing last winter to find out that I felt dry, but that the outsode of the hoody was moist. Genius. The zippered chest pocket keeps an energy bar or two, the zip goes acceptably deep for ventilating, just the thumbloops could be improved - they’re OK, but not as comfy as others here. If I go out skiing in winter, this is the hoody I’m most likely wearing.</p>

<h2 id="silkbody-cellular-pilot-top">Silkbody Cellular Pilot Top</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8170159564/" title="Silkbody Cellular Pilot Top by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7113/8170159564_f654efa13c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Silkbody Cellular Pilot Top" /></a></p>

<p>For over two years I hike, ski &amp; snowshoe in this hoody, and there have been a lot of questions about it. The <a href="http://www.silkbody.co.nz/man/outdoor/cellular-pilot-top-men-only.html">Silkbody Cellular Pilot Top</a> has a lot of great details going for it: sunglasses slots, off-centre front zip, thumb loops, flat seams and a ninja hood. It’s also unique because it made from 80% Silk (and 20% Merino), making for a comfortable feeling. It keeps you warm when you need it to, and cool when the heat would allow you to fry eggs in your Ti pan (without fire). The superb Ninja hoody goes over your nose, so no need for a Balaclava with this one; and thanks to the off-centre zip and stormflap behind it nothing rubs against your skin. An year-round usable hoody, though in deep winter it needs something extra over it.</p>

<p>The out-of-production BPL Beartooth Hoody is probably THE ultralight hoody. It’s a lovely garment, and there isn’t really a hoody available yet that has replaced it. It’s a thin and fine Merino weave, but surprisingly warm - though I’d not wear it in deep winter, to be honest. But I find it perfect from spring to autumn, where it is the perfect package - a deep zip for venting, thumbloops for extra warmth, and a good hood which also works great for sleeping. It’s my pick for cold spring and autumn trips. If you’re able to get one, take it!</p>

<h2 id="the-ultimate-hoody">The Ultimate Hoody</h2>

<p>The Ultimate Hoody is ethically made (wherever, but fair wages are paid and working conditions are excellent) from renewable and recyclable materials. It wicks the sweat away like the Rab Baseline Hoody, has the thumbloops of the Smartwool Midweight Hoody, looks as good as the Silkbody Cellular Pilot Top and makes use of their off-centre zip (which will be deeper for better venting) and combines their Ninja hood with the Röjk Tvister’s hood. It’s as light as the BPL Beartooth, and comes in a host of fresh colours.</p>

    <updated>2012-05-15T16:15:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://hendrikmorkel.github.com/2012/05/interview-jan-betros-of-rojk</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I am interviewing Jan Betros from Sweden, Founder of Röjk. &lt;a href=”http://rojk.se/”target=”_blank”&gt;Röjk&lt;/a&gt; is a young company which makes garments that are very functional, stylish and have proper ethical and sustainable credentials. In this interview Jan highlights how he started the company, the ideas that drive his designs and what we can expect in the future from Röjk! <br /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7202349350/" title="Me hiking Yellow mountains in China by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7238/7202349350_19f93ff2d7_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Me hiking Yellow mountains in China" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Jan, please briefly introduce yourself and tell us who you are. Since when are you backpacking &amp; bikepacking, and how did you start?</strong><br />
I am rased and born in Stockholm near the archipelagos, mountains, sea and nature was always close. I spent my youth as a professional gymnast and finally when I was 21 I moved to Annecy in the French Alps to spend time for hiking, skiing, rock climbing and cycling. For five years I was backpacking and skiing around the world and earned my living by working in ski- and mountainshops. My interest for making innovative sportswear grew and finally I started my studies at University of Derby with Performance Sportswear Design. With the help of my seamstress grandmother in Sweden I made my first prototype of the Tvister Helmet Hood who in 2007 won the Innovation For Extremes Prize for best design and innovation. After the award I got a lot of publicity and the brand RÖJK SUPERWEAR was introduced to the market in fall 2009.<br /></p>

<p><strong>How often are you outdoors hiking, skiing or backpacking nowadays?</strong><br />
Unfortunately not as often as I used to, but at least I get to make awesome gear for everyone who spends time in the outdoors :)<br /></p>

<p><strong>Are you more of a “weekend hiker” or do you have some long distance trips under your belt?</strong><br />
Nowadays I am more of a weekend hiker because of a lot of work but I always plan at least one or two long backpacking trips every year.<br /></p>

<p><strong>Which category would you put yourself in: SUL, UL, Lightweight or Bushcraft</strong>? What is your typical baseweight?**<br />
Well as weekend hiker I hike rather light, average is around 30 - 45 liters but for my backpacking trips where I am aways for at least 2 or 3 month I carry 60-70 liters.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7202350426/" title="The Röjk Superwear base.2 by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7096/7202350426_ecc38ed75c_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="The Röjk Superwear base.2" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Please tell us where the name “Röjk” came from, and what it stands for.</strong><br />
RÖJK is a shortage for RÖJÅK which is an expression for the PERFECT RIDE. It’s all about the perfect ride and making things perfect :)<br /></p>

<p><strong>Röjk designs functional garments, which are Made in Portugal &amp; Sweden. Can you tell us how the idea to start the company emerged and how you see its future?</strong>
Röjk makes innovative and attractive garments. We make all our garments in Portugal, all beanies and socks in Sweden. The idea for Röjk is to make garments that look good, with versatile use. For example our Helmet Hood can be used for running, skiing, hiking and cycling. Our liner socks can be used for hiking, skiing, running, cycling and with jeans or a suit instead of a cotton sock! We will continue so make more versatile garments mainly for the average people, backpackers and for everyone who likes to spend time int the outdoors. Garments will include running, light hiking, cycling, yoga, backpacking, travelling, surfing, and for everyone who enjoys the good things in life :)</p>

<p><strong>What makes Röjk different from other outdoor companies?</strong>
Well many things actually, first of all we are a small and independent company and they are big companies! We are focusing on the average person who is not particularly a top athlete but who likes adventures and sports but wants something that is of great quality and good looking as well. The old and big outdoor brands are focusing on the hardcore user and uses the term “Outdoor” but for us we are the new and next generation and we are focusing on “what is now” and we rather use the term Backpacker and Adventurer. I try to find gaps rather than making things that already exists.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7202348814/" title="Me backpacking in Portugal by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7090/7202348814_8c7632b54d_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" alt="Me backpacking in Portugal" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Your company makes its garments in Europe, and uses recyclable materials, so does pretty well in environmental terms. What brought this decision on?</strong>
Well I thought that if I want to make garments that are suitable for spending most time in nature then of course I should try to be nice to nature. Simple as that :)</p>

<p><strong>Röjk is starting to get more exposure in outdoor blogs lately; how about magazines, are they featuring your goods?</strong> 
We have only been on the market for 3 years and things are going fast. We have not been active with making press releases etc. - mostly because we wanted to make the company grow a little bit by itself. Now and then we can see our stuff in both national and international magazines, it’s great that they chose our stuff and to write good things about us. </p>

<p>**Can you tell us a bit how you went about the design process of the Tvister Hoody, and where the inspiration came from? **
I wanted to develop the ultimate and versatile hoody of all time, something that no one else had made and so simply that it would make the big brands wonder why they never thought of that, and so I did :). I started to put on many different layers of tops from layer 1 to layer 3 and eliminated everything that was uncomfortable such as zips, pockets, seams on wrong places and finally I narrowed it down to what i need and do not need in my hoody. Finally the design of the garment had tvisted arms, a balaclava shaped hood that can be used under a helmet and thereof the name. When I was done with the construction I thought I would make the design different and something that everyone can recognize and I made the asymmetrical colors.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7202348268/" title="bild by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7226/7202348268_15a54a074f_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="bild" /></a></p>

<p><strong>You use a lot of bright colours in your garments, and aren’t afraid to mix it up. This and your garments asymmetric seams make Röjk garments stand out. Are you do this to simply differentiate yourself, or what’s the story behind these?</strong><br />
Well at first I understood that I have to stand out and I wanted people to see what a Röjk garment is without having to see the name. I thought that why would the shops want to buy Röjk if it looks like everything else so I would be more safe by standing out rather than not standing out. And in the end of the day I want to make garments that I like to wear :)<br /></p>

<p><strong>Jan, we love to be let in on the work-in-progress stuff! Can you let us know what kind of new products you’re working on at the moment?</strong><br />
Well, we are developing our first spring/ summer range that will be on the markets spring 2014 which will include bikewear, running and backpacking. And for next fall we have developed some cool compression garments and more hoodys and T-shirts in merino wool, I love hoodys and t-shirts and can’t have enough of them :)<br /></p>

<p><strong>Any new lightweight materials that have you all excited?</strong><br />
There’s so many but I am working really close with PrimaLoft right now to develop a lightweight range in PrimaLoft.<br /></p>

<p><strong>How works the R&amp;D at Röjk, do you have a need yourself that you try to fix, or do some of your clients inspire you for new products and ask you for solutions to their problems?</strong><br />
So far it has been mostly me finding new solutions but as we grow we are getting a lot of feedback and many requests. We also have our friends who we call “Superheros”, they are professional athletes who can test our garments and new developments on an intense way and give us a great feedback. <br /></p>

<p><strong>Where do your customer come from?</strong><br />
Tricky question, it varies a lot but mostly from they’re adventurers, backpackers and the average person who is off for a short trip and wants something really good &amp; attractive!<br /></p>

<p><strong>Do you think the lightweight backpacking principles will become more popular and break into the mass market, or will it continue to be something for a small group of people?</strong><br />
I think it is growing and more people are asking for it, however I think that the demand is higher than the supply.<br /></p>

<p><strong>Are you in touch with other smaller manufacturers in Europe, the USA, Japan, and other places?</strong><br />
Not really as we have not had the time really to focus on others but we have plans on working more close with other small manufacturers.<br /></p>

<p><strong>What is your own favorite backpack, sleep system and shelter?</strong><br />
I just bought an OSPREY Exos 58 wich will be perfect for my shorter trips, I have a Hilleberg Nallo 2 GT and Thermarest NeoAir Xlite. I have so much gear for different occasions.<br /></p>

<p><strong>Any other favourite piece of gear which you always carry with you?</strong><br />
I’m a bit of a gear-nerd and I have many bit’s and pieces :)<br /></p>

<p><strong>When and where was your last backpacking/ skiing/ bikepacking trip?</strong><br />
This March I went with a friend to Switzerland for one week to ski. It was great, we stayed in a French town called Bulle and everyday we went to a new place to ski. Last summer I went to Australia for three months. First I went skiing for 2 months in the snowy mountains of NSW and then went off backpacking and rock climbing for a month. I also have a big crush on Portugal and I go there at least five times every year mainly for the manufacturing of our great garments and while I’m there I go for backpacking, surfing, rock climbing and I enjoy the nice wine :) <br /></p>

<p><strong>And where is your dream backpacking/ skiing/ bikepacking trip taking you?</strong><br />
I really need to go back to New Zeeland and see all of it. I plan to go to Patagonia this fall to go rock climbing and I want to ski in Japan, damn so many places I still need to explore and lets not forget about Finland, I need to see more of Finland as well.<br /></p>

<p><strong>Are you planning to get out for a trip soon, and enjoy the Swedish spring?</strong><br />
Yes, me and my girlfriend are first going hiking Kungsleden in the north of Sweden for a week, then I’m going with some friends to Riksgränsen to celebrate Swedish midsummer and do some late spring skiing. We are also going to Portugal for two months to do some backpacking, surfing and take a language course in Portuguese. Besides from these plans I always have many spontaneous trips going, live is good :)<br /></p>
