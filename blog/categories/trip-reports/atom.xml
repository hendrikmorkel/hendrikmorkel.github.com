<p>We had one objective for our visit to Kaiserwinkl: Do one of the Via Ferrata and shoot some great photos. We got that done on our first afternoon - and now had plenty of time on our hands to do other cool activities. First on our list was packrafting.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22864936066/in/album-72157653403675729/" title="Taking in the view"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5783/22864936066_5e965e21ff_b.jpg" width="1024" height="684" alt="Taking in the view" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="packrafting-on-the-tiroler-ache">Packrafting on the Tiroler Ache</h2>

<p><em>Could I loan your packraft?</em> Vincent asked me before the trip. Sure, no problem. <em>And could you teach me some packrafting, too?</em> Again, no problem, after all I enjoy <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/guided-trips/">teaching packrafting</a>. </p>

<p>We joined <a href="http://ack-koessen.at/?page_id=6">Adventure Club Kaiserwinkl</a> on one of their Adventure Rafting trips, this made transport very easy and I didn’t need to bring paddles or safety gear along. Dressed up in a neoprene suit with a vest and helmet and a paddle we set off to the entry point close to Kössen. The Tiroler Ache is a beautiful river, and the ~7 km section we would packraft would run through deep canyons which have a lot of history - there were smuggler paths in the war through the forests, and a pretty castle stands high above the river. </p>

<p>After some instructions and tips for the packrafting newbie we were off on the fast flowing river, and it was nice that we didn’t need to paddle a lot. The rapids were easy (up to Class II) and especially the Waschmaschine rapid was super fun. Vincent mastered them superbly and it was such a good run that we decided to come back a second time a day later. You could paddle until the Chiemsee in Bavaria, Germany on the Tiroler Ache so there’s plenty of potential for a Microadventure on this river. Wel also met some cool paddlers who were eager to test my packraft, and later shared a beer and some Kanebulla with them at the parking lot =)</p>

<h2 id="canyoning">Canyoning</h2>

<p>We almost didn’t need to take our neoprene suits off before the packrafting - because we were <a href="http://ack-koessen.at/?page_id=14">Canyoning</a> before it! I have been canyoning once before at the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2012/06/adventures-around-lago-didro.html">Lago d’Idro</a> in Italy and loved it. There’s just something very exciting and exhilarating when you enter a deep canyon and know the only way out is following the river down. Jumping over 10 m waterfalls into deep, cold pools sounds crazy - but is so much fun, and definitely a memorable experience. </p>

<p>We drove to a deep canyon with Markus Dagn, our guide from <a href="http://ack-koessen.at">Adventure Club Kaiserwinkl</a> and after a short walk up to the canyon we started with a rappel into the canyon. After Markus pulled the rope there was just one way out: Down the canyon. We jumped into pools, rappelled down waterfalls and slid down smooth rocks that the water has formed over centuries. Far above us was the green roof of the trees and the blue sky, but around us where the dark walls which seemed to be tipping over. After a bit less than an hour and plenty of jumps into cold pools we came out of the canyon, with a big smile on our face. We high-fived each other, rolled the neoprene suits down to let the warm sun on our skin and hiked back to the car. </p>

<h2 id="an-e-mtb-tour-to-the-heuberg">An E-MTB Tour to the Heuberg</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.kaiserwinkl.com/sommer/radsport/e-bikes.html">Electrical Mountain biking</a>. Yes, I was <em>a bit</em> sceptical about this activity. But I also was curious - we have been pondering getting an E-Assisted Cargobike for a while and this would be a good opportunity to see what such an Electric motor on a bike can do. Well, it can do a lot. The 940 m of ascent didn’t make me even break into a sweat, as the E-assist motor is so efficient and powerful that we were just <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/336849079">flying up the trails</a> to the Heuberg. </p>

<p>We picked the Heuberg because it is a scenic, cone-shaped peak and the views from it should be good (they are!). The ride up was fast and also involved some hike-you-e-bike and a short hike without bikes to the summit, and the ride down taught me the lesson that on the downhill it’s smart to put the e-assist off unless you want almost bomb down into the forest. But E-Mountainbikes: There’s no challenge anymore in pedaling up the hill. It doesn’t matter how steep the hill is, as long as you’re able to sit or stand on the bike the motor will pretty much drive you up. Which I enjoyed. But at the same time I wouldn’t do it again. I’d prefer to pedal up with my own power, or then push the bike. If you like it - then you’re in luck: There’s plenty of recharging stations in Kaiserwinkl and it’s part of the largest E-Bike network in the world! There’s ~1.000 km of cycling paths in nine different regions and 45 towns, and loaning an E-MTB is as easy as walking into the <a href="http://www.kaiserwinkl.com/de/sommer/radsport/e-bikes/e-bike-akkuladestation.html">Tourist Information in Walchsee</a>.</p>

<h2 id="via-ferrata">Via Ferrata</h2>

<p>There’s three <a href="http://www.kaiserwinkl.com/en/summer/hiking/climbing.html">Via Ferratas close Walchsee</a>, one beginner VF and two in the D and D/E difficulty. We decided to go for the Bergkameraden Steig. It’s steep at the beginning and has after the bridge some overhanging sections, but after that it gets easier and the descent is going through the nice forest and you come out directly at the Ottenalm Café, where you can grab a coffee and cake to reward yourself for the good climbing you just did! The Via Ferratas all get the afternoon sun and can get hot, so take something to drink along when you go in!</p>

<h2 id="visiting-the-kaiserwinkl">Visiting the Kaiserwinkl</h2>

<p>This was my first visit to the Kaiserwinkl, and I enjoyed it a lot. The highlights definitely were the tasty Kaiserschmarrn at the Fischerwirt, that is an absolute recommendation to go &amp; taste when you visit Walchsee. Also the activities were a lot of fun, with the packrafting and canyoning being the activities I enjoyed the most. Besides these there are plenty more things you can do, from hiking &amp; mountaineering to paragliding and swimming in the lake, Kaiserwinkl offers it all, always with the great view on the Wilder and Zahmer Kaiser mountains. </p>

<p>I travelled to Kaiserwinkl and Walchsee after my visit to <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/11/spring-adventures-in-kronplatz.html">Kronplatz</a>, that was very easy as we just jumped of the train in Kufstein (a beautiful city, by the way) and got a ride with <a href="http://taxikitzbichler.jimdo.com">Taxi Kitzbichler</a> to Walchsee. As Kaiserwinkl is a mere 130 km from the Airport in Munich it’s also possible to hire a car at the airport and drive to Walchsee yourself, though it’s easy enough to get around with public transportation or bikes.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22668169527/in/album-72157653403675729/" title="Walchsee"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5631/22668169527_0fb7f46a1a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Walchsee" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We stayed at the <a href="http://www.bellevue-walchsee.at">Ferienclub Bellevue am Walchsee</a>, which is a rather large hotel and hence has a lot ot offer, especially if you’re going with the family: There’s a large swimming pool inside and outside, a Sauna area, lots of play grounds and a kindergarden when the parents want to relax an afternoon. You can rent bikes and they have good food. Oh, and they’re directly at the Walchsee lake, so fishermen can just jump into a boat and try their luck. </p>

<p>Walchsee is just one of several small villages in the <a href="http://www.kaiserwinkl.com">Kaiserwinkl</a>. It’s small enough that you can walk everywhere, but there’s plenty of nice Cafés, Restaurant and shops that you don’t get bored. And there’s plenty of great outdoor activities available - as you saw above. There’s more photos on Flickr in the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/sets/72157653403675729/">Kaiserwinkl Album</a> to get you in the mood for a visit to this beautiful corner of Tirol!</p>

Vincent and me visited it earlier in May and went paragliding, hiking and almost did a Via Ferrata! </p>

<!-- more -->

<p>After an enjoyable journey to Bruneck in South Tyrol via München Airport it was time to explore the region. I had quite a lot of things planned for the three days I was there, but that first afternoon I was “free” and so just went for a stroll through the fields surrounding the Hotel Rudolf and checking out the Sauna. Well rested, it was off to bed early.</p>

<h2 id="via-ferrata-furcia-rossa">Via Ferrata Furcia Rossa</h2>

<p><strong>Or: Hiking in the Fanes-Sennes-Prags National Park</strong>. The Furcia Rossa Via Ferrata was the main reason for this trip, and <a href="http://matthiaslarcher.com">Mountain Guide Matthias Larcher</a> picked me up early in the morning. We got along well right from the start, both being dads and loving the mountains we had plenty to chat about on the drive to the <a href="http://www.suedtirol.info/en/Destinations--Things-To-Do/Hiking--Mountaineering/Nature-Reserves/detail/c28fb61a-bb63-451e-9d93-8fa0fb034f16/Fanes-Senes-BraiesFanes-Sennes-Prags-Nature-Reserve.html">Fanes-Sennes-Prags National Park</a>. We arrived to an empty parking lot, packed the last bit of kit and then were off. The trail was steep from the start until we reached a high valley, where we hiked on nice wide trails to the start of the Furcia Rossa. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22274601863/in/album-72157653077170250/" title="Wide paths in the Fanes-Sennes-Prags National Park"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/701/22274601863_117a322167_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Wide paths in the Fanes-Sennes-Prags National Park" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Snow had fallen up higher during the previous night, and Matthias wasn’t sure if we would be able to actually do the Via Ferrata completely. After we took a turn and followed the a sign to the Via Ferrata, we came across the first fresh snow patches. The higher we got the more snow there was, and while I was once again wearing approach shoes which had good grip in the snow, it looked like a not very smart undertaking to continue further up - Matthias thought the steel wires likely will be covered underneath quite a bit of snow, and while it is an easy Via Ferrata it is very long and takes a whole day to complete. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22477426878/in/album-72157653077170250/" title="Enjoying the view"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5835/22477426878_b3e291f64d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Enjoying the view" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>As the snow got shin deep and the weather looked like it will turn to the worse, we decided together to call it a failed attempt and just turn around. We had a wee lunch as we were back at the main trail, and then just enjoyed the lovely scenery which we had all to ourselves on this late May day. In the early afternoon as we were back at the car we had <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/336849083">clocked in some 18 km</a> and lots of nice views. Also the Fanes-Sennes-Prags National Park looked well off the beaten track and Matthias told me that while it gets busy in the main summer months, pre- and post-summer you almost can have the trails to yourself. Definitely a Nationalpark I want to check out more in the future.</p>

<h2 id="messner-mountain-museum-ripa">Messner Mountain Museum Ripa</h2>

<p>There are six <a href="http://www.messner-mountain-museum.it/en/">Messner Mountain Museums</a> and the region Kronplatz has two: <a href="http://www.messner-mountain-museum.it/en/ripa/museum/">Ripa</a> in the old, beautiful Bruneck castle and the brand-new <a href="http://www.messner-mountain-museum.it/en/corones/museum/">Corones</a> which opened this summer after my visit. We went to Ripa and really enjoyed it, especially the Meditation cellar with the beautiful music was a real highlight for me, and I could spend more time in such a place:</p>

<iframe width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zugVQS52VPA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>At Ripa the exhibition presents mountain people from Asia, Africa, South America &amp; Europe, and reflects on their cultures, religions and tourism activities in their regions. There’s quite a bit if original art which was very beautiful and inspiring, as were the different views on the cultures and how the mountain people have lived. The main tower has a viewing platform which has a great view of Kronplatz Mountain, Bruneck and the valley.</p>

<h2 id="hiking-up-to-the-kronplatz">Hiking up to the Kronplatz</h2>

<p>After the visit to the MMM we went for a stroll through Bruneck, had some light lunch and a coffee and then decided to hike up to the Kronplatz. After 14 o’clock we left the hotel with our light packs for the summit, and the staff was a bit concerned that we might not make it to the top and back as it was supposed to be a long walk. The signs suggested that one needs four hours from Reischach to the summit, though we did it <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/336849087">in about two hours</a>. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22273133964/in/album-72157653077170250/" title="Trailmarkings"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/663/22273133964_cc1157774b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Trailmarkings" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The AVS trail up was OK, it was a tad boring at times but it was an efficient trail which didn’t make any detours, which at least I appreciate. At the top it was windy, and the noise from the construction site for the sixth and final Messner Mountain Museum also wasn’t pleasant, but the views were great. From the top of the Kronplatz you have a great view on the Dolomites - if you don’t mind the ski lifts and water reservoirs. Alas, those are a part of the modern ski business.</p>

<p>After hanging out at the summit plateau for a while we headed down again, and the narrow trail sections were so awesome that I just needed to run parts of them down! The light of course was getting much better the lower we got, and we both lamented that we needed to head back down for dinner! In the end we did the ~1000 m of ascent in around 5 hours up and &amp; down, so if you’re a fit trailrunner who looks for some vertical this might be a nice hill to run up and down.</p>

<h2 id="paragliding-with-tandemflights-kronplatz">Paragliding with tandemflights Kronplatz</h2>

<p>We actually wanted to fly the previous day, but the strong winds didn’t allow us to start. At 7 o’clock in the morning, three hours before our train would leave again, Chris messaged me to let me know that he’ll pick us up at 8 o’clock and we would go paragliding! Vincent and me were ecstatic that it would work out after all. Punctually Chris and Leo from <a href="http://www.tandemflights-kronplatz.com">tandemflights Kronplatz</a> picked us up and we were in no time again at the summit of the Kronplatz where we had been just the previous afternoon. Just that this time we would be flying down instead of running the trails =) Leo &amp; Chris had the paragliders deployed in a couple of minutes, gave us instructions of what to do during take-off and landing, and then we were just waiting for the right wind. Once that moment came we were off in the air. </p>

<p>This was my second time paragliding and it was just as exciting as the first time. Even Chris and Leo, who have tens of thousands of flights between each other, had big smiles and were enjoying the great wind &amp; weather on this spring morning. We were some 15 to 20 minutes in the air until we came closer and closer to the ground, flying over freshly cut fields and walkers on their way to the summit. </p>

<h2 id="off-to-south-tyrol">Off to South Tyrol</h2>

<p>I love <a href="http://www.suedtirol.info/en/">South Tyrol</a>. I imagine it has to do with the family holidays that I spent there as a child, the friendly people, tasty food, the Dolomites and wonderful scenery. If I’m free to go wherever I want, chances are I will pick Südtirol. And if you like mountains, beautiful nature, great National Parks and trails, friendly locals and delicious food, chances are you too will love South Tyrol - so give it a try on your next holiday.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22503687709/in/album-72157653077170250/" title="Signs on the top"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5651/22503687709_10c60caec3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Signs on the top" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I travelled to South Tyrol via München and then took the train. It is a pleasant journey and if you’re in no hurry then I can recommend this. The <a href="http://www.mobilcard.info/en/mobilcard.asp">Mobilcard Südtirol</a> allows you to travel with all busses and trains in the region and is ideal if you arrive with public transportation. You can take bikes along in the trains which makes bike tours through the valleys very easy - drive to your destination and hop on the train back or vice versa. Best of all, if you stay at a hotel in Südtirol you will often get the Card for free. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22709206980/in/dateposted/" title="Local train"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5833/22709206980_477d8af5b4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Local train" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I stayed at the superb <a href="http://www.hotel-rudolf.com">Rubner Hotel Rudolf</a> which delighted me with its very friendly staff, tasty food, comfy bed and relaxing sauna. It’s a great hotel 15 minutes walking outside of Bruneck in Reischach and an equally long walk to the lift station, so in a great position. They have <a href="http://www.hotel-rudolf.com/preise_sommer.html">affordable prices for summer</a> so would make for a great hotel to base yourself for a week - the Sauna and swimming pool were superb and very clean, and make for a great way to end a mountain day - be it hiking, climbing or paragliding. A shuttle to the railway station and back is included, too!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.kronplatz.com/de/bruneck">Bruneck</a> is a lively town which has everything to offer what you might need for an active week in South Tyrol. I counted a handful of outdoor and sports shops, a dozen cafés and a few supermarkets for snacks and local delicacies. It has its own railway station and also is easy to reach by car if you prefer that. </p>

<p>In March I let you in on a well-kept secret: That I will be going to the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/03/the-dolomites-rock-climbs-and-via-ferrata.html">Dolomites</a> in July. With four friends. A rental car. An obscene amount of climbing, camping, Via ferrata and backpacking gear. So obscene that I needed to ditch one of my twin-topes on my mate Stu, with whom I was flying out of Helsinki way to early on a Sunday morning. A good thing that a sweltering heat was welcoming us in Venice, as well as our three companions and a rental car. Packed to the brim with only a dim idea how to get to Cortina we directed our vehicle North. And somehow I was able to navigate us securely to the <a href="http://www.dolomiti.org/ita/cortina/laga5torri/ospitalita/CinqueTorri/index.html">Rifugio Cinque Torri</a>. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19259485003/in/album-72157656091400816/" title="Cinque Torri Refugio in the morning"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/350/19259485003_a0a9541eef_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Cinque Torri Refugio in the morning" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Gorgeous, stunning, breath-taking, <em>I love it</em>, where words that were uttered after the engine was switched off. We lost no time and shouldered ropes and climbing kit and hit the first crag, Torre Quarta Bassa. An easy 6a/ 5 Multi-Pitch route was picked for warm-up by Stu and me, as well as popping our Multi-Pitch Cherries. Our vocabulary soon was enhanced by meaningful phrases like <em>Where’s the next bolt?</em> and <em>That’s not a 5a!</em> As the sun was making the five beautiful towers of the Cinque Torri draw long shadows on the meadows we were rappelling down, walking back to the Rifugio. Dinner was calling, and so was the wine. </p>

<p>It’s common for climbers to get up early, and so we decided on a 6 o’clock start to climb a route on Cima Grande’s Southwest Face, which gets backed in the sun during the day. Rosamunde was climbed by Sam, Stu and me, and then breakfast was calling us back. Yes, half-board at the Rifugios is mandatory and highly recommended. </p>

<p>Stu and me were the Multi-Pitch team, and as we were in the company of a battalion of Italian soldiers it was the Via Normale on Torre Inglese which we climbed. There was exposure, sweaty palms, smiles, running it out, more smiles, squeezes and a hard-earned summit with trad gear. More smiles, two abseils and then some Apfelstrudel and Cappuccino. </p>

<p>A few easy climbs at the School of Rock sector on the way back to a hot shower and a slab attempt that ended with the rain. Doesn’t matter, because there’s wine, dinner, card games, laughter, sitting outside and taking in the view. The next morning it was up before sunrise at 5 o’clock and another attempt on the slab. Stu on-sighted it, I failed, and so it was back to breakfast, packing up and heading onwards.</p>

<p>A resupply in Cortina and we drove onwards. The Sorapiss Circuit was <em>The Plan™</em>. Car parked, backpacks with bivy gear shouldered and onwards we went. A coffee at the Rifugio on the way and up that lovely scree field in the 30°C heat. </p>

<p>It was getting late, the clouds were closing in, and so we stayed put at the end of the world. A un-secured hike 1000 m over a valley on narrow ledges was to be done fresh &amp; full of energy. The thunderstorms hitting us shortly after the bivies were rolled out made us congratulate ourselves for our smart decision. It was early to bed, sleep in, lightning storms all night. </p>

<p>As the sky cleared in the morning we decided against the sketchy approach, strolled back and drove to mountains with fairer weather. We found it in the Val Gardena, where we rolled out our sleeping bags on the Parking lot, shared wine with other campers and were looking forward to the Via Ferrata Brigata Tridentina.</p>

<p>The next morning a cloud inversion in the valley (<em>yeps, the opening photo</em>) made us dally around, but we were still in good time on the Via Ferrata and topped out happy at the top. A Kaiserschmarn later Matt, Sam, Stu and me explored the high plateau before it was back to the valley, which involved more scree, steel cables, snow fields and the urge to run it all down.</p>

<p>I rolled out my bivy under a Boulder Problem called Sella benath Sassolunga that night, taking in the fine view of a star-filled sky. </p>

<p>Easy climbs ensued the next morning after breakfast, followed by a check in to the fine <a href="http://www.dolomitesrefugeandhut.it">Rifugio Carlo Valentini</a>. A private bunk room, warm showers and more climbing followed by more showers followed, topped by a delicious dinner which had us wonder if we understood the quoted price right. The next morning saw us drive our car to the start of the Via delle Trincee Via Ferrata, the <em>most difficult</em> Via ferrata yet. An inexperienced Via Ferrata-ist before us had us wondering if we weren’t pokering too high, but as climbers we dispatched the first difficult bit in no time and hence enjoyed in peace the rest of the Via Ferrata. Suspension bridges, views on the Marmolada, ridge walks and caves made for an atmospheric hike. Just the long, steep walk back, we could have done without it.</p>

<p>And that was it. A long, or rather short night later I was on my way to the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/07/the-soa-jury-meeting.html">SOA Jury Meeting</a> and the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/08/outdoor-news-2015-i.html">OutDoor 2015</a>, while my good friends travelled on to other parts of the world. But we were sure of one thing: That we loved the Dolomites, and that we will be back. And if you like mountains, good food &amp; wine, great climbing and fun Via Ferratas, you too should pay the Dolomits a visit.</p>

<p>If you don’t <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hikinginfinland">follow along</a> you’re bound to think I fell off a mountain as I missed two <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/archives/">TWIRs</a>. But the truth was that I was in Poland. In Europes smallest, biggest mountains: The Tatras. </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As it’s almost a month ago that I published <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/05/a-lake-district-traverse.html">Part I</a> of my Lakeland Traverse and there have been several more trips since then, it’s time to hike on and bring it to a finish =)</p>

<p>After a calm night I wake up, have breakfast and smile because the sun is shining as I head up towards Sca Fell.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14112337924" title="Breakfast on Sca Fell"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7456/14112337924_7b04c0e430_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Breakfast on Sca Fell" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14278964730" title="Up to Sca Fell by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3884/14278964730_540e217c3a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Up to Sca Fell" /></a></p>

<p>I continue to smile, even as it gets more and more cloudy the nearer I get to the summit.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14100737371" title="Sca Fell in the mist by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7209/14100737371_aca59cc552_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Sca Fell in the mist" /></a></p>

<p>Once there, the summit is indeed dressed in clouds as, accompanied with a stiff breeze. Hardshell top and bottom come on, down I go.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14464228632" title="Foxes Tarn by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3851/14464228632_af387f9179_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Foxes Tarn" /></a></p>

<p>The descent to Foxes Tarn is nice though you should be sure-footed. The place itself looked clean and inviting for a camp, but I continued.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14464435354" title="Whaddyalookingat? by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2926/14464435354_ebe953770b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Whaddyalookingat?" /></a></p>

<p>Down a scrambly bit to the path up Scafell Pike. Good fun that section! Up on England’s highest hill I snap a Selfie and walk on. Views are good, people few.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14442477696" title="Scafell Pike by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5564/14442477696_133ca1fd87_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Scafell Pike" /></a></p>

<p>But it are the views from Bowfell that I enjoy most.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14278945979" title="Sca Fell &amp; Scafell Pike by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2921/14278945979_f9aeefc6de_b.jpg" width="680" height="1024" alt="Sca Fell &amp; Scafell Pike" /></a></p>

<p>I descend via the Flat Slabs and head onwards to the Old Dungeon Ghyll Climber’s Bar.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14465578885" title="Flat Slabs by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3885/14465578885_812eb60118_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Flat Slabs" /></a></p>

<p>A fine Ale, soup and a roll are consumed, and with not much enthusiasm I leave the fine establishment behind. My route takes me up to Stickle Tarn, where I count four other tents around the lake!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14485734013" title="Stickle Tarn by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3884/14485734013_8bbd3a8927_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Stickle Tarn" /></a></p>

<p>It’s windy and I’m soon in my quilt after a hot meal. It is a fiercely windy night and past midnight a couple descends to the valley past me under my TrailStar. Rain sets in occasionally. I drift in and out of sleep, and with dawn I’m up. The Coleman gas canister is empty (after just 3 l of water boiled!) and so I can’t have my morning coffee. Up I go, forgoing the scramble I came for.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14378696112" title="Above Stickle Tarn by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5040/14378696112_6157530f5f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Above Stickle Tarn" /></a></p>

<p>Drizzle and wind accompany me on my way to High Raise and onwards to Calf Crag, Gibson Knott and Helm Crag, before I descend to the village of Grasmere.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14193578570" title="Cloudy by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2938/14193578570_7f313cd441_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Cloudy" /></a></p>

<p>I buy a new gas canister and fruits, have a coffee and soup and head up Grisedale Tarn. The weather improves and the sun breaks through.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14465582995" title="Arriba by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5474/14465582995_f52759df3a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Arriba" /></a></p>

<p>My plan to go on to Helvellyn and walk its Ridges is dropped in favour of a low camp. But the valleys are private land and I don’t feel like sneaking into one of the woods to pitch my TrailStar and so end up in the Youth Hostel in Patterdale. A hot shower is enjoyed, and a good sleep is had.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14193489749" title="Looking up to Grisedale by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2939/14193489749_047e97d4e0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Looking up to Grisedale" /></a></p>

<p>Breakfast on the sofa, packing with plenty of space, wall to wall sunshine awaiting me. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/13948223152" title="That way by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2938/13948223152_b31fb818c2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="That way" /></a></p>

<p>Up to Angletarn Pikes. A lovely hill with fine views all the way.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/13948221232" title="Upwards by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7121/13948221232_2b2bbe2598_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Upwards" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14380144815" title="Lovely view by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2915/14380144815_d36e8bc42c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Lovely view" /></a></p>

<p>Angle Tarn is a wonderful place and would make a fine camping spot. Birds are swimming on its clear blue water, while the sun reflects in ripples as a slight breeze sweeps across it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14193530658" title="Angle Tarn by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3856/14193530658_46c3c33068_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Angle Tarn" /></a></p>

<p>The views from up here are magnificent, further enhenced by the superb weather. I walk with an open wind jacket and cuffs up, but soon decide it’s time to hike in my T-Shirt.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14193699467" title="Gate by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3837/14193699467_022eb5b942_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Gate" /></a></p>

<p>I take the faint path up Rest Dodd before heading down and up to The Knott. Time for coffee and Vitamin C in the sun, there’s no hurry anywhere.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14379174464" title="Coffee on The Knott by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2902/14379174464_06571c2c53_b.jpg" width="680" height="1024" alt="Coffee on The Knott" /></a></p>

<p>I stroll onwards to the High Street where plenty of day hikers enjoy the great weather. I shortly ponder a stroll up and down the Riggindale Crag, but decide to head onwards to the Thornthwaite Crag. A large cairn marker (more a tower, really) spends shade that is welcomed in this hot weather.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14193497129" title="Blue by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5231/14193497129_9eeb9496af_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Blue" /></a></p>

<p>The impending ridge walk of Froswick, Ill Bell and Yoke has me smiling ear to ear.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14379175414" title="Spikey by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5191/14379175414_3f63597556_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Spikey" /></a></p>

<p>Then water runs low and so I am looking out for water. Close to the Garburn Pass I find a gurgling stream and the Playtypuses are filled up and emptied right away. Tasty. So why not stay?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14380141145" title="Camp III by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2928/14380141145_b69ab58d1c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Camp III" /></a></p>

<p>I do. It’s beautiful and I love the views - Windermere to the south, the high hills to the west, crags, grass and sheep to the north and east. I have a mighty fine evening up on the hill, and fall asleep under the stars.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/13912268942" title="MLD TrailStar in the English Lake District. by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2900/13912268942_8066e0cef6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="MLD TrailStar in the English Lake District." /></a></p>

<p>The next morning the weather is again on repeat: Blue sky and sunshine. I take it slow, enjoy the last bit outside, but am soon enough on the trail. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14380137475" title="Troutbeck Tongue by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3918/14380137475_5f5a6dc457_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Troutbeck Tongue" /></a></p>

<p>Then I arrive at Orrest Head, Tourists being delighted by the view to be had from here. And also I smile, even as know that this will be the last time I will lay my eyes on the hills of the Lake District, those fine small mountains whom I just traversed. And so I walk down to the railway station, happy to return in the future.</p>
