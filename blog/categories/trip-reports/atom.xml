<p>If you don’t <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hikinginfinland">follow along</a> you’re bound to think I fell off a mountain as I missed two <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/archives/">TWIRs</a>. But the truth was that I was in Poland. In Europes smallest, biggest mountains: The Tatras. </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As it’s almost a month ago that I published <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/05/a-lake-district-traverse.html">Part I</a> of my Lakeland Traverse and there have been several more trips since then, it’s time to hike on and bring it to a finish =)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14057561889" title="Sca Fell camp by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5117/14057561889_18ae743375_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Sca Fell camp" /></a></p>

<p>After a calm night I wake up, have breakfast and smile because the sun is shining as I head up towards Sca Fell.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14112337924" title="Breakfast on Sca Fell"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7456/14112337924_7b04c0e430_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Breakfast on Sca Fell" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14278964730" title="Up to Sca Fell by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3884/14278964730_540e217c3a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Up to Sca Fell" /></a></p>

<p>I continue to smile, even as it gets more and more cloudy the nearer I get to the summit.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14100737371" title="Sca Fell in the mist by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7209/14100737371_aca59cc552_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Sca Fell in the mist" /></a></p>

<p>Once there, the summit is indeed dressed in clouds as, accompanied with a stiff breeze. Hardshell top and bottom come on, down I go.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14464228632" title="Foxes Tarn by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3851/14464228632_af387f9179_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Foxes Tarn" /></a></p>

<p>The descent to Foxes Tarn is nice though you should be sure-footed. The place itself looked clean and inviting for a camp, but I continued.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14464435354" title="Whaddyalookingat? by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2926/14464435354_ebe953770b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Whaddyalookingat?" /></a></p>

<p>Down a scrambly bit to the path up Scafell Pike. Good fun that section! Up on England’s highest hill I snap a Selfie and walk on. Views are good, people few.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14442477696" title="Scafell Pike by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5564/14442477696_133ca1fd87_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Scafell Pike" /></a></p>

<p>But it are the views from Bowfell that I enjoy most.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14278945979" title="Sca Fell &amp; Scafell Pike by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2921/14278945979_f9aeefc6de_b.jpg" width="680" height="1024" alt="Sca Fell &amp; Scafell Pike" /></a></p>

<p>I descend via the Flat Slabs and head onwards to the Old Dungeon Ghyll Climber’s Bar.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14465578885" title="Flat Slabs by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3885/14465578885_812eb60118_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Flat Slabs" /></a></p>

<p>A fine Ale, soup and a roll are consumed, and with not much enthusiasm I leave the fine establishment behind. My route takes me up to Stickle Tarn, where I count four other tents around the lake!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14485734013" title="Stickle Tarn by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3884/14485734013_8bbd3a8927_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Stickle Tarn" /></a></p>

<p>It’s windy and I’m soon in my quilt after a hot meal. It is a fiercely windy night and past midnight a couple descends to the valley past me under my TrailStar. Rain sets in occasionally. I drift in and out of sleep, and with dawn I’m up. The Coleman gas canister is empty (after just 3 l of water boiled!) and so I can’t have my morning coffee. Up I go, forgoing the scramble I came for.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14378696112" title="Above Stickle Tarn by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5040/14378696112_6157530f5f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Above Stickle Tarn" /></a></p>

<p>Drizzle and wind accompany me on my way to High Raise and onwards to Calf Crag, Gibson Knott and Helm Crag, before I descend to the village of Grasmere.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14193578570" title="Cloudy by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2938/14193578570_7f313cd441_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Cloudy" /></a></p>

<p>I buy a new gas canister and fruits, have a coffee and soup and head up Grisedale Tarn. The weather improves and the sun breaks through.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14465582995" title="Arriba by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5474/14465582995_f52759df3a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Arriba" /></a></p>

<p>My plan to go on to Helvellyn and walk its Ridges is dropped in favour of a low camp. But the valleys are private land and I don’t feel like sneaking into one of the woods to pitch my TrailStar and so end up in the Youth Hostel in Patterdale. A hot shower is enjoyed, and a good sleep is had.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14193489749" title="Looking up to Grisedale by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2939/14193489749_047e97d4e0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Looking up to Grisedale" /></a></p>

<p>Breakfast on the sofa, packing with plenty of space, wall to wall sunshine awaiting me. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/13948223152" title="That way by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2938/13948223152_b31fb818c2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="That way" /></a></p>

<p>Up to Angletarn Pikes. A lovely hill with fine views all the way.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/13948221232" title="Upwards by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7121/13948221232_2b2bbe2598_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Upwards" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14380144815" title="Lovely view by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2915/14380144815_d36e8bc42c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Lovely view" /></a></p>

<p>Angle Tarn is a wonderful place and would make a fine camping spot. Birds are swimming on its clear blue water, while the sun reflects in ripples as a slight breeze sweeps across it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14193530658" title="Angle Tarn by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3856/14193530658_46c3c33068_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Angle Tarn" /></a></p>

<p>The views from up here are magnificent, further enhenced by the superb weather. I walk with an open wind jacket and cuffs up, but soon decide it’s time to hike in my T-Shirt.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14193699467" title="Gate by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3837/14193699467_022eb5b942_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Gate" /></a></p>

<p>I take the faint path up Rest Dodd before heading down and up to The Knott. Time for coffee and Vitamin C in the sun, there’s no hurry anywhere.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14379174464" title="Coffee on The Knott by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2902/14379174464_06571c2c53_b.jpg" width="680" height="1024" alt="Coffee on The Knott" /></a></p>

<p>I stroll onwards to the High Street where plenty of day hikers enjoy the great weather. I shortly ponder a stroll up and down the Riggindale Crag, but decide to head onwards to the Thornthwaite Crag. A large cairn marker (more a tower, really) spends shade that is welcomed in this hot weather.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14193497129" title="Blue by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5231/14193497129_9eeb9496af_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Blue" /></a></p>

<p>The impending ridge walk of Froswick, Ill Bell and Yoke has me smiling ear to ear.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14379175414" title="Spikey by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5191/14379175414_3f63597556_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Spikey" /></a></p>

<p>Then water runs low and so I am looking out for water. Close to the Garburn Pass I find a gurgling stream and the Playtypuses are filled up and emptied right away. Tasty. So why not stay?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14380141145" title="Camp III by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2928/14380141145_b69ab58d1c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Camp III" /></a></p>

<p>I do. It’s beautiful and I love the views - Windermere to the south, the high hills to the west, crags, grass and sheep to the north and east. I have a mighty fine evening up on the hill, and fall asleep under the stars.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/13912268942" title="MLD TrailStar in the English Lake District. by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2900/13912268942_8066e0cef6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="MLD TrailStar in the English Lake District." /></a></p>

<p>The next morning the weather is again on repeat: Blue sky and sunshine. I take it slow, enjoy the last bit outside, but am soon enough on the trail. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14380137475" title="Troutbeck Tongue by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3918/14380137475_5f5a6dc457_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Troutbeck Tongue" /></a></p>

<p>Then I arrive at Orrest Head, Tourists being delighted by the view to be had from here. And also I smile, even as know that this will be the last time I will lay my eyes on the hills of the Lake District, those fine small mountains whom I just traversed. And so I walk down to the railway station, happy to return in the future.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Lake District is one of England’s most scenic National Parks, with steep hills, lush green valleys, glittering lakes and inviting Pubs. I traversed this beautiful area from Ravenglass to Windermere in a 125 km route and hiked up some of the most well-known mountains and camped at some beautiful sites.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14057613217" title="On the hills by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2916/14057613217_6cf64400c6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="On the hills" /></a></p>

<p><em>It’s funny to think that on the birthday of the website I started my Lake District hike. Funny, as English blogs were one of the inspirations to start this site, and on it’s fifth birthday I was setting off to backpack in one of the most popular National Parks in the UK.</em></p>

<p>The Lake District has long appealed to me, and with the help of <a href="http://www.visitengland.com/">Visit England</a> I was able to realize this trip. As I had six days for backpacking I early on decided that a traverse would be best to see as much as possible, and my list of things I’d like to see was long, as I explained in my “<a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/04/planning-a-trip-in-the-lake-district.html">Planning a Trip in the Lake District</a>” article. </p>

<p>So on Monday morning I left Manchester by train and arrived punctual at 10:55 o’clock in Ravenglass, where I meet <a href="http://stevenhorner.com/">Steven</a> and Traci who would join me for the first day. We had a quick lunch at the Café in the Railway Station and then set off towards the hills. Steven explained to me the system of paths in the UK - I still am baffled by it! - and soon we were hiking past cows to the Muncaster Castle. We passed it, eager to get to the hills, but before that a short stroll on the street was necessary. As someone from the continent the left side traffic was something to be well aware of, as you do everything just the other way around as you’d at home. The walk on the street was quickly done, and then it was off into the wild - or the swamp. For quite a bit we were searching for the path, which was marked on our maps, to Devoke Water, but in the end we just gave up, took an aim and just kept on walking. Surely enough, close to the lake we then happened upon a trail which we followed for a bit before a short break. I refilled my water bottles and we enjoyed the fine views over the lake. As we had still some bit to go we continued, following the path to Woodend and then up to Great Worm Crag. The mandatory first summit photo was taken, I made a few quick bolder moves and onwards to White How and Green Crag we continued.</p>

<p>While there was a path marked down on my map, the reality looked different. Through a swamp, which has claimed the life of a sheep or two, we made it with even wetter feet to the foot of Harter Fell. The sun was shining, the full water bottles added a couple of kilograms of weight and so we started our ascent. Grazing sheep were gazing as we passed them by in what must have seemed like snail speed to them, but then, finally, we made it to a large “plateau” which lays a dozen of meters under the summit. We walked the last bit up to the Summit Marker and enjoyed the wide views: To the West lay the sea and the Isle of Man, a bit further to the north the southern tip of Scotland came into view, and to the north Sca Fell and Scafell Pike dominated the view and demanded attention. Further to the east Brown Pike, Dow Crag and the Old Man of Coniston could be seen. It was a magnificent place to be.</p>

<p>With plenty of space to pitch the TrailStars Traci and Steven pitched theirs on the plateau, while I went a bit further up between two large boulders. As the wind picked up we ate dinner together, enjoyed the sunset and rising moon, and had a Finnish dessert before hitting the hay. During the night the wind turned and was blowing well into my shelter. Not being amused I just took out a peg which practically closed the TrailStar, and a more calm nicht could be enjoyed. I was up with the sunrise (the sun still rising <em>“late”</em> back then) though the high wind demanded that I wear all my layers. We packed up and said our good byes, Steven &amp; Traci heading back to Eskdale while I set off to the west. </p>

<p>Through the re-forested Hardknott Forest I made my way down as the sun was rising and promised a fine day. Down at the river I happened upon a Parking place with benches, which made for the perfect breakfast spot. I enjoyed the bird song and purl of the river, only once or twice interrupted by a passing car. Refilled with water I walked down the street, passing by the gorgeous houses in the valley. A mother who was carrying her daughter walked a horse to the meadow and greeted me with a smile, and it is easy to imagine how good life must be far off the beaten track between the hills. I hiked on, finding the sign and path which brought me on line with my first summit of the day. </p>

<p>After some backtracking and climbing fences I made it on the road to Walna Scar Road. This path is so wide that you three to four people could hike next to each other - but right now I was alone, just far off in the distance I could make out a few couples slowly making their way to the top. Along the Long House Gill stream the path climbed continuously up, and at the crossroad I sat down to have a zip of water and some nuts. A father and son couple was now following behind me. I packed up and continued, the summit of Brown Pike getting closer and closer. </p>

<p>As I reached the crossroad underneath the summit, the wind welcomed me. I said a <em>“Hiya”</em> greeting to the couple who arrived with me at the crossroad from the other side, and while the husband was looking into his Wainwright the wife set off towards Brown Pike. I had a quick look across the valley and could see dozens of people on the Old Man and this side, so I continued. As I hiked from Buck Pike to Dow Crag two dayhikers and their dog emerged from the south rake, a scramble I had intended to do but as it would have meant walking down and then scrambling up again, I decided to leave it for the time being. However, seeing those two emerge, elated, I was a bit disappointed that I did not have the time to do this fine scramble. </p>

<p>Dow Crag was busy with families eating a summit lunch (in T-shirts and shorts in the blazing wind, nonetheless), and so I continued. The Old Man of Consiton was still so busy, with plenty of people arriving and leaving. I took in the view from the summit cairn, and then decided it’s time to go on. After Swirl How it got eerily devoid of people, and I strolled on my own onwards to the Grey Friar. A fine summit with views on Crinkle Crags, Bow Fell, Sca Fell and Scafell Pike I sat down for some water, figs and dates, trying to make out the path to the valley. As I took off I followed a faint path, but soon I was walking on sheep trails down. I arrived in a muddy field amongst cows, between me and the street an insurmountable lake of wet cow dung. The cows looked on as I tried to avoid to step in their excrements, hoping from stone to a small green island of grass, but to no avail: As I reached the gate my shoes were covered in wet cow poop. At the road in Cockley Beck I sat down at the stream, tried to rinse and dry my socks, but the smell &amp; colour of cow poop was intending to stay. Barefoot, eating nuts, I observed an old couple who happily arrived back at their car. After they packed up they came over to offer me a ride up the pass - they must have seen that I intended to go that way - but I kindly said “No, thank you” and explained that I’d mess up their car with my wet &amp; dirty shoes. <em>“That’s no problem”</em> came the reply - an answer I least expected! I smiled and explained I prefer to walk, and thanked them again.</p>

<p>After allowing my socks and shoes to dry a bit I slipped them back on and started the hike up Hardknott Pass road. Cars passing me smiled, and with some satisfaction I reached the top of the pass, from where I had a fine view on the Eskdale valley. I absolutely adore these views: Lush green fields speckled with white and black sheep, green forests, a blue river which meanders through the valley and lovely houses. I passed by the Roman Fort and walked on the road till I saw the sign up to Sca Fell. A family just arrived from the top, and with the clock being almost 17 they looked curiously as I hiked on. Now my plan was ambitious and I hoped to camp up on Sca Fell or at the Fox Tarn, though after almost 28 km hiked I decided to camp lower, in the vicinity of water, at a lovely camp spot. </p>

<p>I pitched the TrailStar, boiled water for food, tea &amp; dessert, and looked as a big, yellow moon was slowly rising at Hardknott Pass while the last cars of the day made their way up the street. </p>

<p><br />
<br />The Snowspeeders landed at dusk on Hoth. Four UL conscripts, arriving from warm, sun-spoiled Tatooine to train in their fight against the heavyweight backpackers, embarked from the Snowspeeders, on their backs light packs, filled with the finest equipment to survive in the demading environment of Hoth. While the hanger crew took care of the Snowspeeders the conscripts walked over to the baracks, where beds and showers were waiting for them. As Commander Hesse walked in to inspect &amp; interview them, he found them sorting through their kit, full of questions for the coming training in the ice &amp; snow desert. How much insulation clothing would be needed, what is the weather forecast, where to deposit for not-needed gear during the exercise. Hesse answered their questions, and after the conscripts were done packing the group went to a local food parlour, where they discussed the plans for the coming exercise. Relaxed and full from good food, the group dispersed and retired to their beds, mentally prepared for what lay ahead.<br />
<br />
The next day the sun rose in the East, bathing Hoth in a warm glow. Last supplies were gathered by the group, before they and Commander Hesse boarded a transport ship which brought them to the outpost of Ruovesi. The weather was changing, from sunny to snowing and cloudy, but by the time the group disembarked from the transport ship the sun was dominating the sky. The five saddled their backpacks, with skis and snowshoes attached, and set out towards the end of the village. Ruovesi being a small outpost, the group soon walked on the prepared skiing track leading into the wild, and Commander Hesse put on his skis while conscript Fliegengewicht got his UL Pulka out and ready.&lt;/br&gt;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/6846902626/" title="1st kilometer done! by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7204/6846902626_81af6054dd_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="1st kilometer done!" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/6993030521/" title="Over a field by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7038/6993030521_827da832cc_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="Over a field" /></a></p>

<p><br />While the Commander skied ahead of the group, the four conscripts made good speed on the well frozen path, and the first few kilometers were quickly behind our group. The plan included following the skiing track for a while, until crossing over to a road and walk till the beginning of the training area. The conscripts put on their snowshoes to cross a field; without they sunk in until their thighs, with snowshoes only ankle to knee-deep. Hesse sped over the field, before taking his skis off and leading the way along the road till the training area was reached.<br /></p>

<p><br />A first small break was enjoyed, food and water was shared, before the group entered the forest and climbed up the ridge. While Hesse was leading on the open fields and forest, climbing the steep ridges with his skis was suboptimal and he fell behind the conscripts with their snowshoes, easily traversing the terrain. Once again down on the other side of the ridge however, Hesse was again leading the pack. With skeptical looks the conscripts observed how the Commander skied onto the lake, reassuring them that it was safe. Carefully, close to the shore, the conscripts set foot on the ice, thankful that it carried well and offering a vastly superior walking experience to the deep snow in the forests.<br /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/6993035723/" title="Over the lake, steep cliffs on each side by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7184/6993035723_d39ca65139_c.jpg" width="800" height="505" alt="Over the lake, steep cliffs on each side" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/6993041929/" title="In the shadows by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7181/6993041929_cf97ea210b_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="In the shadows" /></a></p>

<p><br />Strong winds opposed our little group, with wind speeds of over 15 m/s howling over the smooth, frozen lakes, transforming the mild temperatures of -2°C into body-numbing -22°C. Every possibility for a sheltered advance were taken, and breaks to snack and drink, to keep the energy up, kept the mood of the group high. So the two lakes were traversed without incidents and good speed was made, and the benefits of light gear became apparent.<br />
<br />
At the end of the lakes, the group followed a small stream to the higher up lake, where camp should be made. The low sun was making the shadows on Hoth long, and the temperature fell a little, though it was felt by our group, which by now started to get tired. This tiredness became apparent when two of the conscripts broke through the ice on the river, and got wet feet. Thus our group increased the speed, despite tiredness, and soon came to the end of the small stream, where they found open water flanked by cliffs on both sides blocking their advance. The conscripts had again an advantage in climbing up the steep ridge, while Commander Hesse took off his skis and climbed, knee-deep in the snow, the ridge up. Up on top, the sun had set in the west by now, basking the lakes and forests in a warm, orange glow while from east a deep blue crept over the horizon. How to proceed: Camp on top of this hill, or advance further down to the lake and the cooking shelter not far from here? The possibilities were discussed, and the shelter and fireplace swayed the group to press onward.<br /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/6993051101/" title="Abusing the cooking shelter as a sleeping shelter by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7204/6993051101_9282dda4aa_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="Abusing the cooking shelter as a sleeping shelter" /></a></p>

<p><br />After the descent the group followed the forest road to the cooking shelter, which was only a short walk away. Quickly fires were started, a Shangria-La 4 was used to close down one of the open sides, and sleeping places were claimed. After food and warm drinks were consumed, our little group stood under the starry sky, admiring Venus, Jupiter and the Milky Way, while faint Nordic Lights danced through the sky.<br /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/6993051489/" title="Fire by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7046/6993051489_05478b8d23_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="Fire" /></a></p>

<p><br />The next morning the sun returned in the east of Hoth, bathing it in its warm, bright light. Stoves were lit, and snow for the day ahead was melted, while quilts were hung up to air and packs made ready. The shadows of the forests became shorter as the sun rose over the lakes, and at the tenth hour of the day, after a small warm-up, our group left the cooking shelter and headed further north over the ice of the lake. They followed the tracks of a wolf, who traveled along the shore, while lynx and hare tracks crossed the lake. It didn’t take our group long to reach another camping site, and a decision to ski and walk to a nearby road was made.<br /></p>

<p><br />Passing by a farm, the group was surprised to see two Ostriches and a party of Wild Boars, animals not native to Hoth. They continued their walk down towards where a narrow path went off into the forest again, and weren’t stopped by fallen trees in their way. The sun continued to shine down on them, and by the time they arrived at the hut of Helvetinkolu, they were able to enjoy the warmth in only their baselayers outside.<br /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7108813079/" title="Hindernis by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7063/7108813079_87e4ee569a_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="Hindernis" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/6846937886/" title="Hut at Helvetinkolu by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7062/6846937886_a08907ae03_c.jpg" width="800" height="531" alt="Hut at Helvetinkolu" /></a></p>

<p><br />Inside discussions were held about how to proceed: Stay at this wonderful hut for the night and explore the surroundings, or move on towards a fine camping spot a half days travel from here. Looking at the distance to be covered in total, the group broke camp in the early noon, to traverse by map and compass the terrain between the hut and the lake, at whose shore their camping spot lay.<br /></p>

<p><br />Our group skied and snowshoed through forests, crossed swamps and climbed further steep ridges, and showed immense team spirit during the day. So was Commander Hesse skiing first over the swamp, encouraging the conscripts onwards, despite their sinking in to the knees in the snow; while the conscripts helped Hesse carry his skis when they climbed the ridges, in which Hesse sank in to his knees and further. Only because of this team work the group arrived after mere hours at the shore of the lake, which would take them to their camping spot.<br /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7108815593/" title="Over swamps by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7073/7108815593_95af83f2f9_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="Over swamps" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/6993063107/" title="Almost there by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7045/6993063107_8688d41dc7_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="Almost there" /></a></p>

<p><br />They pressed onwards, still under the warm glow of the sun, the light reflecting from the ice and snow on the lake, and reached in the early afternoon the camping spot. Again they decided to sleep in the cooking shelter, though Hesse insisted on them pitching their shelters on the lake for practice. And so three lightweight shelters sprung up on the ice, and the group inspected the different shelters: A LAUFBURSCHE Laavu, a LOCUS GEAR Khufu Sil and an GoLite Shangria-La 4. As quickly as they were pitched they disappeared again in their stuff sacks, and the group started to melt snow and prepare for the night.<br /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/6846969276/" title="Night sky by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7058/6846969276_8927a2c5a6_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="Night sky" /></a></p>

<p><br />Laughter and conversation started to erupt from the cooking shelter, while tasty meals were prepared and consumed and small bottles of fine beverages were passed around. As night fell, the sounds of owls sounded through the forest, and the greatness and magnificence of our galaxy, suspend over our heads, so clearly to be seen while standing on the lake, was evident. Somewhere out there, heavyweight backpackers under the the command of Darth Heavy planned for the destruction of lightweight. Little do they know that we are prepared, and that the force is strong in us.<br /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/6962819252/" title="Morning Glory by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7277/6962819252_e61b000117_c.jpg" width="800" height="237" alt="Morning Glory" /></a></p>

<p><br />At dawn Commander Hesse awoke, skinning himself out of his quilt and bivy to enjoy the fresh, cold morning air down on the lake. The sun was illuminating the trees on the opposite shore, while male Black Grouse were on the ice, their songs being heard far and wide. Today the group would train to navigate the forest roads to reach their destination of the night, a Laavu south of their current position. One of the conscripts joined Hesse on the lake, and when they walked back up to the shelter the others were already busy making breakfast and packing.<br /></p>

<p><br />The conscripts, in light of the terrain to be travelled across, opted to strap their snowshoes to their packs, while Commander Hesse preferred to ski on the ice and little snow of the forest roads. While this gave him a slight benefit in terms of speed, it was more a decision to not needing to carry the unwieldy skis and boots on his pack.<br /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/6993101299/" title="Splendid skiing conditions by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7038/6993101299_43d390d330_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="Splendid skiing conditions" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/6962818660/" title="Lunch break by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7224/6962818660_8f6bcaebdc_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Lunch break" /></a></p>

<p><br />The group made good speed on the forest roads, as lunchtime approached quickly. Here some differences became apparent: while the conscripts preferred to rely for energy on snacks throughout the day, Hesse liked a warm lunch in the cold weather, including melting snow for a warm cup of tea. So lunch breaks were a relaxed moment of interruption, to stretch muscles and talk. Once everyone was fed and ready, the group continued their journey south.<br /></p>

<p><br />After a while they left the well maintained forest roads and continued on the track of a snowmobil through the forest, passing by summer houses and hunting towers until they came upon the Pirkan-Taival trail, running from the Ruovesi Outpost to the Kuru Outpost. Along this trail lay their goal, the Kivikieringan Laavu, perched atop a small cliff, overlooking a tiny valley and the forest. The group split apart, with everyone walking and skiing at their own speed, and so Hesse and conscript Fliegengewicht were the first ones to arrive at the lean-to shelter. Conscript Fliegengewicht quickly gathered wood and started to split it for his fine wood stove, while slowly the rest of the group arrived.<br /></p>

<p><br />Sleeping places in the laavu were claimed, wood for the group fire carried from the wood shed, trails to the other buildings were established in the snow, and the benches around the hut were dug out. While it was still early, the blue sky had given way to a grey overcast heaven, with mist hanging in the air. So the group huddled around the fire, napped in their quilts and ate, until it was time to lay down for the night.<br /></p>

<p><br />On the morning of the fourth day of the exercise, Hesse would leave the group to return to the HQ, and to see if the group, now equipped with the skills and knowledge to navigate &amp; survive in the environment of Hoth, would be ready for the war. Snow for the day ahead was melted, while sleeping gear disappeared in backpacks, and coffee &amp; müslis were consumed. At nine in the morning, with heavy mist in the air, under a grey sky, Commander Hesse gave final instructions to the conscripts, and told them that he expects to seem them the next evening back at HQ. So the group parted ways - Hesse skied back to the Ruovesi Outpost, while the conscripts snowshoed onwards to the Outpost of Kuru.<br /></p>

<p><br />Commander Hesse skied like the wind, and after just 180 minutes entered the Outpost, 15 km from where he left the laavu in the morning. The personnel there was clearly surprised to see him so early, and needed some time to organize a transport ship for him back to Tampere. So he whiled away the time in the outpost, checking via satcom with the conscripts what the situation was like, and consumed coffee and cake till the transport ship finally landed. While he boarded the ship, he thought back with a smile to the past days, and that the force will be with the Ultralighters in the coming war.<br /></p>
