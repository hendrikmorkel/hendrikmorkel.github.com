    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Three times a charm, they say. My love affair with Åland went into the third round last week as I was photographing for <a href="http://www.norrmagazin.de">NORR</a> a story about cycling, bouldering and sea kayaking on the beautiful Åland Archipelago between Finland and Sweden. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28810987961/in/album-72157672041470976/" title="Cloudporn over the Baltic."><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8358/28810987961_443a331b7c_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1200" alt="Cloudporn over the Baltic." /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/02/aland-in-winter.html">The last time I was on Åland</a> was just in January, and how different it was back then: The roads under snow and ice, the Baltic partially frozen, a cold wind blowing. But it was also similar to the previous <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/11/bouldering-on-aland.html">bouldering trip to Åland</a> and this visit: The people were fantastic and made the trip even more memorable. Which made me realize once more: It’s more beautiful to share an outdoor adventure with friends. Sure it is nice to watch the sun set over the sea, but it is more fun to share that moment with a good friend. It’s cool if you topped out on your route, but it’s cooler if you have a friend to high-five with to celebrate that success. And while Sauna is always great, also on your own, it’s much better with friends who share your passion for a good <em>löyly</em>. So when you head out on your next outdoor adventure, take someone along: Your partner, kids, mate or someone who shares the same love for the outdoors than you do. I’m certain the trip will be more fun &amp; memorable for both of you =) </p>

<p>So much for advice, here’s a couple of B-Roll photos and one-liners to wet your appetite to head over to Åland with a bike and Crashpad on your back.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28810986921/in/album-72157672041470976/" title="On the way onto the ferry"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8701/28810986921_d281162f39_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1200" alt="On the way onto the ferry" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Kathrin from <a href="http://luminoucity.net">Luminoucity</a>, Kristof and me rolling onto the ferry by bike. My first time to roll on a bike onto a ferry, and a good one. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28810987461/in/album-72157672041470976/" title="Good Bye Helsinki"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8424/28810987461_9fe00bcb5c_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1200" alt="Good Bye Helsinki" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We said Good-By to Helsinki on the sun deck, sans sun.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28269451094/in/album-72157672041470976/" title="Morning cycling through along the fields"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7783/28269451094_8364170fbc_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Morning cycling through along the fields" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>At dawn we arrived on Åland and started to cycle up north to <a href="http://www.havsvidden.com">HavsVidden</a> past golden fields and a rising sun. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28810986491/in/album-72157672041470976/" title="Kristof at Kasviken"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7730/28810986491_0b29a9ae18_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1069" alt="Kristof at Kasviken" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We slipped in a session at Kasviken as it was so conveniently on the way. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28810986241/in/album-72157672041470976/" title="Relaxing at HavsVidden"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8846/28810986241_95f636f677_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1069" alt="Relaxing at HavsVidden" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>After that it was pretty chill at the beach house. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="http://amzn.to/2beNxGI" title="The Best We Can Do Is Nothing"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8160/28798090366_542e2ab604_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1069" alt="The Best We Can Do Is Nothing" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I read an <a href="http://amzn.to/2beNxGI">inspiring book</a> the next morning, which motivated me to do… nothing.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28798090286/in/album-72157672041470976/" title="Relaxing at Fågelberget"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8269/28798090286_a9f93a9c13_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1200" alt="Relaxing at Fågelberget" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>In between bouts of work I succeeded in following the books advice.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28855542636/in/album-72157672041470976/" title="Stallhagen Beers are tasty!"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8646/28855542636_ea16422b1f_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Stallhagen Beers are tasty!" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Then I failed pretty badly by cycling close to 46 km to go eat at <a href="http://www.stallhagen.com/en/?ageok=yes">Stallhagen</a>, and yes, drink some of their fantastic beers. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28855541356/in/album-72157672041470976/" title="Pelago Bicycles Capri"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8895/28855541356_f75340ee58_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Pelago Bicycles Capri" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>My friends were very happy with their <a href="https://www.pelagobicycles.com">Pelago Bicycles</a>, here the pretty <a href="https://www.pelagobicycles.com/bicycles/capri.html">Capri</a> which Vera rode.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28810989711/in/album-72157672041470976/" title="Portrait Sessions"><img src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8776/28810989711_fe8e83bd40_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Portrait Sessions" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I myself had my much loved <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/11/pelago-bicycles-stavanger.html">Stavanger</a> along, which performed flawlessly once again. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28810989151/in/album-72157672041470976/" title="On the way back to Mariehamn from Kobba Klintar"><img src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8695/28810989151_1951188c9e_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1200" alt="On the way back to Mariehamn from Kobba Klintar" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Jonas from <a href="http://www.paddelboden.com">The Paddle Shack</a> took us out to Kobba Klintar, the old pilot station which is really a great destination for a day of paddling. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28798090336/in/album-72157672041470976/" title="Seakayaking with Paddelboden"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8895/28798090336_ebc0d4057a_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1069" alt="Seakayaking with Paddelboden" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>On the way back we had back wind and choppy seas, so it was nice when we weaved back into the Archipelago and let ourselves just drift in the wind back towards the shack. Then it was just about cycling back to the ferry harbour and waiting for our big boat back to Helsinki. It was once again a fantastic visit and I can highly recommend you to spend a week or more on Åland if you’re into any of the above activities. By the way, you can read the complete story from Karen in NORR and see my good photos in the magazine in summer 2017 issue.

<h2 id="norr">NORR</h2>

<p>I have been writing for <a href="http://www.norrmagazin.de">NORR</a> on and off since five years and was really happy as they asked me to help them create the Special issue within the magazine on Finland. Not only has NORR some of the greatest design &amp; layout which you also will find in this issue, the stories in it too are always inspiring and fascinating. From a visit of Tove Jansson’s island to paddling the coast of Finland, there’s plenty in this magazine which will make Finland Lovers jump with excitement into the air! <a href="http://www.norrmagazin.de/einzelhefte/">Order your issue here</a> or be smart and <a href="http://www.norrmagazin.de/abonnement/">take out a subscription for a year</a>!</p>

<h2 id="outdoor-enthusiast">Outdoor Enthusiast</h2>

<p>It’s always great to be able to write for some UK publications, and I was really excited to write about <a href="http://www.oe-mag.co.uk/imag/oemarchapril2016/files/36.html">Via Ferratas</a> for the current Outdoor Enthusiast Magazine. It’s a free online Magazine and well worth checking out, with articles from trail running in North Pembrokeshire to thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail with my mate <a href="http://www.keithfoskett.com">Keith Foskett</a>.</p>

<h2 id="bike--travel">Bike &amp; Travel</h2>

<p>For the spring issue of the <a href="http://www.biketravel-magazin.com">Bike &amp; Travel Magazine</a> I wrote about alternative ways to carry your gear - with the great Micropanniers from <a href="http://www.porcelainrocket.com">Porcelain Rocket</a> and the <a href="http://ovejanegrathreadworks.com/index.html">Oveja Negra Threadworks</a> Frame Halfbags. Besides my contribution there’s tips on cycle-touring with kids, seven inspiring touring trip reports and some bikes have been tested, too. </p>

<h2 id="dein-finnland">Dein Finnland</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.dein-finnland.de/">Dein Finnland</a> is a new Magazine from Visit Finland and I was very happy to contribute a piece to the inaugral issue about my love for the coast of Finland. <a href="http://www.dein-finnland.de/kuestenleben-kuestenliebe/">Küstenleben - Küstenliebe</a> is the name of that piece, it’s free to read online and you should definitely keep an eye on this magazine, which has some beautiful stories in it!</p>
