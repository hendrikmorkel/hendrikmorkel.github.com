    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>If you have a rope, you should have a rope bag</em> was what I was told on my lead climbing course earlier this spring. There’s some good reasons for that: It’s easier to transport your rope plus it stays clean &amp; sorted at the crag. I settled for the <a href="http://www.dmmclimbing.com/">DMM</a> Classic Rope Bag, which holds a lot more than just a rope, and is very comfortable to carry.</p>

<p>I’m a sucker for <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/marken/dmm/?_artperpage=96">DMM</a>’s high quality gear, so it was an easy decision to get their <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/dmm-classic-rope-bag/">Classic Rope bag</a>. Being a Finnish climbing association member I even got a nice 10% discount on the bag as I bought it at <a href="http://camu.fi/pages/kiipeily/kalliokiipeily/kaysipussit/classicropebaggreen.html">Camu</a> down in Helsinki. You can choose from four nice colours, and I settled for the green one. </p>

<p>The Classic Rope Bag can be worn as a backpack or over the shoulder. It’s very easy to transform the backpack into a shoulder pack (or the other way around) - one of the shoulder straps has two buckles which you undo and then connect to the two matching buckles which keep the main compartment compressed. Lemme walk you through it:</p>

      <td>Backpack”&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>That’s the pack in backpack mode. The left shoulder strap, as you can see, has a buckle on top and at the bottom. </p>

<p>Buckles are easily opened. </p>

The closed top which helps to compress the content. </p>

<em>Magic</em>. Nah, not really. The shoulder strap is now connected to the buckle which you saw in the above photo.</p>

<p><em>“Why would I need a backpack that can become a shoulder bag?”</em> you might be wondering. Well, for a sport climbing day at the crag you can fit your rope, harness, shoes, a set of QDs and water in there, as well as a Topo Guide - all you need. Then you can wear it in backpack mode to the crag. </p>

<p>However, if you want to go Trad climbing, you will need a tad more gear - cams, nuts, torque nuts, which all takes more space. In that case you can either stuff all that gear in the DMM Classic Rope Bag, as I do, and transform it into the shoulder bag and take an additional backpack along for other stuff - water, sandwiches, camera gear - and then you can carry both without problems. Because it’s a lot more comfortable to carry a backpack and a shoulder bag instead of two backpacks.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9253426672/" title="DMM Classic Rope Bag by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7312/9253426672_513d0e3ceb_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="DMM Classic Rope Bag" /></a></p>

<p>The tarp is a good size - 110 x 130 cm - and has four colour coded loops so the rope(s) stay in order, even twin/ half-ropes. Speaking of ropes, the bag can take a 80 m rope without problems with room to spare. I have used my 70 m <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/kletterseile/">rope</a> and all my trad gear in there. The tarp (and backpack) has a 1000 mm hydrostatic head, so keeps moisture and wetness away from the rope when the ground is wet.</p>

<p>Once you have climbed enough (does that ever happen?) and it’s time to go, packing is easy with the Classic Rope Bag: Fold the tarp with rope together, stuff it neatly into the bottom of the pack, add all your other gear, close the durable zipper, pull the compression straps tight, and <em>Voilá</em>, you’re ready to hike back. It looks like this:</p>

Tarp with rope folded together.</p>

And in the bag.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/10208551665/" title="DMM Classic Rope Bag | Plenty of space by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8275/10208551665_5313b8dfc4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="DMM Classic Rope Bag | Plenty of space" /></a>
Add gear.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/10208558085/" title="DMM Classic Rope Bag | Holds a rope and a trad rack! by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7416/10208558085_a0b5cd59c7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="DMM Classic Rope Bag | Holds a rope and a trad rack!" /></a>
And more gear.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/10208676163/" title="DMM Classic Rope Bag | Closed by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3718/10208676163_ac1071daa6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="DMM Classic Rope Bag | Closed" /></a>
Close the zipper, pull the compression straps tight, go to the Pub and have a beer.</p>

<p>In case you don’t want to throw in your smartphone, keys and wallet in the main compartment, DMM has thought ahead and added a zippered valuables pocket. It will hold all your valuable and not so valuable stuff away from metal gear which might scratch it otherwise.</p>

<p>That’s it, really. There are plenty of <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/seiltaschen-seilpflege/">rope bags</a>, some are lighter, some are cheaper, sometimes you even can get a free one if you purchase a rope, but the durability, quality and ease of use of the DMM Classic Rope Bag are hard to beat. It comes at a good price, too. I’m really happy with it, and look forward to many years climbing with it. Two thumbs up.</p>

<p>You can buy one at <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/dmm-classic-rope-bag/">Bergfreunde</a>, <a href="http://camu.fi/pages/kiipeily/kalliokiipeily/kaysipussit/classicropebaggreen.html">Camu</a> and ask for it at <a href="http://bit.ly/Wi4tZS">Backcountry.com</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/131V0vk">CampSaver.com</a>. And now go climbing.</p>

<p><em>If you do a lot of Trad climbing, maybe consider waiting for the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/08/outdoor-news-iv.html">Vector trad pack</a>. It allows for easier trad gear organising!</em></p>
