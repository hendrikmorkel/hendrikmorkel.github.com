<p>With so many superb entries to the 1st Trip Report Contest I’ll be running a 2nd one.</p>

<p>Right now! </p>

<p><strong>BANG</strong>.</p>

<p><em>Thank you, thank you. Please sit down again and let me finish.</em></p>

<p><em>Yes, also you there can stop clapping now.</em></p>

<p>Thanks to the support of <a href="http://gossamergear.com/">Gossamer Gear</a>, you’ll be able to win their sweet <a href="http://gossamergear.com/packs/backpacks/kumo-superlight-backpack.html">Kumo</a> backpack, in your size, sent to you from Gossamer Gear directly. <a href="http://www.guthookhikes.com/2012/09/gossamer-gear-kumo-extended-use-review.html">Ryan</a> has a long-term review up on his blog, which will show you what this lightweight backpack is capable of.</p>

<p><em>Ok now, please let me finish.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8705758628/" title="Gossamer Gear Kumo by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8538/8705758628_d0e5f993ba_b.jpg" width="1000" height="1000" alt="Gossamer Gear Kumo" /></a>

<p>This wouldn’t be a Trip Report Contest if you wouldn’t need to go on a trip. You have till the 26th of May 2013 to head outdoors and then to <strong>write a Trip Report</strong> on your website/ blog/ or similar digital outlet. But that ain’t all. </p>

<p>As the Kumo is dedicated to the Japanese fans and friends of Gossamer Gear, you need to include an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku">俳句</a> in it. If you follow the traditional or modern Japanese haiku format is up to you in this case. It would be cool if you can make your haiku an executive summary of your trip, but for the poetically challenged we’ll also accept haikus which are just related to your trip =) But no haiku, no entry. </p>

<p>To enter, leave a comment with a link to your TR underneath (Please only submit ONE link, to ONE trip report). The TR should be from a 2013 hiking/ climbing/ backpacking/ packrafting/ mountaineering trip, and it can be a day hike, overnighter, weekender, expedition or thru-hike, and needs to be by fair means (so non-motorized). It can be text, video, photographs or a combination thereof. </p>

<p>In the week after the 26th of May there will be a post in which I nominate the three to five trip reports I like best, and then you - the awesome readers! - will have the final vote for the winner.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7175494629/" title="Wildflowers and mountains by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7103/7175494629_487b6bd8a8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Wildflowers and mountains" /></a></p>

<p><em>Oh, I almost forgot.</em></p>

<p>The winner of the first <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/04/trip-report-contest-finalists.html">Trip Report Contest</a> is, with 38,8% of the 129 votes given, Dr Jon and his <a href="http://drj0nswanderings.wordpress.com/2013/03/23/s24o-part-2/">S240</a> Trip Report. Congratulations! Please <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#104;&#101;&#110;&#100;&#114;&#105;&#107;&#064;&#104;&#105;&#107;&#105;&#110;&#103;&#105;&#110;&#102;&#105;&#110;&#108;&#097;&#110;&#100;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;">Email me</a> so I can get your address and send your price to you!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There were over two dozen entries for the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/03/trip-report-contest.html">trip report contest</a> and it was hard to narrow them down to the finalists. But here they are - six great adventures!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8631612299/" title="Morning by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8544/8631612299_ca3d6a0c76_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Morning" /></a></p>

<p>First: Thanks to all the participants. I enjoyed finding new websites and reading about all kind of adventures - from packrafting to bikepacking to winter hikes and skiing trips. There were videos, superb photos and great stories, and we spent a good deal of time to read them all and pick our favourites. So thank you to all who entered! </p>

<p>The following are the six trip reports which we liked best. They’re listed in no particular order, and you should read all six of them before casting your vote. They’re excellent stories of outdoor adventures, very nicely written and with great videos and photos. </p>

<p>Now that you’ve read them all, pick the ONE trip report which you liked best and vote for it [the voting tool might need a while to load, sorry. Please be patient =]:</p>

<p>Voting’s closed, winner will be announced soon.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8572851022/" title="Revelate Designs Sweet Roll handlebar bag by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8101/8572851022_e61fbe95eb_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Revelate Designs Sweet Roll handlebar bag" /></a></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Eric from <a href="http://www.revelatedesigns.com/">Revelate Designs</a> sent me an ultralight handlebar bag to give away to one lucky Hiking in Finland reader. It’s a one-of-its-kind, made of cuben, taped and is waterproof, too - and weighs a swell 169 gram. It fits any bike’s handlebars and offers plenty of storage - in the photos there’s a Katabatic Gear Sawatch quilt, a MSR Reactor 1.0 l stove &amp; pot and a 230 g gas canister in it with room to spare. It is based on the <a href="https://www.revelatedesigns.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=store.catalog&amp;CategoryID=3&amp;ProductID=25">Sweet Roll</a>, but is a bit lighter and isn’t black. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8571762199/" title="Revelate Designs Sweet Roll handlebar bag by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8365/8571762199_f95ebd3ff9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Revelate Designs Sweet Roll handlebar bag" /></a>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8572848108/" title="Revelate Designs Sweet Roll handlebar bag by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8087/8572848108_e496b33834_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Revelate Designs Sweet Roll handlebar bag" /></a>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8572844784/" title="Revelate Designs Sweet Roll handlebar bag by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8245/8572844784_236a303169_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Revelate Designs Sweet Roll handlebar bag" /></a></p>

<p>To win this sweet handlebar bag you need to <strong>write a Trip Report</strong> on your website/ blog/ or similar digital outlet, and leave a comment with a link to it underneath (Please only submit ONE link, to ONE trip report). It would be preferable that the trip report is from a recent trip (like, between now and the closing date - thus a superb reason to enjoy the outdoors!) and not a recycled 15 years old story (Though you can enter a trip report from 2013 =). It can be a day hike, overnighter, weekender, expedition or thru-hike, and should be by fair means (so on foot, skis, packraft or bicycle = non-motorized). It can be text, video, photographs or a combination thereof. </p>

<p>Closing date is the 10th of April 2013. Then there will be a post in which Eric and I nominate the three to five trip reports we like best, and the readers will have the final vote for the winner. We are looking forward to read your trip reports, so get out there!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We have winners! Many thanks again for the numerous submissions, it yet again was hard to choose the winners and honourable mentions - you are truely a very talented readership! </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8149921876/" title="Sunpillar by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8326/8149921876_a89106822e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Sunpillar" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/18839278@N00/8090625988/" title="Poll Doo Glen by flanagandave, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8184/8090625988_40a7c5b2f5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Poll Doo Glen" /></a></p>

<p>David takes the crown this time around. A very fine photo, a big, blazing fire and a beautiful sky and background. After a day of bouldering the three friends sit around the fire, while the starry sky is circling above them. While there is a lot of movement in the photo, I find this is part of the charm of it. All in all a very fine photo that interprets the topic of fire well, and adds a scent of adventure, friendship and nature to it. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/familyjonesnow/6137831658/" title="Forgewood Camping by The real Jonesnow, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6062/6137831658_2ba0bc2b13_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Forgewood Camping" /></a></p>

<p>Gareth submitted a very beautiful and touching image of his son taking in the fire. You can imagien how the little boy enjoys the warmth of the fire after a cold &amp; wet day, and just stars relaxed into the Wilderness TV channel. A beautiful, very emotional image that communicates warmth and security.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/walloftvs/7539459798/" title="Campfire, Mirror Lake, Spanish Peaks, Madison Range, Montana by samhDOTnet, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8292/7539459798_72411a9056_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Campfire, Mirror Lake, Spanish Peaks, Madison Range, Montana" /></a></p>

<p>Sam’s fianceé contemplates life at a campfire in the Madison Range. <em>Magnificent scenery</em> was my first thought. 
I like how the fire and person are just subtle parts of this photo, the mountains, snow and tree tops grab a lot of attention, and I can imagine how a fire in such a setting is like a beacon of warmth and “civilization”.</p>

<p><em>All three of you, please contact me <a href="hendrik.morkel@gmai.com">via email</a>. Each of you wins an awesome Light-My-Fire Swedish FireKnife!</em></p>

<h2 id="honourable-mentions">Honourable Mentions</h2>

<p>Kermiitti’s dog, who’s sleeping peacefully by the fire. An emotional and peaceful photo.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/88697876@N02/8092393902/" title="Fire by christophersussman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8326/8092393902_9cbdd58f30_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Fire" /></a></p>

<p>Christopher and his wife thru-hiked the PCT this year, and this was the fire they made on the 2nd last day on the trail. A fine way to celebrate a great achievement!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/61712293@N03/7289352196/" title="Aufwärmen am Feuer"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7100/7289352196_8e4d99a0f2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="575" alt="Aufwärmen am Feuer" /></a></p>

<p>Beni and Anatol warming up by the fire on a trip in the Alps earlier this year. Contemplating, warming up, while in the background you can see hints of the scenery.</p>

<hr />

<p>Again, a big THANK YOU to all participants. It was a great pleasure to go through all the different, creative and beautiful photos &amp; stories which were entered, and it was a tough job to pick the three I liked the most. Later this month the 3rd round of this photography contest will come around, so keep your cameras ready!</p>

<p><em>All rights to the shown photos are with their respective owners. Thank you for allowing me to showcase them.</em></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2012/08/1st-hif-reader-photo-contest.html">1st Hiking in Finland Reader Photo Contest</a> was a <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2012/08/hif-photo-contest-winners.html">great success</a>, and many awesome photos were submitted. Now were back with a burning desire to see more splendid photos - and win some fiery gear, too!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/6993051489/" title="Fire by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7046/6993051489_05478b8d23_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Fire" /></a></p>

<p>Nothing says outdoors and backpacking like a warm fire. It gives you light, warmth and allows you to cook. It’s a gathering place to sit around in the evenings after a day of skiing or backpacking, and its glow in the distance means there’s a warm place to go to. I love a good fire in the evenings at camp, and I love to take photos of the burning wood and flames. So for this contest I’d like to see your interpretation of FIRE. Is it a camping fire? A forest fire? Flames? A BushBuddy? Whatever it is, the topic is wide open to interpretation and I hope for many creative submissions. </p>

<p>How to participate:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Leave a comment with a link to your [one] photo on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> and tag the photo with “<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/hifirecontest/">HIFireContest</a>” so that it’s easy to find, and tell us a bit about the story behind the photo.</li>
  <li>Deadline is the 30th of October, 2012, Midnight Finnish time.</li>
  <li>I will pick the top three photos and award a price to the winner and runner-ups.</li>
</ol>

<p>The Price? The top three each get a <a href="http://www.lightmyfire.com/products/sparking-fire-collection/swedish-fireknife.aspx">Swedish FireKnife</a>, courtesy of <a href="http://www.lightmyfire.com/">Light-My-Fire</a>. A super-sharp Mora knife, paired with a Light-My-Fire FireSteel and coming in a bunch of great colours, this is a light (109 gram) and useful tool to carry when going outdoors.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8080007017/" title="IMG_0112 by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8184/8080007017_a08ab8fa00_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="IMG_0112" /></a></p>

<p>So that’s it. I’m looking forward to seeing your photos. Happy photographing - and don’t burn yourself!</p>

<p><strong>Why Flickr?</strong> Because it is easy for me and others to see all entries in one go. You can sign up for free in case you don’t have an account yet.<br />
<strong>Will you showcase the winner’s photo?</strong> I sure hope so! So please allow others to embed your photo. You keep all rights to your photo, and it will be shown one time on Hiking in Finland. With participating you thus grant me permission to embed your photo <em>one time</em> here, for free. </p>
