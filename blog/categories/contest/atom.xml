<p>Eric from <a href="http://www.revelatedesigns.com/">Revelate Designs</a> sent me an ultralight handlebar bag to give away to one lucky Hiking in Finland reader. It’s a one-of-its-kind, made of cuben, taped and is waterproof, too - and weighs a swell 169 gram. It fits any bike’s handlebars and offers plenty of storage - in the photos there’s a Katabatic Gear Sawatch quilt, a MSR Reactor 1.0 l stove &amp; pot and a 230 g gas canister in it with room to spare. It is based on the <a href="https://www.revelatedesigns.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=store.catalog&amp;CategoryID=3&amp;ProductID=25">Sweet Roll</a>, but is a bit lighter and isn’t black. </p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8572848108/" title="Revelate Designs Sweet Roll handlebar bag by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8087/8572848108_e496b33834_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Revelate Designs Sweet Roll handlebar bag" /></a>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8572844784/" title="Revelate Designs Sweet Roll handlebar bag by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8245/8572844784_236a303169_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Revelate Designs Sweet Roll handlebar bag" /></a></p>

<p>To win this sweet handlebar bag you need to <strong>write a Trip Report</strong> on your website/ blog/ or similar digital outlet, and leave a comment with a link to it underneath (Please only submit ONE link, to ONE trip report). It would be preferable that the trip report is from a recent trip (like, between now and the closing date - thus a superb reason to enjoy the outdoors!) and not a recycled 15 years old story (Though you can enter a trip report from 2013 =). It can be a day hike, overnighter, weekender, expedition or thru-hike, and should be by fair means (so on foot, skis, packraft or bicycle = non-motorized). It can be text, video, photographs or a combination thereof. </p>

<p>Closing date is the 10th of April 2013. Then there will be a post in which Eric and I nominate the three to five trip reports we like best, and the readers will have the final vote for the winner. We are looking forward to read your trip reports, so get out there!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2012/08/1st-hif-reader-photo-contest.html">1st Hiking in Finland Reader Photo Contest</a> was a <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2012/08/hif-photo-contest-winners.html">great success</a>, and many awesome photos were submitted. Now were back with a burning desire to see more splendid photos - and win some fiery gear, too!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/6993051489/" title="Fire by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7046/6993051489_05478b8d23_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Fire" /></a></p>

<p>Nothing says outdoors and backpacking like a warm fire. It gives you light, warmth and allows you to cook. It’s a gathering place to sit around in the evenings after a day of skiing or backpacking, and its glow in the distance means there’s a warm place to go to. I love a good fire in the evenings at camp, and I love to take photos of the burning wood and flames. So for this contest I’d like to see your interpretation of FIRE. Is it a camping fire? A forest fire? Flames? A BushBuddy? Whatever it is, the topic is wide open to interpretation and I hope for many creative submissions. </p>

<p>How to participate:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Leave a comment with a link to your [one] photo on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> and tag the photo with “<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/hifirecontest/">HIFireContest</a>” so that it’s easy to find, and tell us a bit about the story behind the photo.</li>
  <li>Deadline is the 30th of October, 2012, Midnight Finnish time.</li>
  <li>I will pick the top three photos and award a price to the winner and runner-ups.</li>
</ol>

<p>The Price? The top three each get a <a href="http://www.lightmyfire.com/products/sparking-fire-collection/swedish-fireknife.aspx">Swedish FireKnife</a>, courtesy of <a href="http://www.lightmyfire.com/">Light-My-Fire</a>. A super-sharp Mora knife, paired with a Light-My-Fire FireSteel and coming in a bunch of great colours, this is a light (109 gram) and useful tool to carry when going outdoors.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8080007017/" title="IMG_0112 by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8184/8080007017_a08ab8fa00_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="IMG_0112" /></a></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thank you everyone who participated in the first <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2012/08/1st-hif-reader-photo-contest.html">Hiking in Finland Photo Contest</a>. There were well over 30 entries, and it was hard to narrow it down three, let alone pick a winner.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7751534778/" title="Magic forest by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8448/7751534778_8cb0b606cd_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Magic forest" /></a></p>

<p>Picking the top three was hard, I sat for well over fourty minutes looking at all the entries, discussing them with my wife (always have female input in important decisions!), until I finally was able to settle on the winning three.</p>

<h2 id="place-1">Place 1:</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/84534588@N03/7799962514/" title="Teufelsslucht by Samen Buiten, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8285/7799962514_8e8b5b1b42_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Teufelsslucht" /></a></p>

<p><em>It is a very interesting view of a broad-leaved forest in Luxembourg, with cliffs to one side. The brown, dead leaves on the floor stand in nice contrast with the bright green leaves of the trees, as does the dead wood on the ground with the living trees. The rocks on the right side are a stark contrast to the living matter around them, funnily enough one of the rocks looks like a skull. The photo appears to be not manipulated [missing EXIF data :/]. All in all a very nice scene, one where I feel like jumping in and going for a hike and climb. However, I think the photo could have been improved by not having been taken in the middle of the day - morning or evening light could have improved the photo. Nevertheless, my favourite of the submitted photos. Congratulations Samen Buiten!</em></p>

<h2 id="place-2">Place 2:</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/familyjonesnow/4419539761/" title="Honeymoon - Kamikochi, Japan by The real Jonesnow, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4040/4419539761_9863957f49_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Honeymoon - Kamikochi, Japan" /></a></p>

<p><em>In this photo I really like the perspective it gives - the person in the photo gives you a sense of the surroundings. The infalling sunbeams from the right give the impression of it being very early, which is further enhanced by the rising mist and the clouds in the sky. Broad-leaf trees in the foreground till close to the river, with some conifers on the side and the mountains shows how different and adaptable the forest can be. I really feel how the moisture is in the air in this photo, how the leafs and stones are covered in dew and can imagine how nice it must be to walk there, waiting for the sun to come over the tree tops. Maybe the sky is slightly overlighted, though all in all a very great photo, and a worthy second place! Congratulations Gareth!</em></p>

<h2 id="place-3">Place 3:</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/74188980@N08/6942323674/" title="IMGP8848 by Tanglefist, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5336/6942323674_ff751190d8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="685" alt="IMGP8848" /></a></p>

<p><em>A very nice capture, illustrating that forests not only can be a relaxing, serene place, but also invite us to enjoy adrenaline-laden activities like mountain biking in them. The fuzzy, brown conifer forest with a bit of green shining through in the background are a nice contrast to the sharp mountain biker in the centre. Taking photos like these isn’t easy, especially as this one was shot in a moment as it presented itself; though it would have been nice if the mountain biker would have been really crisp and sharp. Here I feel like I’d like to join the two mountain bikers and race over the trails in the shadow of the forest. Congratulations Court Harding!</em></p>

<p>Please all three of you of you contact me via Email. The first place gets the Berghaus Arete Backpack, while I have a small surprise for the second and third place.</p>

<h2 id="honourable-mentions">Honourable Mentions:</h2>

<p>Picking three out from the 30+ entries was hard, and so I show you the three more photos which were in the top six: </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/67976808@N06/7775627836/" title="Birchy by valppaus, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8284/7775627836_c0a34f32a1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="685" alt="Birchy" /></a></p>

<p><em>Joni from Finland photographed the prettiest tree of Finland - the Birch. I like the texture in the photo, and the autumny look.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/84698967@N04/7804463118/" title="DSC00911 by Levonjensen, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8441/7804463118_0c2de4c494_b.jpg" width="680" height="1024" alt="DSC00911" /></a></p>

<p><em>Levon Jensen presents us with a classic autumn view from Waterton Park. Great autumn colours and the mountains and clouds in the background make for a majestic scenery.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sticksblog/7756590274/" title="P1030316 by Sticks Blog, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8445/7756590274_259b61e1c4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="P1030316" /></a></p>

<p><em>Chad Poindexter’s forest path in the mist is a very beautiful photograph, which makes you feel like you want to walk down that path towards the light.</em></p>

<p>Again, a big THANK YOU to all participants. It was a great pleasure to go through all the different, creative and beautiful photos which were entered, and a tough job to pick the three I liked the most. Once September comes by, expect a second photography contest!</p>

<p><em>All rights to the shown photos are with their respective owners. Thanks for allowing me to showcase them.</em></p>
