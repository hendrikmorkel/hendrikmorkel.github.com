<p>Winter here in Finland is almost over now, and I decided to take my <a href="https://www.panamajackshop.com/woman/footwear/bambina-igloo-b2">Panama Jack Bambina Igloo Boots</a> for their last stroll in the nature before packing them up for the next winters to come. I believe we will be having many good years together - after all, the first Panama Jacks I bought in Spain 5 years ago are still as good as new.</p>

<p>These Spaniards are born to cold climates, icy roads and cold breezes. This winter was particularly short, but we had the chance to experience up to - 20 degrees together. My feet were perfectly warm, assuming that I was mostly on the move while being outside and I wore thin, wool socks. Special thanks to the rubber outsoles that kept me on my feet also when walking on plain ice - where other boots’ sole behave like ice skates, these had a solid grip.</p>

<p>The leather in both pairs of Panama Jack shoes I have is especially hard wearing, and the shoes are durable and carefully crafted. They’re also extremely comfortable to wear, and look good in the city and on day hikes alike. I am looking forward to seeing this pair again in November 2014!</p>
