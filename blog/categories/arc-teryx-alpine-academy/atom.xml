<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18863780819" title="&quot;And over there...&quot; by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/518/18863780819_3527250da3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="&quot;And over there...&quot;" /></a></p>

<p>2015 was the 4th <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/07/arcteryx-alpine-academy-2014.html">Arc’teryx Alpine Academy</a> overall and my second one to attend. I was lucky enough to be invited as a member of the Press this year so got a sneak peak at the cool new gear that will come next year from Arc’teryx, and like everyone got the chance to hang out with the athletes, try out cool gear from Arc’teryx, Petzl, Scarpa, MSR and LYO Food and have a great time in Chamonix with the other participants. Here’s a re-cap of the three clinics I visited, which should be interesting if you’re considering to visit the Arc’teryx Academy in 2016!</p>

<h2 id="glacier-preparation-clinic">Glacier Preparation Clinic</h2>

<p>I haven’t been to Mer de Glace last year so decided that the <a href="http://chamonix.arcteryxacademy.com/shop/a-beginners/clinic-03-glacier-preparation-clinic/">Glacier Preparation Clinic</a> would be a good start for the weekend in Chamonix. The Mer de Glace is also only at about 1.900 m height which makes for easier acclimatisation, which worked well for me - last year I went straight up to 3.800 m, and living at sea level that’s quite a bit of difference. </p>

<p>Our group of four were with BMG and IFMGA Mountain Guide <a href="http://stuartmacdonald.org/">Stuart MacDonald</a> which was a great guy which explained us everything we needed to know about walking on a Glacier. After taking the train up to the Grand Hotel Du Montevers we walked to the ladders and started the descent down to the Glacier. It’s an interesting thing, as less than 150 years ago you could walk onto the Glacier from where you embark the train - climate change is showing its ugly face here, and it will be interesting to see how much more the glacier will retreat.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19046370865" title="Grand Hotel Montevers Hotel by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/474/19046370865_4085701c4a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Grand Hotel Montevers Hotel" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18861943339" title="Down the ladders by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/432/18861943339_3cebe64d02_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Down the ladders" /></a>

<p>Once you’re down the ladders you walk over the moraine till you’re at the proper glacier. Here Stuart explained us how to put on our crampons and how to walk normally in them, which we did for a bit. Then we moved on to learn more crampon techniques, front pointing, and how to use our ice axe. If you haven’t used these ever before its a good clinic to get to know the basics, so that you can do for example glacier hikes in the future.</p>

<p>After that we went to a steep section where a glacial river has carved a deep gorge into the ice, set up anchors and started to first walk steep ice up, and then ice climb it. The latter exercise was great fun, as we went from two ice tools to one ice tool to no ice tool, which taught you about proper foot placement and keeping your balance. This was the most fun part for me and I could have done it all afternoon long. Alas, we wanted to catch the 15 o’clock train down so after everyone made a lap down and up we started the walk back to the train station. </p>

<h2 id="advanced-alpine-techniques">Advanced Alpine Techniques</h2>

<p>The Arête des Cosmiques has been on my Tick List for a long time, and I was a bit jealous when my mate did it last year in his Technical Mountaineering course while we did the Pointes Lachenal Traverse. Waking up on Saturday morning after maybe one Génépi too much I was sure that today I’d be going on the Cosmiques, and lo and behold: As I arrived punctually at the Aiguille du Midi base station <a href="http://www.chamonix-guides.eu/Trombinoscope/251/contact/jean_villard_guides/23-trombinoscope.htm">Jean Villard</a> told me with a smile that the weather is so good that he thinks we should do the Cosmiques today, because we can learn &amp; practice all the techniques on it that we should do in our <a href="http://chamonix.arcteryxacademy.com/shop/c-advanced/clinic-06-sat-adv-tech-alpinism/">Advanced Alpine Techniques clinic</a>. We drove up in the first Gondola and met the two other clients who slept the night up on the glacier, roped up and started the approach to the Arête des Cosmiques. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19053159461" title="The start of the Arête des Cosmiques by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/421/19053159461_dfe9b0da84_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="The start of the Arête des Cosmiques" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19049953765" title="Jean Villard preparing the rope by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/559/19049953765_bf34d4de11_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Jean Villard preparing the rope" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19044428282" title="Blue-Bird weather by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/476/19044428282_6f2375c22a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Blue-Bird weather" /></a></p>

<p>At the Abri Simond hut we untied, roped up again and started up the route. It starts off with easy snow &amp; ice covered slabs which we protected with an occasional friend. At the Gendarme then came the first abseil, which had me a bit nervous - wrongly, though. Then it are a few more steps to the 2nd abseil, where you need to squeeze yourself backwards through a narrow chimney, which again was somehow feeling a bit dodgy to me, but again was no problem. After that followed some easy traversing to the 2nd tower, where we passed the <a href="http://www.chamonixtopo.com/digital-crack-aiguille-du-midi">Digital Crack</a>, the highest 8a in Europe. It looked like a beautiful line and should I ever reach that level, I’m sure to try it. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19023712866" title="Scrambling by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/520/19023712866_9dcd627ea1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Scrambling" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19053150951" title="1st Rappel by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/400/19053150951_91b1417a73_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="1st Rappel" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18427455014" title="2nd Rappel by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3931/18427455014_fb2865d367_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="2nd Rappel" /></a>

<p>But our climbing, at a much lower grade, was coming: The 4a Crux pitch. Jean free soloed it up without problems - he probably does that route a dozen times per year, and he’s already very long a Mountain Guide! - and then we followed. It was very easy even with crampons on, so even if you’re not a climber this shouldn’t have you worried in my opinion. As we were the first rope team on the route that day and we lost our pursuers after the first rappel we had a leisurely lunch on top of the Crux pitch, enjoyed the Alpine Choughs which were sailing above us and the beautiful sunshine. </p>

<p>After the nice break we continued onto the North Face of the route, and it got a wee bit colder in the shadow. But the scrambling over large boulders and through chimneys kept us warm enough until we reached the final plateau before the Aiguille du Midi cable car station. I had Georg, Johannes and Jean walk up to a pillar to take a few photos, and the people on the view platform went completely mad =) As we climbed the wee ladder up we were welcomed like celebrities and had our photos taken with strangers!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19053168201" title="&quot;And then you swing your leg over it like this!&quot; by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/391/19053168201_dd50af4a14_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="&quot;And then you swing your leg over it like this!&quot;" /></a>

<p>It was a four hour round trip for us four (three clients, one Guide) with one long break for lunch, if you go alone or just two you probably can do it in a couple of hours or less - when there’s not a lot of people on the route, as it is very popular! It definitely is worth a visit, as it is a very scenic route that’s great to practice alpine climbing and mountaineering skills.</p>

<h2 id="bigwall-climbing">Bigwall Climbing</h2>

<p>Sunday and <a href="http://chamonix.arcteryxacademy.com/shop/c-advanced/clinic-19-sun-big-wall-climbing/">Bigwall Climbing</a> was a great combination. The Bigwall Climbing clinic was new this year and very popular, and I think for a good reason: With a Client to Athlete to Guide Ratio of 3:1:1 it’s a fantastic clinic to learn new skills, ask a lot of questions and practice a lot. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18863698930" title="On the way to the Gongola by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/562/18863698930_34a87765fc_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="On the way to the Gongola" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19025173796" title="Bigwall Clinic group by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3746/19025173796_f7399d1035_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Bigwall Clinic group" /></a></p>

<p>The Bigwall Climbing consisted of four stations: The Portaledge Station, Jumaring, and two Aid Climbing stations - one with friends and nuts, the other with pitons and skyhooks. Because of time constraints I only got to try the first three, but on the plus side I was able to practice how to ascend the rope with some of my own gear (<a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/wild-country-ropeman-mk2f-steigklemme/">Ropeman 2</a> + <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/petzl-micro-traxion-seilrolle/?pid=81">Micro Traxion</a> in case you’re wondering). <a href="https://www.facebook.com/marcandreclimb">Marc-André Leclerc</a> showed us how to jumar the traditional way, with two <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.co.uk/petzl-ascension-ascender/">Jumars</a> and <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.co.uk/black-diamond-alpine-aiders-ladder/">Aider Ladders</a>. It was interesting to try this, as it always looks so easy in movies, but until you have found out the rhythm it wasn’t as easy as it looks!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18428873064" title="Marc-André explaining how to jumar by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3777/18428873064_d2a06da4f9_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Marc-André explaining how to jumar" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19025176476" title="Me jumaring by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/366/19025176476_7e9f1d6c4c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Me jumaring" /></a>

<p>After that <a href="http://arcteryx.com/Athlete.aspx?EN/PaulMcSorley">Paul McSorley</a> showed us how to set up a Portaledge Camp, keep the camp in order and haul gear up. It was super interesting and as Paul has slept a few nights in Portaledges it was cool to hear his stories and tips on how to camp comfortably on a Bigwall. Sleeping on a Portaledge in Yosemite is high on my list, and this clinic certainly has me psyched to make that dream come true some day soon.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18865219979" title="&quot;And that&#x27;s how you keep things tidy&quot; by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/316/18865219979_96ac17bd8d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="&quot;And that&#x27;s how you keep things tidy&quot;" /></a>

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18428878174" title="Knot Protector™ by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/495/18428878174_8b0b55d11e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Knot Protector™" /></a>

<p>And then we went Aid Climbing. <a href="http://www.bigwall.ch/">Pesche Wüthrich</a> explained Hayden and me the ins and outs, and then we both scaled the crack on aid. Slowly. Because Aid Climbing, we learned, needs a lot of time. You place gear, clip in the ladder and Daisy Chain, slowly weigh it to see if it holds, then clip in your Fiffi hook, and repeat. The route we climbed was a super easy crack which we probably could have climbed half a dozen times without Aid gear on lead, but this was a cool way to try it out and learn about it. The beauty/ attractiveness of it is certainly that you can climb safely on your own.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>I arrived Thursday morning and left Sunday afternoon, but happily would have stayed a bit longer in this fine Alpine Climbing &amp; Mountaineering Playground. My 2nd Arc’teryx Alpine Academy was again a lot of fun &amp; very inspirational, where I met great people, learned new skills, and got to climb in Europe’s best alpine climbing destination. What made me very happy was that there were a lot of people from all skill levels who decided to come to the <a href="https://instagram.com/explore/tags/arcteryxacademy/">#ArcteryxAcademy</a> to learn mountaineering and climbing skills. I shared the rope with hillwalkers from the UK &amp; Malaysia, aspiring mountaineers from Austria and Bigwall Climbers from the USA, Canada and France, and met old friends from across the globe. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19045840552" title="Hiking into the fog by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3818/19045840552_36c47c9f90_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Hiking into the fog" /></a></p>

<p>Again I can only recommend aspiring mountaineers and alpinists as well as backpackers &amp; hikers who’d like to up their skills to visit the <a href="http://chamonix.arcteryxacademy.com/">Arc’teryx Alpine Academy</a>. This year there were less people which in my opinion improved the learning and safety on the mountains, and made the groups more cozy &amp; personal, with more time for asking questions and trying techniques. The price-to-quality ratio still is superb, and if you consider all the free stuff available - the <a href="http://chamonix.arcteryxacademy.com/movie-night/">Movie Night</a>, the interesting <a href="http://chamonix.arcteryxacademy.com/seminar-night/">Seminars</a> and the <a href="http://chamonix.arcteryxacademy.com/demo-gear/">Demo Gear</a> - it really is very affordable. I certainly will keep a weekend free for next year for the 5th Arc’teryx Alpine Academy - if you’re smart, you’ll too! </p>

<p>I wrote in detail about the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/07/arcteryx-alpine-academy-2014.html">2014 Arc’teryx Alpine Academy</a> and just booked my flights for this year’s event. If you want to learn about mountaineering, alpine climbing and the skills needed to safely cross a glacier on a hike, then you should right now surf to the <a href="http://arcteryxacademy.com">Arc’teryx Alpine Academy website</a> as registration for the clinics opens today. Here’s the teaser to get you in the mood:</p>

<iframe width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ERdkz2ga_6s" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>As in 2014 the ‘Compagnie des Guides de Chamonix’, the ‘British Mountain Guides’ (BMG) and the Chamex Guides together with Arc’teryx Athletes like Ines Papert, Luka Lindic, Nina Caprez and Mina Leslie-Wujastyk will teach you the skills and know-how to enjoy the mountains. New this year is the Clean-Up-Day on Thursday, the 11th of June, where the athletes and participants clean the mountains from rubbish. I’ll be there for that occasion, and can highly recommend you are too so you can get acclimatized before you head up to the Aiguille du Midi =) </p>

<p>You can read about the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/07/arcteryx-alpine-academy-2014.html">logistics of getting and staying there</a> in my article from last year, and check out the <a href="http://arcteryxacademy.com/shop/">2015 Clinics</a> now so you know what to book. I have no doubt that the most popular courses will be fully-booked in a matter of minutes, so act quickly!

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>“Want to go to Chamonix to the Arc’teryx Alpine Academy?”</em> I messaged <a href="http://www.vincentkleine.com/">Vincent</a>. </p>

<p><em>“Sure”</em>  came the reply. </p>

<p>And so we went.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14710726426" title="Rope Team Tacul by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2913/14710726426_e6150f2ff3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Rope Team Tacul" /></a></p>

<p>It was the 3rd year for the <a href="http://arcteryxacademy.com/">Arc’teryx Alpine Academy</a> in 2014, and I finally managed to attend after I couldn’t go in 2012 and 2013. And I was very happy that my friend Vincent from Hamburg, a very talented <a href="http://www.vincentkleine.com/">outdoor photographer</a>, came along. Sharing these kind of adventures is always nice, even if there’s no lack of like-minded people at the event so going on your own is no problem. This year there were about 400 budding alpinists taking part in the clinics, which ran from Friday to Sunday with plenty of surrounding programme down in the valley. I was in Chamonix, the alpine capital of the world where hardcore alpine climbs are so easy to reach thanks to the teleferic. </p>

<p>I picked three clinics from the 18 different ones on offer: Technical Mountaineering 1 &amp; 2 and Alpine Climbing. Attentive readers likely have seen my love for climbing &amp; mountaineering develop in the past years and I wanted to use the opportunity to learn from some top UIAGM Guides before some more trips to the mountains this year. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14264400488" title="It&#x27;s gonna be a bright, sun-shiny day by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3910/14264400488_981fdc035b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="It&#x27;s gonna be a bright, sun-shiny day" /></a></p>

<p>Our Guide in the Technical Mountaineering 1 clinic was <a href="http://allmountains.pl/">Maciej Ciesielski</a> from Poland, an UIAGM Guide and Arc’teryx athlete. It was a good introduction clinic and we learned about short roping, walking as a rope team, building a crevasse rescue anchor and more. We pondered around on the Valle Blanché glacier and did our exercises there and time flew as we went back up to the Aiguille Du Midi just as the afternoon thunderstorms started to arrive.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14449871894" title="Up into the clouds by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3857/14449871894_ba7155652d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Up into the clouds" /></a></p>

<p>Friday evening was Seminar night and I visited the Alexandre Buisse &amp; <a href="https://peakdesignltd.com/store/capturepro?coupon_code=hikeinfin">Peak Designs</a> clinic which was OK, didn’t learn too much new info but it was good to refresh the existing knowledge. Next was a session with two Arc’teryx employees about dressing right for the mountains, which was pretty good. Materials and different garments were discussed, and one had the option to check out a garment’s warmth performance with a heat camera. And thirdly was a clinic with <a href="http://www.outdoorfoodshop.de/marken/lyofood-expedition/index.php#.U9IZmoCSwtw">LYO Food</a> and Ines Papert. I had the luck to sit next to Ines and so we chatted a bit, which was pretty cool. The LYO presentation itself was the best of the evening, too - good infos delivered in a humours way that got everyone laughing.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14784519783" title="Heatgun by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3847/14784519783_f6aee8fa98_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Heatgun" /></a></p>

<p>On Saturday I was in the Technical Mountaineering 2 clinic which was superb. <a href="http://www.steve-hartland.com/">Steve Hartland</a>, a British Mountain Guide, did an outstanding job with our group of six on the Pointes Lachenal Traverse. After inquiring about our experience and expectations we headed up to the Aiguille Du Midi, where we roped up and walked the snow arête down. Here we separated in three rope teams and I had the good fortune to rope up with James, an experienced mountaineer from the UK. We walked across the Valle Blanché glacier and the made our way up to the start of the Pointes Lachenal Traverse, which started with an easy climb on snow and ice. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14547100848" title="Glacier approach by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5591/14547100848_921e284808_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Glacier approach" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14730555501" title="Halo by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5558/14730555501_4fcc6284f7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Halo" /></a>

<p>On top Steve explained about running belays and proper rope technique and then I set off leading the group. We had a short rock section which we traversed with running belays, a quick rappel, a bit of mixed climb with running belays and then walked across a col. Here we had the option of an easy rock climb or to go around and climb the snow &amp; rock slope. We opted for the latter because we were running out of time, and James and me again led the way, placing a couple of pieces of protection along the way. We made it to the top, just underneath the real summit, where we had a quick hydration &amp; snack break waiting for the rest to make their way up. </p>

<p>Once everyone was up it was time to go down - the weather already started to turn and we still needed to cross the glacier and get up to the station. So walked down across the snow slope, jumped over a Bergschrund and walked back in the <em>alpine trot</em>. At the start of the snow arête up to the station James and I shortened the rope as the first lightnings started flashing and loud thunder was engulfing us. Standing on a snow arête is a rather inconvenient place to enjoy the beauty of a thunderstorm, so we quickly made our way up to the base station.</p>

<p>Safely back in the ice cave we were happy that we made it and had such a fine day. Steve debriefed us and then we headed down to Chamonix. I walked back to the B&amp;B, had a nice cool shower and then slipped into some less warm clothes before heading back to the base station, where the Arc’teryx Mountain Dinner started. Vincent and me sat down with some friends, heard their stories about their days and enjoyed the good food. As we were slightly tired we went back to the B&amp;B and so missed out on the Alpine Movie Night, which we heard was a good success. </p>

<p>Sunday was the last day of the event, and it seemed there were less people around than the previous days. In my Alpine Climbing clinic I was with <a href="http://northernmountainsport.co.uk/">Tim Blakemore</a>, a BMC &amp; UIAGM Guide, <a href="http://arcteryx.com/Athlete.aspx?EN/JvanTresch">Jvan Tresch</a>, an Arc’teryx Athlete, and a Dutch participant - which was a sweet ratio of Guides &amp; customers! As the weather around the Aiguille Du Midi looked rather bad we went up on the other side of the valley to the Les Aiguilles Rouges - it was nice to see the valley from the other side. We arrived up in the mist and descended to a rocky outcrop where we practiced placing protection and building anchors for a bit.</p>

<p>After that we did the <em>La someone</em> route with a variation start. I climb the first pitch in my <a href="http://bit.ly/1cLPRJN">Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX</a> boots which was a good introduction to climbing in boots, but for the subsequent pitches switched into my <a href="http://bit.ly/1AotDNA">Scarpa Techno X</a> which was a good decision - they were easier to jam into the cracks and I had less difficulty climbing some of the harder sections. Overall the route was a good introduction to alpine climbing - I led three out of four pitches, belayed the second, placed lots of protection and had Tim around to give me tips. We did four pitches before we headed back to the valley, where it quickly started to rain - a refreshing change to the 35°C we had the days before.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14764975965" title="La someone by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5554/14764975965_516802a93a_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="La someone" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14764649222" title="BMC Guide Tim Blakemore by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3847/14764649222_6155f13c5d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="BMC Guide Tim Blakemore" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14764650182" title="La someone by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3899/14764650182_47fffb359a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="La someone" /></a></p>

<p>After the rain Vincent and me went to check out the town a bit, had a Pizza with some fellow climbers and then the packing for the early start back home started. <em>So how did I like the event?</em> Easy: It was great. The <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/07/mont-blanc-the-finest-routes.html">mountains around Chamonix</a> offer some superb climbing, hiking and mountaineering and should be on anyone’s bucket list, I’d say. Add in a very well organized event with good guides, world-class athletes and hundreds of like-minded people and you have a great atmosphere and a happening which is well worth visiting.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the possibility to go on tours with three different guides - this gives you the possibility to find a guide to your liking for future trips you want to do in the mountains. I can recommend all three of my guides, they were very knowledgable, friendly and had a good sense of humour. And as clinics at the Arc’teryx Alpine Academy range in price between 35€ and 95€ it is a lot cheaper than what you’d normally pay for a day out with an UIAGM Guide. Also the whole surrounding programme at the event was enjoyable, as was the possibility to try the latest gear from Arc’teryx, Scarpa and Petzl - very convenient for those that don’t own any mountaineering gear yet. </p>

<p>Speaking of mountaineering, in my opinion the event is a good place for hikers &amp; backpackers to pick up some skills to take their trips into the mountains. Learning the rope skills for crossing glaciers and easy climbs is useful for those who like to encounter the beauty of glaciers (and the knowledge how to rescue someone in case of a crevasse fall!) and steeper terrain, or learn rock climbing from Professional climbers.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14753595783" title="Base station by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5581/14753595783_9cc558e5bf_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Base station" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Bottomline</strong>: If you’d like to experience the beauty of Chamonix’s mountains, learn valuable skills, meet like-minded people for future trips, try out the latest gear, meet different UIAGM mountain guides, chat with world-class alpinists and climbers and have a very good time, attend the next Arc’teryx Alpine Academy. You can follow them on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ARCademy">Facebook</a> to stay up to date about the next year’s event or check their <a href="http://arcteryxacademy.com/">website</a>. If you want to go - be fast with reserving the clinics you want to attend. The popular ones sell out in minutes, with the other clinics being sold out usually within a day or two. </p>

<p><strong>Logistics</strong>: We stayed at the <a href="http://www.allmountainchamonix.com/">Chalet Haute Bohème B&amp;B</a> which is a 20 minute walk from the Aigulle Du Midi base station and 5 minutes to the local climbing crag. It’s a fine place with superb breakfast (banana pancakes!), a hammock in the garden and the ultimate views on the mountains and was 75€ a night. We flew into Geneva and took the <a href="https://www.mountaindropoffs.com/">Mountain Drop-Offs Shuttle Taxi</a> to Chamonix, which was a smooth and fast ride. 26€ one way was a good price, too. There’s several Pizza places in town which have decent food around 10€, wine and beer is obviously super-affordable! In town you’ll find dozens of gear shops as well as a <a href="http://grivel.com/">Grivel</a> store where you can pick up ice axe, crampons and more. As an attendant at the Arc’teryx Alpine Academy you get some discounts on the cable car ride up, and also get some discounts for accommodation and the shuttle taxis.</p>
