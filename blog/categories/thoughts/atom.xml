    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>“Not another Gift Guide”</em>. I hear you. Here is the perfect gift for the hiker, climber, skier, cyclist and packrafter in your life. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8385427873" title="Self Portrait by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8361/8385427873_4c56d5300b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="681" alt="Self Portrait" /></a></p>

<p><em>“T’is the season!”</em>. Well, actually <em>“the season”</em> starts nowadays somewhere around September, when chocolate calendars and christmas decorations find their way into the supermarkets and the toys section doubles in size. <em>“Buy. Buy. Buy.”</em> it tells us everywhere. A couple of weeks later blogs and magazines will be full of Articles in the vein of <em>“The ultimate Gift Guide”</em>. </p>

<p>That’s why now is a good moment to reset the brain and engrain: <strong>You are not what you own.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7728232746" title="Taking in the view by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8289/7728232746_bb9a1e666c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Taking in the view" /></a></p>

<p>The hiker, climber, skier, cyclist and packrafter in your life needs just one thing this Christmas:</p>

<p><strong>Time</strong></p>

<p>Time is for our hobbies essential. A weekend away in the hills, a day at the crag, an afternoon ride or paddle - all of them need just one ting: Time. It’s our most precious resource, and it is scarily finite. Our lives are so full of things that it’s difficult for many to follow our passions, because between picking up the kids, grocery shopping, cooking, cleaning the house and other chores there’s often just too little time to pursue what we love to do. It’s the one thing you really can gift (or ask for) this Christmas: Time. It’s relatively cheap - likely free - and you can give the same gift to your partner. </p>

<p>There’s many advantages to this, not least for the environment. How long does happiness last when you get a gift? A few moments? A day? Compare that to a weekend backpacking or climbing, kayaking on the sea, a long cycling ride. That’s adventures, memories, which will last many, many years - maybe a lifetime even. Do you remember what you got last holidays? Might be hard to remember, right? How about the last weekend you were outdoors? </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8701207971" title="Packrafting &amp; Camping by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8257/8701207971_7bdcd68cd4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Packrafting &amp; Camping" /></a></p>

<p>So instead of buying something material, ask for time. You have the gear and it’s just collecting dust in the closet because it so rarely gets used. You don’t need another piece-of-something, you need to have the time to go out and use what you already have. Take your time and go on a long backpacking weekend. Use it for working on your climbing project. Cycle to that hill outside of town which you see each day on your way to work and sleep on top of it that night. </p>

<p>I’ve asked for time the last few years, and it was always a memorable present. I went to <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/03/ice-climbing-in-korouoma.html">Korouoma</a> the first weekend of this year with my time present and climbed Ruskeavirta, Finland’s highest ice waterfall. Last year I went to the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/03/abisko-ice-climbing-festival-2013-experiences.html">Abisko Ice Climbing Festival</a>, skied &amp; ice climbed and saw beautiful Northern Lights. I’m already pondering what to do with my time present this year - go on a Microadventrue? Northwards to Lapland? Or maybe even Scotland? Anticipation is the greatest joy - after being outside, of course!</p>

<p>Get time to go outdoors.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>An obituary for the winter of 2014.</p>

<p>Dear Winter,</p>

<p>I haven’t always been fond of you. As I arrived in 2002 in Finland you had the country in your icy grip, and spring couldn’t come early enough for me. Also in the next couple years, when you visited Jyväskylä with -35°C temperatures for weeks at a time, I didn’t find particular pleasure in you. </p>

<p>But I got wiser with age. I slowly started to enjoy your gifts, and took my snowboard and skis down the hills and tracks. I enjoyed walking my dog on frozen lakes, tried Nordic Tour skating, and had many laughs as I was tobogganing down steep hills with my sled. Warming up besides a warm fire with a hot Minttu kakao has become a sacred ritual, one that I carried over into summer after a long day on the trail.</p>

<p>The more time I spent outside between spring and autumn, the more I fell in love with what you had to offer. I realized that there’s no such thing as bad weather as long as one is <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/02/layering-guide-how-to-dress-for-winter.html">dressed well</a>. I became aware that you make possible things which spring, summer and autumn can’t: I am able to see the tracks of animals in the snow. On <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2011/01/backcountry-cross-country-skiing.html">skis</a> the going is fast and fun. I can build <a href="http://youtu.be/HHCZhUZXhZU">snowmens</a> with my son. Go <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2012/04/snow-wars-ultralighters-strike-back.html">winter hiking</a> with friends and swim in ice holes after a sauna. And lately I enjoy <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/02/abisko-ice-climbing-festival-2014.html">climbing steep frozen ice</a>. I explored forests and hills on my <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2010/01/video-msr-lightning-ascent-review.html">snowshoes</a>, and built snow caves.</p>

<p>But this year, you decided to not spend much time here. In early January I needed to drive 600 km north to find you. I climbed beautiful ice falls, camped on snow, and enjoyed the silence. Two weeks later you appeared here in the south and covered the land with snowflakes and the sea and lakes with ice. I took pleasure trailrunning on soft, snowy trails, climbing the local icefalls, and building a snowman with my son. It shouldn’t last. And that where I was pondering fatbikes and new <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/black-diamond-tourenski/?pid=81">skis</a>, to bring more fun and excitement to into the cold season.</p>

<p>A mere four weeks after you arrived, you are as good as gone again. I couldn’t even get the skis out for a round on the ice, let alone the local trails. Our snowman is nothing else than a sad little hill of hard-packed snow. Instead of bright, snow-lighted nights, darkness reigns again until the sun will stay up all the time. Your attempts at a comeback are half-hearted, and so I look back on memories of when you visited Finland and gave us lots of fun. May you come back in 2015 like this.</p>

<p>As for 2014, I hope that Eastern Tyrol, the Dolomites and the USA know to value your presence. I leave thee behind with the positiv prospect that the packrafting, backpacking, bouldering and rock climbing season this year will start a few months earlier as usually.</p>
