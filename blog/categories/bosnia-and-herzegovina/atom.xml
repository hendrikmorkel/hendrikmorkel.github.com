    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Via Dinarica connects seven countries, and on my final day on the trail I will hike into Montenegro and climb Maglić, the highest peak of Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina.</p>

<h2 id="day-5">Day 5</h2>

<p>Early mornings were the norm on the Via Dinarica for me, and this final day was not different. At six in the morning I was up and soon I was sitting with my friends Olja, Kenan and Tim at the breakfast table. It might be hard to imagine, but the breakfast at the <a href="http://www.umoljani.com.ba/index.html">Restaurant &amp; Pension Umoljani Bjelašnica</a> was even better than the dinner the previous evening: Local cheeses and honey, tasty warm bread, ham and marmalades - and all of it locally made. Add in a great coffee and you have the energy for a long day. </p>

<p>Before we would be climbing up Maglić we had a two hour car ride in front of us. I tried to nap as much as possible, but the stupendously beautiful scenery made that difficult. We drove through deep canyons next to raging rivers on narrow roads, and all of it looked just so gorgeous that one could have spent a fine day exploring little paths off the road. The views got wider &amp; wider and after one and half hours we passed the first signs for the <a href="http://www.npsutjeska.net/?jez=en">Sutjeska National Park</a>, the oldest National Park in Bosnia and Herzegovina and home to a large waterfall and a primeval forest. We drove up into the park, parked the car, packed up - crampons, harness, <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/petzl-sirocco-helmet.html">helmet</a> and ice axe come along - and started to hike. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19116315626/in/album-72157650519579023/" title="LAUFBURSCHE PACKsack Plus in Alpine mode"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/455/19116315626_1e3c7e9895_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="LAUFBURSCHE PACKsack Plus in Alpine mode" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The trail takes us through the forest, and soon we hike again on snow. Kenan leads the way and here and there we see the trail markers on rocks &amp; trees, and while the ground is covered in snow it is warm and the trees have already the first green leafs. After about an hour Kenan remarks that we must be in Montenegro now, and in front of us towers Maglić. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22681941816/in/dateposted/" title="Maglić in sight"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5703/22681941816_2e73e9d5d6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Maglić in sight" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The views are superb and we can see far into Montenegro, while we walk again over short stretches of grass &amp; past crocuses. It does not take long and we’re again on snow, but now it’s the steep kind. We put the harnesses on, take the ice axe in hand and start off. While Kenan and Olja wear mountaineering boots I have my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/05/arcteryx-acrux2-fl-gtx.html">Arc’teryx Acrux² FL GTX Approach Shoes</a> on, and while the crampons in my pack would fit on them I decide to go on without. The shoes have shown me on this trip that they are great on snow, so I decide I rather be fast &amp; nimble without crampons.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22707957975/in/dateposted/" title="Through the easy snow"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/606/22707957975_07eb2933ab_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Through the easy snow" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>After the first snow field we continue on a steep path which is secured a bit with a Via Ferrata cable in places, but the going is easy so the cable is largely ignored by us. Then we arrive at a 70° chute which is covered in snow, and here I decide it would be smart to rope up. Olja and Kenan agree, and a few minutes later I cross the chute first. After that it is again a mix of dry, steep paths and snow fields up to the summit ridge, where we arrive around three hours after we left the car. </p>

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17715452652/in/album-72157650519579023/" title="Looking towards Maglić"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7771/17715452652_19f6ddb3dd_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Looking towards Maglić" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>From here it is an easy stroll to the summit of Maglić &amp; some 20 minutes later we stand at the post and high five each other. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18521853943/in/album-72157650519579023/" title="Maglic, highest summit of Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/308/18521853943_2a621a239a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Maglic, highest summit of Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22694381802/in/dateposted/" title="Connecting Naturally - Via DInarica"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/618/22694381802_670310e0c7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Connecting Naturally - Via DInarica" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We put on insulation layers, get food &amp; drinks out and take in the view while enjoying the fine weather. The warm sun makes it comfortable to sit up on the summit and we spend quite a while up there to photograph, sign the summit register and eat. I then pack up and steal away in front of Kenan and Olja to shoot a few wide angle shots of the two on the summit.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22719124081/in/dateposted/" title="Kenan and Olja on Maglić Summit"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/701/22719124081_b1591ca111_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Kenan and Olja on Maglić Summit" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The two catch up with me, we rope up again for the descent and then it’s down, down, down. Descending snow slopes in approach shoes is possible but it is more comfortable in mountaineering boots I can now tell you. A mere 3 meters before the end of the snow slope I slip and manage to self-arrest, but the damage is done: Kenan smiles at me and lets me know that <em>“I told you approach shoes are no good”</em> :D </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22694377202/in/dateposted/" title="And down again"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/616/22694377202_8f21860065_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="And down again" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>After that we cross the chute again and then are going back to the car as fast as we can. We’re all hungry and thirsty - the sun has been shining the whole day again. On the way back to Sarajevo we stop at a nice road side restaurant where we eat a tasty dinner before we need to continue to Sarajevo, where we arrive late in the evening And so another fine day on the Via Dinarica went by. </p>

<h2 id="day-4">Day 4</h2>

<p>After a leisurely day of <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/10/snow-and-sunshine-on-the-via-dinarica.html">hiking on snow</a> it was time for some serious distance and ascent today. The day started at six o’clock because we hoped to avoid the 30°C heat during midday and be already in the shade of the forest up on the ridge by then. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22343041421/in/dateposted/" title="Traditional Hay Stacks"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5812/22343041421_802e1e5680_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Traditional Hay Stacks" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We crossed the bridge over the Rakitnica river, which has created here one of the deepest canyons in Europe, and encountered kids on their way to the school bus and who looked at us with a smile on the face - why would someone hike here at such an early time they likely were thinking. We pass a few houses and soon are on a narrow trail which weaves through the forest, with the river always in earshot. We cross another wobbly bridge over a turquoise river, fill up our bottles at a spring and cross a meadow with a lonely hut on it before we start our ascent up to the ridge. The thermometer is already at 30°C and the sun shines from a cloudless sky on us - it’s gonna be a hot day.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22343043831/in/dateposted/" title="Another wobbly bridge"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5812/22343043831_44e65fbf78_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Another wobbly bridge" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22343047531/in/dateposted/" title="Canyons"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/735/22343047531_516287a8b0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Canyons" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We follow the steep and overgrown trail up to the ridge, and on the other side it is two shoes wide and drops several hundred meters down to the river. The view is gorgeous - we see the complete ridge which we will be hiking today in front of us. The trail slowly weaves through the shrubbery towards the Dubocani village, and at some point we reach a forest road above Dubocani. It is lush and green down there in the village, the red roofs being a stark contrast to the green meadows. Behind it is the next hill we need to climb. We follow the forest road and colourful lizards run into the undergrowth as they hear us approach, so fast that it is difficult to snap a good photo of them.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22145588589/in/dateposted/" title="Dubocani village"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5748/22145588589_3683448260_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Dubocani village" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22332438795/in/dateposted/" title="Lizard"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/611/22332438795_763915f4b8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Lizard" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Over a soft trail of old leafs we climb the hill, refill our bottles once more at a spring next to a Shepard who tells us that his two sisters are living in Helsinki (!) and then climb further up. By the time we reach the top and start of the ridge my water bottles are empty again, and refilling them at a cistern full of death insects and dirt is somehow sub-optimal without a filter. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22144683998/in/dateposted/" title="Upwards in the shade"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5821/22144683998_378fe4e913_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Upwards in the shade" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>After a break we start our second ridge walk of the day - mostly in the hot sun, occasionally in the shade of the forest. It is so hot that I seriously question why I decided to wear the <a href="http://bit.ly/1GR5uAm">Rab Calibre Pants</a> which were great for the snowy and coolish weather on Prenj the previous days but are way too hot for this kind of hiking. But I don’t want to hike in my boxer shorts, and so we continue, kilometer after kilometer, hour after hour, always with the turquoise Rakitnica river to our right down in the canyon. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22145593739/in/dateposted/" title="A look back and the Rakitnica river down in the canyon"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/670/22145593739_892d3cdb17_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="A look back and the Rakitnica river down in the canyon" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We pass a bombed down village from the war where nowadays only Shepards life with their sheep, then climb another 400 m hill and still have many kilometers to go. I am so thirsty but don’t want to drink the “dirty” water from the cistern, but after a few hours in the heat I can’t take the thirst anymore and drink the litre in one go. We bushwhack up an hill with a 200 m drop to our right, and then finally come onto the path which will take us to Lukomir, the most remote mountain village in Bosnia and Herzegovina. I somehow am refreshed by the thought of soon being able to drink some clean water and wash my face in a cool fountain. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22144422820/in/dateposted/" title="The path to Lukomir"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/728/22144422820_5ab1b1d960_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="The path to Lukomir" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The trail contours the mountain and after a bend we can see the minaret of the Mosque of Lukomir up ahead, and the sound of a cool stream is echoing from the hills. We walk through the old, traditional village and head for the fountain, where I gulp down a litre of cold water in one go. After that Kenan and I sit down in the Café and I enjoy a tasty coffee, while we wait for our ride to the nearby <a href="http://www.umoljani.com.ba/index.html">Restaurant &amp; Pension Umoljani Bjelašnica</a>. The trail to the B&amp;B would have been short and easy Kenan tells me, but after a 30 km day with over 3.000 m of ascent and plenty of heat I am so knackered that I am happy to drive in the car there. As we arrive late in the evening we are welcomed by the owner who cooks us a tasty dinner - all ingredients are locally sourced. Full and happy I stumble to my soft bed, put my alarm on for another 6 o’clock alpine start, and fall soundly asleep.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22332446435/in/dateposted/" title="Lukomir Village"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/749/22332446435_2714e82ccd_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Lukomir Village" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The defining memory of the day is not the heat, the sun, the fine hiking, the cold fountain in Lukomir, the old huts and tasty Bosnian coffee or even the utterly delicious food in the evening, no, it is the smell of Herzegovina that I was breathing in and out during the early morning. The dry, sweet and warm smell is a mix of the earth, flowers, water and trees of the region and is so beautiful, that it alone would be a reason for me to hike that section again. </p>

<h2 id="day-3">Day 3</h2>

<p>We spend the night in the wonderful Vrutak hut, and having decided the day before that we won’t climb Otiš because of the wintery conditions we could sleep in and take it easy. The Vrutak Hut really was great, a cozy hut with plenty of space for six or more mountaineers or hikers. You’ll need to get a key to sleep in it, but outside there would have been plenty of good spots for a <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/09/hyperlite-mountain-gear-ultamid.html">UltaMid</a> or similar. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22004362168/in/dateposted/" title="Vrutak Hut inside"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/645/22004362168_3d025b871a_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Vrutak Hut inside" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>After we packed up our light packs it was time to go on. We climbed the snoy slopes till the pass and then took a left. The sun was shining warm and nice on us, but the cold wind meant we wore our hardshells to stay warm. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18954779610/in/album-72157650519579023/" title="Julbo Trek underneath Otiš and Zelena Glava in Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/499/18954779610_18fc8a33e4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Julbo Trek underneath Otiš and Zelena Glava in Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>But the views today? </p>

<p>They were superb. We took it easy and were in no rush, because we skipped the seven to eight hour climbing adventure we could walk in peace and enjoy the views. </p>

<p>We had a relaxed lunch at the nice Jezerce Mountain Hut, which like all the other mountain huts had been build by hand, from materials which horse and human had carried up the mountain. </p>

<p>After a few more hours of walking underneath beautiful mountain tops and on snow we reached greeen meadows which were full of flowers. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22004379498/in/dateposted/" title="Flowers"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5693/22004379498_72f85e43d7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Flowers" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>But the snow remained a companion - funnily enough the forests were free of snow but the trails still covered in half a meter of snow here and there.</p>

<p>After some bushwacking through the forest - the trail was over-grown - we reached a nice grassy trail through pretty meadows. It was still early afternoon as we reached the forest road, where we met Edin, a friend of my Guide Kenan, who gave us a lift to the <a href="http://vila-sunce.com">Vila Sunce</a> where we would spend the night. We had a wee stop at an Café at the shore of the Boračko jezero Lake and then had a look at the Rakitnica river, which would be ideal for packrafting. Alas, I didn’t bring my packraft - maybe the next time!</p>

<h2 id="day-2">Day 2</h2>

<p><em>“Where am I? Who is up at this hour where the world doesn’t exist yet?”</em></p>

<p>Ah ja, I’m at the Medjuprenje Mountain Hut, up on Prenj, on the Via Dinarica in Bosnia and Herzegovina. My name is Hendrik and that tiny backpack is mine. Yeah, systems booting, coffee required before we can get up and start hiking.</p>

<p>Black gold is served steaming hot by Kenan’s friends &amp; again I ponder about the weight &amp; taste benefits of carrying real coffee to the mountains. Also the breakfast Kenan has for me is great: Joghurt &amp; Müsli, where the yoghurt is dehydrated and stirred up by adding water. Good stuff, and after everything is eaten and packed up we leave the hut and move up into the fog. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/21189069176/in/dateposted-public/" title="Grey &amp; Brown"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/720/21189069176_b6b9a8357a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Grey &amp; Brown" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The trail is well marked and takes us through trees which are ready for spring, but yet hold back their green leafs. The higher we get the lower the vegetation becomes and the shorter the view. But Prenj, the mountain we’re on, is Kenan’s favourite and he knows it well. We follow markers and cairns, bushwack through the shrubbery and then take a <em>“Shortcut”</em>. I love shortcuts, especially in this weather.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/21189069426/in/dateposted-public/" title="Grey &amp; Grey"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5719/21189069426_3e13cd911f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Grey &amp; Grey" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><em>Ah no, not here. Lets go that way.</em></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/20592646934/in/dateposted-public/" title="Grey &amp; white &amp; grey"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5803/20592646934_d732f5bf0e_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Grey &amp; white &amp; grey" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><em>Can you see where we are?</em></p>

<p>Nope, don’t you have a compass? </p>

<p><em>Ah yeah, true!</em></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/21027209230/in/dateposted-public/" title="Grey &amp; yellow"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5798/21027209230_d601a479d2_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Grey &amp; yellow" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Alright, this way. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/20594192193/in/dateposted-public/" title="Grey"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5724/20594192193_0264e1be57_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Grey" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>At one point we dropped down a bit in elevation and ended up ascending an 60°+ snow slope, without <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/04/grivel-g20-crampons.html">crampons</a> or <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/ice-axes/">ice axes</a>, in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/05/arcteryx-acrux2-fl-gtx.html">approach shoes</a>. To say I was a bit freaked out would be putting it kindly, as underneath me it went down a couple of hundred meters and a slip would have ended in a coffin. But hey. Type 2 fun. Makes for a good story right now, doesn’t it? </p>

<p>Kenan navigated us just great back to the track, and then it was smooth hiking over snow fields and talus. After a while Kenan knew exactly where we were and started again telling me the names of the summits that surrounded us as we walked down on a high plateau. Snow disappeared, the brown grass trail being pierced by purple crocuses and slowly turning to brown dirt to green meadows. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/21027208090/in/dateposted-public/" title="Purple &amp; brown"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/623/21027208090_db791fd8b3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Purple &amp; brown" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We traverse the high plateau and the troubles of getting a bit lost earlier are forgotten. We’re set to meet Tim and the Terra Dinarica Team as well as some guests from the USA down in the valley, and are relieved to see that we’re the first to the meeting point. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/21189067606/in/dateposted-public/" title="Green"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5644/21189067606_ed61c26b53_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Green" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>After walking mostly on snow the day before and this morning it is nice to have green grass and sunshine. We drop our packs, I get out of my shoes, and we walk around in the valley, towards the others who are just arriving. Food is shared, photos are snapped, and the beauty around us is celebrated by long, lonely stares, <em>“Ahhh”s</em> and <em>“Ohhh”s</em> and <em>“Wow”s</em>. And it is pretty, this valley. Otiš and Zelena Glava stand proudly at the end of the valley, a miniature Fitz Roy Range. We did plan to climb Otiš the next day, but seeing it is in full alpine conditions and our lack of alpine gear makes me decide against an ascent. I also wasn’t up for a 14 hour day, though it certainly would have made a great story &amp; experience. So we will just hike comfortably across Prenj and arrive early at our destination the next day - a good decision as we’d see the tomorrow.</p>

<p>After a lengthy late lunch we part with our friends and head back up the mountain, though our destination is not far. The Vrutak hut is less than 30 minutes up from the valley and luxurious hut by any standard. Clean at a prime location its nice to know we will sleep in such a nice hut tonight. I grab my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/03/velbon-v-pod.html">tripod</a> and head out to photograph the sunset and blue hour while Kenan prepares our dinner. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18956352609/in/album-72157650519579023/" title="Enjoying the sunset on Otiš and Zelena Glava in Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/485/18956352609_27e93cc7fe_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Enjoying the sunset on Otiš and Zelena Glava in Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>With a big smile I come back in after the sun is gone and the first stars dot the sky. Kenan has prepared a delicious goulash, and I share a Finnish dessert with him to celebrate this adventurous day. We sit for a while and talk, but both of us are tired and soon turn in. Tomorrow would be <em>“easy and relaxed”</em>… </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What makes the Via Dinarica <em>The best trail of 2014</em>? Is it the idea of connecting seven countries via humanities simplest activity, walking? Or something else? Reason enough for me to pack my backpack, book a flight to Sarajevo and investigate.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19297808236" title="Almost there by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/393/19297808236_97eaf58052_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Almost there" /></a></p>

<p><em>“What are your expectations of this trip?”</em> Tim asked me after he picked me up at the airport in Sarajevo. <em>“Well”</em>, I started, <em>“I don’t have any. I never expect anything when I go on a research trip, and let the region show me what it has to offer. It’s only fair and more adventurous, too.”</em>  But Bosnia and Herzegovina has impressed me, very positively. It’s a beautiful country with warm, welcoming people, delicious food, and the views are quite decent, too. In the following series of trip reports I’ll walk you through the Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina part of the Via Dinarica Trail, and will answer questions in the final post where I also will give more information on the trail.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19136258770" title="Sarajevo by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3666/19136258770_cc1244bbdd_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Sarajevo" /></a></p>

<h2 id="sarajevo">Sarajevo</h2>

<p><em>“Coffee?”</em> Sure. As an European Finn I seldom say no to coffee, and the coffee in Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina is superb, especially when brewed in the traditional way. Besides, I was up since 4 am and already had three different flights so something to keep me awake in the sweltering heat of this bustling city was always welcome. We had good coffee and then a stroll through the old part of Sarajevo, which was gorgeous with small, narrow streets lined with stalls, open air Cafés, Restaurants where delicious smells wafted from the open windows, and lots of people. Mosques stood next to Churches, and the peaceful co-existence of the religions in this country is certainly something the world could learn. </p>

<p>Later in the afternoon I meet the rest of the Terra Dinarica team, Olja, Stefan and Kenan, who would be my Guide over the next five days. We had a tasty dinner high above Sarajevo, before Kenan dropped me off at my Hostel for the night. <em>“Pick up is at 5 am”</em> he said with a smile, and so I turned in after a quick shower to get some sleep before the Alarm would wake me up yet again so early.</p>

<h2 id="risovac-to-diva-grabovica">Risovac to Diva Grabovica</h2>

<p>This 27,6 km section started at a ski slope a couple of hours drive south west of Sarajevo. Already on the way there we passed with the car scenery which would make any backpacker and climber very happy indeed, with a <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18703305363/in/album-72157650519579023/">Mini El Cap</a> and lush, green valleys which would make for fine hiking. Here at the Risovac ski centre Kenan and me shoulder our backpacks, said bye to Tim who’d meet us at the other side, and set off.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18703269283" title="At the start by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/516/18703269283_e92f6c0d92_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="At the start" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19327844291" title="Through the forest by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/428/19327844291_1d0a97d467_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Through the forest" /></a></p>

<p>We quickly reach the top of the ski slope and turned into the forest, where patches of snow still lined the trail. It didn’t take us long to be so high that the trail was under the snow, and I was pondering if my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/05/arcteryx-acrux2-fl-gtx.html">Arc’teryx Acrux² FL GTX</a> shoes would be up to the task (They were, and great on the snow indeed). Where the trail skirts the mountain on the south/ west side, the snow was happily gone, but also walking on the snow was fine - it was still fairly compact with just a thin, mushy layer on top which gave good grip.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19327855101" title="Trailmarker by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3919/19327855101_aa9c6a7a5e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Trailmarker" /></a></p>

<p>The weather was great - so warm that I quickly shed layers and hiked in my T-Shirt. Kenan tells me about the mountain we traverse, the sights, where the Via Dinarica passes here and local lore. He’s also a good model and doesn’t protest when I let him walk several sections twice to get the right shot, but even with all the chatting and taking photos we make good speed and soon see the summit we’re aiming for today, the Great Vilinac Summit. The trail towards it sneaks through patches of low-growing shrubbery, and spring crocuses are piercing their white and violet heads already through the ground there where the snow has melted.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18703292873" title="Snow &amp; Green by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/381/18703292873_43f737a76c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Snow &amp; Green" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18701483194" title="Under the snow by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/494/18701483194_990870e0c0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Under the snow" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19136404998" title="Summit by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3750/19136404998_9fbf454c9f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Summit" /></a></p>

<p>The summit is snow-free and after signing the summit book we sit and have a drink. The view is fantastic and we’re lucky with the weather. But we arranged to have lunch at a mountain hut a bit further along the trail, and so we soon shoulder our light packs again and head onwards to the Tise Mountain Hut. It’s a bit off the trail and we descent for ten minutes, but already from a distance it looks like it is closed. As we stand in front of the locked doors we’re certain that we won’t be eating lunch here, a good thing we have some snacks with us and that the bench and table have a scenic view to enjoy. We go for a look to find the water spring nearby, but it is still buried under a meter of snow, and so we just continue.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18703352493" title="Mountain Hut by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/456/18703352493_0e1322e538_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Mountain Hut" /></a>

<p>We follow the trailmarkers - a red circle with a white dot in the middle - for a while, until we’re back on the snow. While it allows us to make short-cuts it’s also a bit more strenuous to walk on it, and of course it also soaks your shoes and socks. But it’s warm &amp; sunny, so not a problem, merely a slight inconvenience. We’re high up and descent and ascend just a little for several kilometres, until it is time for the big 1.600 m descent to the Diva Grabovica valley. The views which open up before us are breath-taking, but you have to stop to enjoy then, as the descent is steep on a trail which is often just a mere foot wide, if it’s not entirely covered under the snow.</p>

<p>Ahead of us we also can see Prenj, the mountain range we will be traversing in the next two days. Soon enough we reach the tree line and lush green beech trees with fresh, young leaves make the walking in the warm weather more pleasant. From afar we already saw a rustic cabin - the former Kings Hunting Cabin - and we made a little detour to visit it. It was pretty from the outside, with wooden shingles on the face of the building, but the inside was mouldy, dark and not welcoming. Also the garbage which was left wasn’t a nice sight, and so we continued further down. </p>

<p>We heard voices already further up the mountain, and as we happened on the 2nd hut - which was in much better shape - we meet Tim and friends of Kenan, who did the <a href="http://planinarenje.ba/planinarske-ture/cvrsnica/712-zli-potok-tise-zlijeb-9-5-2015#!">Evil’s Creek Route</a> (scroll down to see their photos!), a trail which has some climbing along steel wires (a bit like like a Via Ferrata) and were now also on the way back down. We decided to go check out the Look out point and have a cup of coffee all together, and it was a nice place to rest and drink some good Bosnian coffee. </p>

<p>On the way to the valley the trail soon became a gorgeous green tunnel which smelled so wonderful, it was unbelievable. Colourful flowers, buzzing insects, colourful butterflies and bubbling wells we found the further we descended the trail, and as we finally broke out of the dense green forest a magnificent panorama opened up before us. A colourful little meadow stood in full flowers, while the sun was hiding behind big, dramatic grey clouds, throwing a few rays on the mountains we just left behind. It was such a perfect place that I’d loved to have put my tarp up right there, but we still had a few hundred meters to descent and move onwards, so we left the meadow behind and hiked on.</p>

<p>At the car we threw our packs into the car and drove towards the next Restaurant, where we enjoyed a dinner of lamb and a local beer before Tim brought us to Prenj. It was night as we arrived the start of the trail, and after a quick repack for the next two days we set off. I was completely destroyed as we started to hike, but pushed on. While I was planning to sleep in my bivy outside instead of the Medjuprenje Mountain Hut where we were headed, after I saw a few Scorpions on the trail and Kenan told me about the Black Widows Spiders which can be encountered here I decided that the hut it would be. It was close to 23 o’clock as we stumbled into the Medjuprenje Mountain Hut, where other friends of Kenan right away offered us a Rakija, and after a zip of this tasty fruit brandy I headed up to roll out my quilt and call it a night. <strong>To be continued.</strong></p>
