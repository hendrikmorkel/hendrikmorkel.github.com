    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dragons and <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.co.uk/dmm-demon-cam-cam/">Demons</a> are not just part of any good fantasy novel, but also hang on the harness of many Trad Climbers. And because for longer routes you need more than just a set of <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/dmm-dragon-cams.html">Dragon Cams</a>, a pair of Demon Cams has found their way into my climbing pack. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16743368694" title="DMM Demon Cams by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7688/16743368694_34f21b81ce_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="DMM Demon Cams" /></a></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.co.uk/dmm-demon-cam-cam/">DMM Demon Cams</a> arrived last spring and have been along to Olhava, the local crag close to Vaasa, <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/mountaineering-and-climbing-in-the-polish-tatras.html">rock climbing in Poland</a> and Alpine climbing in Chamonix. But why would I need a 2nd pair of cams besides the Dragons? Well, longer routes need more protection, the Demon Cams have different size ranges than the Dragon, are a single axle design and are lighter. That was enough reason for me to get a pair from <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.co.uk/">Bergfreunde.co.uk</a>, and since they have free shipping on orders over 50€ in Europe it has gotten pretty easy to order from them.</p>

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/49821137?color=cc0033&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>The Demon is a combination of two DMM Cams: It takes the single stem of the Dragon and the Cams of the 4CU. They are single axle, single stem, with the trademark extendable Dyneema sling. The cam lobes make use of the 13.75° camming angle, have an Active strength rating of 14 kN (and a Passive rating of 10 kN) and are Made in Wales.</p>

<p>As you might know, cams are active protection. While the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/02/dmm-wallnuts.html">nuts and hexes</a> have no moving parts, cams do have moving parts - this allows them to suit a wider range of cracks - where you might need to carry one or more different nuts to place them in a crack, a cam’s lobes can be moved by pulling on the trigger which makes them narrower &amp; thus you can enter it in a crack. Release the trigger and the lobes will wedge themselves into the rock, being, if placed correctly, a solid piece of protection. They are also versatile in the sense that you can use them passively - that is that you just place the cam as it is into a crack, much like a Nut, without pulling the trigger. Unlike the DMM Dragon Cams the Demon Cam has a lower passive strength rating than active rating. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16743368334" title="DMM Demon Cams by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8774/16743368334_eff30e3137_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="DMM Demon Cams" /></a></p>

<p>The Demons come without a carabiner, so I got the colour-coded <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.co.uk/dmm-alpha-trad-non-locking-carabiner/">DMM Alpha Trad ‘biners</a> and two <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.co.uk/dmm-phantom-non-locking-carabiner/">Phantom carabiners</a> with the cams. The Trad biners are very nice and easy to clip, quite large and at 34 g they’re still light. The Phantom is only 26 g but you can easily feel and note the difference in size, its gate is also a bit heavier to clip. If you get pumped or nervous and want to be sure you can easily and quickly clip the rope, take the Alpha trad carabiners, they have a far better handling. Cam Lobes, slings and Alpha Trad carabiners can (and should!) be colour-matched for easily finding the right cam when you’re on the wall.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17365876125" title="DMM Demon Cams by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8824/17365876125_aaf623fb92_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="DMM Demon Cams" /></a></p>

<p>Back to the Demon Cams, and lets look at their weights. Here’s the weight of the Demon Cam alone and with a Alpha Trad carabiner.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Size 4,0: 223 g (259 g)</li>
  <li>Size 3,5: 182 g (218 g)</li>
  <li>Size 2,5: 129 g (165 g)</li>
  <li>Size 1,5: 102 g (138 g)</li>
  <li>Size 1,0: 98 g (134 g)</li>
  <li>Size 0,5: 90 g (126 g)</li>
  <li>Size 0: 84 g (120 g)</li>
</ul>

<p>The whole rack of seven Demon cams with Alpha Trad biners is 1.160 g. That is a tad heavier than the Dragons (the six of them including carabiners is 819 g) but the size range of the Demons here speaks for them. For comparison:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Size 4 Demon Cam (223 g) has a lobe size range of 64 to 100 mm</li>
  <li>Size 4 Dragon Cam (149 g) has a lobe size range of 38 to 64 mm</li>
</ul>

<p>This difference can be seen throughout the two Cam lines. If you want to have a <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.co.uk/camming-devices/">Cam</a> with a large operating range, then the Demon is the way to go my opinion.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17365533331" title="DMM Demon Cams by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8899/17365533331_95f25e7afa_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="DMM Demon Cams" /></a></p>

<p>The 8 mm Dyneema sling is extendable to 23 cm which allows you to carry less slings and quick-draws to the hills. I love this feature of the DMM Cams and wouldn’t want to miss it. DMM also thinks along and offers a service to re-sling the cams when the Dyneema slings become worn out, which is a sustainable and environmentally friendly service and makes the cams long-lasting.</p>

<p>Which brings me to Quality. Which is fantastic. I guess you have expected this already, but I really value these cams - as all my other gear from DMM - very highly. The flexible stem, durable materials that are anodized makes them long-lasting, also at <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/04/sea-stack-climbing-in-ireland.html">sea stacks</a>. They have seen quite a bit of use but still look pretty good, and I expect them to last many more years.</p>

<p>If there’s something which I don’t like about them, well they are expensive - but then so are most cams. I also am wondering why DMM does repeat colours on the cams and ‘biners - Gold, Blue and Silver are used twice in the same series, and with there being hundreds of colours this is a bit odd. I would wish DMM would add more colours in the future, this makes it easier to choose the right cam and eliminates mix-ups. Imagine you want to grab the large blue 3.5 cam but grab the tiny blue 0 cam? Also the stem could be a tiny bit longer, which would make it easier to place them in deep cracks. I also think they could be offered as a complete set with a carabiner (preferably for a better price than buying them separately). And finally, if they’d be a <em>tiny</em> bit lighter, well, I wouldn’t mind that either!</p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>I really like <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.co.uk/brands/dmm/">DMM</a> gear. It’s well-designed and Made in Europe, which I value a lot. With the climbing trips this year I reckon the Dragons and Demons will both see plenty of use, especially in the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/03/the-dolomites-rock-climbs-and-via-ferrata.html">Dolomites</a> and here in Finland. If you’re new to Trad climbing and in the market for some active protection then you might want to have a chat with your climbing partners and see what they recommend for your home crag, but eventually, and especially when you will travel to go climbing, you will likely end up with a complete rack or more. With the Demons you get a superb single stem, single axle cam. You’ll value the extendable sling pretty quickly as it allows you to leave some Quick-draws at the bottom of the crag. They are easy to place and equally easy to remove if you second. These durable cams will not make you a better climber, but they are so long-lasting that they will see you become better over time. </p>

<p>You can get the complete DMM Demon Cam package at <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.co.uk/dmm-demon-cam-cam/">Bergfreunde.co.uk</a> in Europe and <a href="http://bit.ly/1JLrstV">Backcountry.com</a> in North America.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Besides being <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/02/dmm-wallnuts.html">nuts for climbing</a>, for Trad also a set of Cams was needed. I sticked to the brand I trust, <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/dmm/">DMM</a>, and got myself <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/dmm-dragon-cam-friend-00/">six little Dragons</a> to play with. Easy to place and reliable when it counts, after a season of use I couldn’t be more happy with them! <em>A living review.</em></p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>Six <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/dmm-dragon-cam-friend-00/">DMM Dragon Cams</a> found their way to me in spring 2013, and I had them out on several outings to the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/04/on-the-rocks.html">local crag</a> and to <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/07/climbing-at-havukallio.html">Havukallio</a>. I also carried them along a couple of times to mixed climbs, but they stayed unused. All in all they have been out on seven outings.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/12779778254/" title="DMM Dragon Cams by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3682/12779778254_642516b579_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="DMM Dragon Cams" /></a></p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>Unlike nuts cams, or friends as they’re also know, are pieces of active protection. While the nuts and hexes have no moving parts, cams do have moving parts. This enables them to suit a wider range of cracks - where you might need to carry one or more different nuts to place them in a crack, a cam’s lobes can be moved by pulling on the trigger, which makes them narrower and thus you can enter it in a crack. Release the trigger and the lobes will wedge themselves into the rock, being, if placed correctly, a solid pice of protection. They are also versatile in the sense that you can use them passively - that is that you just place the cam as it is into a crack, much like a Nut, without pulling the trigger. What’s special about the DMM Dragon Cams is that in passive mode they have the same strength as in active mode.</p>

<p>Unlike Nuts you usually already equip the cams with a <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/karabiner/">carabiner</a>, I like to use the <a href="http://dmmclimbing.com/products/phantom/">DMM Phantom</a> as I can colour-match them with the cams. What’s also unique about the DMM Dragons is that they have an extendable dyneema sling, which allows you to extend it to your needs. This helps to save weight as you don’t need to carry extra slings or quickdraws, too.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>The Dragon cam is a lightweight single stem design with dual axles and a thumb grip and trigger bar. It’s easy to handle and the extendable Dyneema sling is genius. It uses the original 13.75° camming angle and the cam lobes are hot forged. The plastic-covered stem is very flexible yet very durable.</p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>I could wax on lyrically about how awesome Dragons are and their design process, or I could just let DMM tell it themselves. It’s an awesome video, well worth watching!</p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>They’re superb. As with most everything from DMM there went a lot of design thought, testing, re-designing, more testing, and high-quality manufacturing into making the product you see in front of you. It’s a great piece of kit that will serve you well. If you need to get the Dragon’ Dyneema sling re-done, you can send the Dragons to Wales where DMM will fix them for a reasonable price.</p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>Friends are heavier than Nuts but you can carry less to cover the same range as a set of nuts. </p>

<ul>
  <li>DMM Dragon Friend 4, 149g (177 g incl. Phantom ‘biner)</li>
  <li>DMM Dragon Friend 3, 123g (152 g incl. Phantom ‘biner)</li>
  <li>DMM Dragon Friend 2, 114g (143 g incl. Phantom ‘biner)</li>
  <li>DMM Dragon Friend 1, 101g (129 g incl. Phantom ‘biner)</li>
  <li>DMM Dragon Friend 0, 87g (112 g incl. Phantom ‘biner)</li>
  <li>DMM Dragon Friend 00, 78g (106 g incl. Phantom ‘biner)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>TOTAL:</strong> 652 g (819 g incl. ‘biners)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/12779341615/" title="DMM Dragon Cams by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3728/12779341615_c318664d1e_b.jpg" width="680" height="1024" alt="DMM Dragon Cams" /></a></p>

<h2 id="sustainability--recyclability">Sustainability &amp; Recyclability</h2>

<p>DMM manufactures their Cams in Wales, which makes the transport to us in Europe short. Aluminium, steel and plastic, the main components, can be easily recycled - just drop them at your scrap yard, and depending on the size of your rack you even might get enough money to go buy a pint in the pub afterwards. Aluminium has a large electricity footprint, but the alternative would be to climb free solo. While DMM doesn’t lose a word about possible sustainability programs they adhere to, they have a page on their <a href="http://dmmclimbing.com/about/quality/">Quality management</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/12779472173/" title="DMM Dragon Cams by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7324/12779472173_da162a26a4_b.jpg" width="680" height="1024" alt="DMM Dragon Cams" /></a></p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p>I got the two sets of Sizes <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/dmm-dragon-cam-friend-set-00-0-1/">00, 0 and 1</a> and <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/dmm-dragon-cam-friend-set-2plus3plus4/">2, 3 and 4</a> which covers a good range for the climbing I do here in Scandi-land. Maybe I will add a Size 5 and 6 in due time to complete the rack, especially if that trip to Norway will happen.</p>

<p>The small rack of Dragons weighs just a bit over 800 g including carabiners, which is very good. As a Trad climber you’re carrying usually already a large amount of gear - Nuts, QDs, Slings, Nutbuster, etc. - so saving a bit of weight is nice. Add in that you can leave some QDs and slings behind as the slings on the Dragons extend and at once you have the chance to save quite a bit more of weight. Which for the few Multi-pitch routes here is maybe not that of note, but head over to Sweden, Norway or the Alps and things start to look longer and hence saving weight is a feasible thing to save energy.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/12779353765/" title="DMM Dragon Cams by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7346/12779353765_b1b6cb69a0_b.jpg" width="680" height="1024" alt="DMM Dragon Cams" /></a></p>

<p>As with the Nuts, I tested placing the Cams at the bottom of the crag, seeing which sizes fit which size of crack, and then roped up and started climbing. Placing the Cams is intuitive - pull the trigger, enter the cam into the crack, release the trigger, adjust the position if needed, clip the rope, climb on. It’s a fairly quick process, maybe a few seconds faster than placing a nut as you don’t need to clip a QD before you clip the rope, so on long climbs (or at the start of the season when you’re not as fit) it gets you less pumped. </p>

<p>If you already have a cam rack, lets say of <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/black-diamond-camalot-c4-gr-0-3/">BD Camalot C4s</a>, you might need some getting used to with the DMM thumb stop which differs a bit from the BD thumb loop. For me, this being my first cams, it was no problem at all and I like the ease of use on this design, but I see how long-time BD users might need to switch their thinking. The Dragons are also a tad shorter than the Camalots. The slightly shorter design might be especially difficult for those that second and need to clean up, but that’s where a Nutbuster comes in useful.</p>

<p>Most of the DMM Dragons have a strength of 14 kN in every configuration, be it active or passive or slings extended or not, which will give you some peace of mind when you’re climbing above your last piece of protection and worry about a fall. I myself fell on the 00 cam (rated only at 9 kN, but I had a Nut close by) and the cam held the fall without a problem. I was a bit shaken, but otherwise fine. Even getting it out after the fall was easy, unlike the nut which needed the Nutbuster to get out. </p>

<h2 id="competing-products">Competing Products</h2>

<p>There’s a whole range of competing products, some a bit more affordable, others more expensive than DMM. <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/black-diamond-camalot-x4-gr-0-1/">Black Diamond</a> is a very well-known cam maker, as are <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/wild-country-helium-friend-set-0-5-1-5-2-5/">Wild Country</a>, <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/omega-pacific-link-cam-0-5/">Omega Pacific</a>, <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/metolius-offset-master-cam-gr-00-0/">Metolius</a>, <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/climbing-technology-anchor-friend-set-1-5/">Climbing Technology</a> and <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/lacd-lunatic-cam-gr-0-5-red/">LACD</a>. Similar in function are the <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/camp-tricam-set-0-125-2/">CAMP Tricam</a>, <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/camp-ball-nuts-gr-1/">CAMP Ballnuts</a> and <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/kong-gipsy-klemmgeraet-set-4-6/">Kong Gipsy</a>.</p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>If you’ve read till here and want to build a Trad Rack™ my recommendation is to get a set of Dragon Cams to accompany your passive protection. But first go to your local Trad guru and quiz her/ him about which sizes you should get for your area, as it could be that you maybe will need only very narrow cams and hence better double up on the smaller sizes instead of a complete rack. I love the extendable Dyneema sling, a really smart idea that lets me carry less slings and QDs. I find placing them easy and as I fell on one I know that they’re safe to hold a fall. Also cleaning them up if you second is usually easy, and it’s seldom that one would need a <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/dmm-nutbuster-keilentferner/">Nutbuster</a> to help with removing a strongly placed cam. Overall a beautifully made piece of gear that functions extremely well, and while not making you a better climber it will help you to feel safer on sketchy climbs.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>“You’re nuts!”</em> Might be, but then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_climbing">Trad Climbing</a> requires a set of nuts (amongst other things, as you will see), as in this style of climbing you place the protection yourself, instead of relying on pre-installed bolts (as in sport climbing). <em>“Can such a nut hold a fall?</em> you might be wondering. I didn’t plan to try, but then things don’t always go according to plan.</p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>I got my set of <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/dmm-wallnuts-klemmkeile/">DMM Wallnuts</a>, <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/dmm-offset-nuts-klemmkeile/">DMM Offset Nuts</a> and <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/dmm-torque-nuts-klemmkeile/">DMM Torque Nuts</a> in spring 2013, and had them out on several outings to the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/04/on-the-rocks.html">local crag</a> and to <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/07/climbing-at-havukallio.html">Havukallio</a>. I carried them along a couple of times to mixed climbs, but sticked to ice. All in all they have been on about seven outings.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9250664167/" title="A Rack of Nuts"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3694/9250664167_11334210a9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="A Rack of Nuts" /></a></p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>A Nut is a metal - usually aluminium - wedge threaded on a wire which you place in a crack on your climb. You then clip a <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/express-sets/">Quickdraw</a> into the nut’s wire, and clip your rope through it. They’re know as passive protection, as there is no moving parts (well, you can move the steel wire a bit, as well as the Dyneema cord, but really, they’re passive) - as opposed to active protection like Cams, which have moving parts.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>Available in 11 sizes for the Wallnuts, five sizes for the Alloy Offsets and four sizes of the Torque Nuts, the first two sets are colour coded for easy recognition (it pays off to practice with them at the bottom of the crag and learn which colour fits which size of crack), and are compatibility with other brands, too. The Torque Nuts have a double dyneema sling which can be extended, while the larger nuts have holes in them to make them lighter. Take a look at these three videos, which explain them pretty well.</p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations--quality">Technical Innovations &amp; Quality</h2>

<p>All three sets are Made in Wales, and have undergone much trying and testing on the cliffs and crags of Snowdonia before ending up in our hands. The Wallnut shape has been enhanced by adding a scoop to improve security in shallow placements, which does work well, and the sizes generally match well, as you could see in the above video. Really smart ist the extendable Dyneema sling on the Torque Nuts: Keep it short at the base, extend it further up to reduce rope drag or when placing it deep in a crack. The quality is superb, as you know it will be from DMM.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/12654150594/" title="Torque by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://s2.yimg.com/sk/3741/12654150594_d0216f216d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Torque" /></a></p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>In the big picture, Nuts from Black Diamond, Wild Country, CAMP and DMM weigh pretty much the same. Some companies have a couple of larger or smaller sizes so a set will weigh more, but overall a modern standard rack will be the same weight.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wallnuts:</li>
  <li>DMM Nut 11, 68g</li>
  <li>DMM Nut 10, 57g</li>
  <li>DMM Nut 9, 51g</li>
  <li>DMM Nut 8, 46g</li>
  <li>DMM Nut 7, 39g</li>
  <li>DMM Nut 6, 37g</li>
  <li>DMM Nut 5, 33g</li>
  <li>DMM Nut 4, 29g</li>
  <li>DMM Nut 3, 27g</li>
  <li>DMM Nut 2, 25g</li>
  <li>DMM Nut 1, 16g</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>TOTAL: 428 g</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>Offset Nuts:</li>
  <li>DMM Offset Nut 11, 55g</li>
  <li>DMM Offset Nut 10, 45g</li>
  <li>DMM Offset Nut 9, 37g</li>
  <li>DMM Offset Nut 8, 29g</li>
  <li>DMM Offset Nut 7, 27g</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>TOTAL: 193 g</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>Torque Nuts:</li>
  <li>DMM Torque Nut 4, 144g</li>
  <li>DMM Torque Nut 3, 100g</li>
  <li>DMM Torque Nut 2, 72g</li>
  <li>DMM Torque Nut 1, 55g</li>
  <li><strong>TOTAL: 371 g</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>And the DMM Nutbuster is 54g. Which makes the whole passive protection part of the Trad Rack™ <strong>1.046 g</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="sustainability--recyclability">Sustainability &amp; Recyclability</h2>

<p>DMM manufactures their Nuts in Wales, which makes the transport to us in Europe short. Aluminium and steel, the main ingredients of the Nuts, can be easily recycled - just drop them at your scrap yard, and depending on the size of your rack you even might get enough money to go buy a pint in the pub. Of course Aluminium has a large electricity footprint, but the alternative would be to climb free solo. While DMM doesn’t lose a word about possible sustainability programs they adhere to, they have a page on their <a href="http://dmmclimbing.com/about/quality/">Quality management</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/12653297895/" title="DMM Wallnuts"><img src="https://ycpi-farm6.staticflickr.com/5512/12653297895_1d94424453_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="DMM Wallnuts" /></a></p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p>After watching several videos on <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/05/rock-climbing-for-beginners.html">how to place nuts</a> I took my shiny new gear to the crag and started placing them, to get a feel for which colour fits into which width of a crack. The learning was pretty straight forward, so upwards I went. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/12653798953/" title="Busting"><img src="https://v4s.yimg.com/so/7372/12653798953_fa271a8837_b.jpg" width="1024" height="455" alt="Busting" /></a></p>

<p>The placing of the nuts while being 15 m high was, thanks to having practiced it, fairly simple. Of course it’s slightly more challenging to place a piece of gear when you’re keeping yourself up with one hand, search with the other hand for the right size of nut, unclip it from the ‘biner, add a QD and then clip the rope. But it’s just a question of training a far as I am concerned. The colour-coding helped me well to find the nut I needed quickly - <em>“That crack looks like a red offset”</em>. </p>

<p>And then the opening question: Can a Nut take a fall? Yes, it can (if well placed). On the last climb of the weekend at Havukallio, some 2 meters from the top out I slipped about a meter above my last placement and took a fall of around three meters. The Nut and Cam held like a bomb, and while I was startled I was happy that my placements held. It helps to build up trust in your [placement] skills, and probably makes you a better climber. Although I rather wouldn’t have fallen, and just topped out.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/12653813324/" title="DMM Torque Nuts"><img src="https://ycpi-farm8.staticflickr.com/7406/12653813324_52cdbf0c72_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="DMM Torque Nuts" /></a></p>

<p>Even when I thought I placed a nut well, it has happened that one has moved out of the crack. This was more the case with the regular Wallnuts than with the Offsets, but could really have been just a case of “sloppy placement”. Or that the rope drag played the nut loose. This isn’t a big deal on relatively safe routes, but could be a serious safety concern on run-out routes. In that case either make damn well sure your placement is bomber, or use a piece of active protection.</p>

<h2 id="competing-products">Competing Products</h2>

<p>You can have a whole rack of Nuts from many different manufacturers. Black Diamond, Wild Country, CAMP, Climbing Technology and Metolius all make various kinds of Nuts. I chose DMM because they’re Made in Wales, are high-quality, and are very light. And the complete set is fairly affordable, too.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/12653305435/" title="DMM Alloy Offset Nuts"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3739/12653305435_2189bba15c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="DMM Alloy Offset Nuts" /></a></p>

<h2 id="what-others-say">What Others Say</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.ukclimbing.com/gear/review.php?id=1066">UK Climbing</a> rates the Alloy Offsets as good (probably very good now that they’re “fixed”). The DMM Wallnuts received 4.68 out of 5 Stars at <a href="http://www.rockclimbing.com/gear/Essential_Equipment/Protection/Passive/Nuts_and_Stoppers/Wallnuts_5416.html">rockclimbing.com</a> and also the <a href="http://www.outdoorgearlab.com/Climbing-Nut-Reviews/DMM-Wallnut">Outdoor Gear Lab</a> rates them very high.</p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>If you’re planning to start Trad Climbing this year, you can not go wrong with set of DMM Wallnuts, Offset Nuts and Torque Nuts. While the latter is here in Finland not that often needed, a basic set of Nuts is THE key ingredient to your <em>Trad Rack™</em>. Getting the DMM Wallnuts and Offset Nuts gives you all the passive protection you’ll need to start practicing traditional climbing and lets you find out what you should get next. The DMM Nuts are high quality, lightweight, Made in Wales, and look pretty damn sweet. Though that’s only while they’re new, so go climbing &amp; get them scratched up!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>If you have a rope, you should have a rope bag</em> was what I was told on my lead climbing course earlier this spring. There’s some good reasons for that: It’s easier to transport your rope plus it stays clean &amp; sorted at the crag. I settled for the <a href="http://www.dmmclimbing.com/">DMM</a> Classic Rope Bag, which holds a lot more than just a rope, and is very comfortable to carry.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9172652567/" title="DMM Classic Rope Bag + Petzl Sirocco by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5473/9172652567_188bae6cd2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="DMM Classic Rope Bag + Petzl Sirocco" /></a></p>

<p>I’m a sucker for <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/marken/dmm/?_artperpage=96">DMM</a>’s high quality gear, so it was an easy decision to get their <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/dmm-classic-rope-bag/">Classic Rope bag</a>. Being a Finnish climbing association member I even got a nice 10% discount on the bag as I bought it at <a href="http://camu.fi/pages/kiipeily/kalliokiipeily/kaysipussit/classicropebaggreen.html">Camu</a> down in Helsinki. You can choose from four nice colours, and I settled for the green one. </p>

<p>The Classic Rope Bag can be worn as a backpack or over the shoulder. It’s very easy to transform the backpack into a shoulder pack (or the other way around) - one of the shoulder straps has two buckles which you undo and then connect to the two matching buckles which keep the main compartment compressed. Lemme walk you through it:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>&lt;a href=”http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/10208531396/” title=”DMM Classic Rope Bag</td>

      <td>Backpack”&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>That’s the pack in backpack mode. The left shoulder strap, as you can see, has a buckle on top and at the bottom. </p>

<em>Magic</em>. Nah, not really. The shoulder strap is now connected to the buckle which you saw in the above photo.</p>

<p><em>“Why would I need a backpack that can become a shoulder bag?”</em> you might be wondering. Well, for a sport climbing day at the crag you can fit your rope, harness, shoes, a set of QDs and water in there, as well as a Topo Guide - all you need. Then you can wear it in backpack mode to the crag. </p>

<p>However, if you want to go Trad climbing, you will need a tad more gear - cams, nuts, torque nuts, which all takes more space. In that case you can either stuff all that gear in the DMM Classic Rope Bag, as I do, and transform it into the shoulder bag and take an additional backpack along for other stuff - water, sandwiches, camera gear - and then you can carry both without problems. Because it’s a lot more comfortable to carry a backpack and a shoulder bag instead of two backpacks.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/10203094383/" title="DMM Classic Rope Bag by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5518/10203094383_96059dd427_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="DMM Classic Rope Bag" /></a>

<p>The tarp is a good size - 110 x 130 cm - and has four colour coded loops so the rope(s) stay in order, even twin/ half-ropes. Speaking of ropes, the bag can take a 80 m rope without problems with room to spare. I have used my 70 m <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/kletterseile/">rope</a> and all my trad gear in there. The tarp (and backpack) has a 1000 mm hydrostatic head, so keeps moisture and wetness away from the rope when the ground is wet.</p>

<p>Once you have climbed enough (does that ever happen?) and it’s time to go, packing is easy with the Classic Rope Bag: Fold the tarp with rope together, stuff it neatly into the bottom of the pack, add all your other gear, close the durable zipper, pull the compression straps tight, and <em>Voilá</em>, you’re ready to hike back. It looks like this:</p>

Close the zipper, pull the compression straps tight, go to the Pub and have a beer.</p>

<p>In case you don’t want to throw in your smartphone, keys and wallet in the main compartment, DMM has thought ahead and added a zippered valuables pocket. It will hold all your valuable and not so valuable stuff away from metal gear which might scratch it otherwise.</p>

<p>That’s it, really. There are plenty of <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/seiltaschen-seilpflege/">rope bags</a>, some are lighter, some are cheaper, sometimes you even can get a free one if you purchase a rope, but the durability, quality and ease of use of the DMM Classic Rope Bag are hard to beat. It comes at a good price, too. I’m really happy with it, and look forward to many years climbing with it. Two thumbs up.</p>

<p>You can buy one at <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/dmm-classic-rope-bag/">Bergfreunde</a>, <a href="http://camu.fi/pages/kiipeily/kalliokiipeily/kaysipussit/classicropebaggreen.html">Camu</a> and ask for it at <a href="http://bit.ly/Wi4tZS">Backcountry.com</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/131V0vk">CampSaver.com</a>. And now go climbing.</p>

<p><em>If you do a lot of Trad climbing, maybe consider waiting for the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/08/outdoor-news-iv.html">Vector trad pack</a>. It allows for easier trad gear organising!</em></p>

You go practice at the gym and on boulders, and then take it to the cliff. <a href="http://27crags.com/crags/havukallio">Havukallio</a>, close to Lahti is such a cliff. Top rope is a walk in the park compared to leading a sport or trad route. All goes well - until you fall.</p>

<p>It’s Friday night, ten past ten, and the sun is hiding behind clouds, but the ground, and more importantly, the rocks, are dry. Sami and I walk the narrow path to the cliff, between it and the field a ten meter wide strip of forest. We’re both the first time here, and both are immediately enchanted by the beauty of the place. Great routes catch our attention, and before we even pitch the shelters we take a look at the topo printouts and start identifying routes. </p>

<p>After we have our shelters up - I took the <a href="http://www.hyperlitemountaingear.com/hiking-climbing-shelters/mids/ulta-mid.html">Hyperlite Mountain Gear UltaMid</a> along to have plenty of covered space - we climbed up the cliff, and enjoyed the view. Rapeseed fields glow yellow in the dusk, while the birds sing around us, though the noise from the close by road disturbs this otherwise peaceful place. We identify anchors, try to guess to which routes they belong, and scramble the other path down. </p>

<p>It’s 23.30 as a group of eight pass us, inquiring in English about good spaces to pitch their tents. I show them a corner, and talk a bit more with Sami before I head back to the Mid with the intention to go sleeping. <em>“Please come and join us at the fire”</em> a woman invites me. I could lie awake under my quilt, or socialise. I pick the latter, and sit around the fire with the, as I find out, Estonian climbers who came for a climbing trip to Finland. We talk climbing, life, Estonia, Finland, Germany, and it’s past 2 when I finally climb in my bivy. A light shower around 4 wakes me up, but after I closed the door I go back to sleep and shall not wake up before 9 the next morning.</p>

<p>Sami and me make breakfast, and quickly settled on a route to warm up on this morning: <a href="http://27crags.com/crags/havukallio/routes/havuhormi">Havuhormi</a>, a 4+ Trad route seemed an easy enough route to start with. And so Sami leads it up, squeezes himself up through the crack and comes down again. I climb till the crack, collecting the gear, and then try to squeeze myself up. But it doesn’t work, I’m facing the wrong side, and can’t turn. So I get down again, belay Sami once more so he can collect the final pieces of gear, and then we move on. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9250655081/" title="070613_7124 by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7325/9250655081_d45f56aea4_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="070613_7124" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://27crags.com/crags/havukallio/routes/rakkauden-atollit">Rakkauden Atollit</a> is a 4 Trad Route, and again Sami leads and comes down. I climb it on top rope, the final move definitely is the crux, but it’s a fairly simple climb. I strap on my cams and nuts and set off. I set a couple of cams, and Sami laughs - <em>“You forgot to place that one nut!”</em>. Ah right. Well, gotta do with this cam now! I place a final nut and quickdraw before the crux and then top out. Well, that wasn’t too difficult! Full of adrenaline I come down - my first Trad Route! </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9250658349/" title="070613_7127 by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3821/9250658349_895bc270b0_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="070613_7127" /></a></p>

<p>The rest of our group have arrived by now, and more climbing commences. Everyone enjoys the superb climbing, be it sport, trad or top rope - good times are had. In the late afternoon a quick visit to the village of Hollola is made, to pick up water and a couple of beers - that’s definitely the cliffs short coming: No water source nearby. And on sunny 23°C days water is needed, plenty of it. After hydration is secured we return for more climbing, <a href="http://27crags.com/crags/havukallio/routes/kesan-lapsi">Kesän lapsi</a>, <a href="http://27crags.com/crags/havukallio/routes/cure">Cure</a> &amp; <a href="http://27crags.com/crags/havukallio/routes/vanha-vihtahousu">Vanha vihtahousu</a> are done, I try my luck on <a href="http://27crags.com/crags/havukallio/routes/nosso">Nössö</a> but can’t get more than a few meters of the ground. So it’s time to call it a day - over 10 hours surely are a good result for a day of climbing.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9253446710/" title="070613_7152 by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2820/9253446710_75711b3bee_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="070613_7152" /></a></p>

<p>We barbecue, share food, drinks, laugh and enjoy the beautiful atmosphere of Havukallio. It isn’t often that you can pitch your shelter right in front of the cliff. I pull the guy lines a bit tighter, inflate the <a href="http://bit.ly/15hIZlK">Klymit Inertia X Frame</a> a tad more, and slide into my bivy, happy after this good day.</p>

<p>Sunday at nine I awake. There isn’t much movement yet, except the other couple which also stayed here and who’re already having breakfast. I get up, put the <a href="http://www.traildesigns.com/stoves">Sidewinder 600</a> in Esbit mode and have a few minutes later my hot cup of coffee and müsli ready. Others fire up their stoves and soon we all enjoy our breakfast. On such a short approach - maybe 300 meters from car to the crag - I didn’t go completely SUL: A few bananas, apples and a blood orange came along, for a healthy diet.</p>

<p>Then Andreas and I set off again. I lead climbing Rakkauden Atollit again, build an anchor, and belay Andreas up. After he’s down we take a second rope along so we can build an top rope anchor for an unnamed route, rappelling down so we can reach the two anchor points. We both climb it successfully on top rope, and then need lunch before we will continue. Strengthened, we try each to lead on a sport route, but realise that this unlisted route is beyond us today, and so we move on. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9250646205/" title="070713_7092 by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3755/9250646205_2d66856144_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="070713_7092" /></a></p>

<p>I lead the sport route Vanha vihtahousu, which I climbed in minutes on top rope the previous day, and get sweaty in the hot sun. I manage, after a few falls and curses, to clip the anchor at the top of the slab, and Andreas again lowers me to the floor. More adrenaline goes through me, and we are waiting to try <a href="http://27crags.com/crags/havukallio/routes/kevathuuma">Keväthuuma</a>, which I would like to try to lead climb. There are plenty of people now at the crag, though, and so we spent much time waiting. After almost starting to pack up the route is free, and so I set off. It goes well, until I reach the ledge which goes up a chute. A rope is lowered directly down my route, and a guy appears above me. <em>“I’m just gonna rappel down where you are, then you can continue”</em> he calls down to me. </p>

<p>At 26°C in the sun on a ledge at about 15 meters height, I’m quickly starting to get thirsty. My mouth becomes dry like a desert, and I get a taste of how alpinists and Big Wall climbers must feel on climbs which are an enormous number larger than what I’m doing here. Finally the guy passes me by, and I start the chute up. Jamming gloves would have been useful, as I go up. I give it several attempts before reach crack where I can securely jam myself in. Trust in my abilities has disappeared by now. I’m thirsty, and feel this is beyond me right now - even if the top out is maybe just four, five meters away, and the terrain looks easy. I panic and tell Andreas I won’t make it. Sami and Timo get a rope and start the walk up. </p>

<p>Then, somehow, I decide to try once more. I don’t know where that sudden inspiration came from - maybe trust returned? It’s a mind game, after all. I hoist myself on the crack, there’s great hand and footholds, I place another <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/dmm-dragon-cam-friend-set-00-0-1.html">00 DMM Dragon Cam</a> and then, maybe 50 cm above it, a <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/dmm-offset-nuts-klemmkeile/">#7 DMM Offset Nut</a>. Clipped in. Save. It’s now just a slight traverse across the chute to the left, I place my hands, think that the hand holds are good, place my foot - and then things go too fast to recall.</p>

<p>I slammed rather unsoftly into the wall, the rope and the Offset Nut + Cam which I set just minutes earlier catching my fall. Three meters I fell down, I reckon. I’m destroyed. Andreas lets me down, and a few minutes later the rappel rope come down. I grab my Reverso, clip in, attach my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prusik">Prusik</a> with a screwgate ‘biner to a leg loop of my harness, and rappel myself down. Andreas, Anu and Sami are happy that I made it save to the ground. Battered, bruised the body, and also bruised is the ego. I was so close. I empty my <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/platypus-platy-plus-bottle-0-5l-push-pull-cap-brg-1.html">Platypus</a> and then drink two more litres, slowly getting my mind again together. That’s it then for today. The 4+ will have to wait for another day.</p>

<p>It’s easy to analyse this in retrospect. I probably should have top roped the route before leading it. I maybe shouldn’t have climbed the route that late in the day. I probably should have had something to drink with me. But I didn’t, and I still think it was a good decision. You learn from mistakes, and from mistakes like these you learn even better. I learned that my nut and cam placements were great. I learned that it’s not bad to fall on lead. I learned that maybe I should train the mind, as well as the body, more. And I learned that a group of friends, which have no problem to belay you for what seemed like a long time, and are happy to go rescue you, and then still go for a swim in a fine lake, are superb.</p>
