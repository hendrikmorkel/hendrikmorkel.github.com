<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8764705148/" title="Esbit stoves! by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8558/8764705148_ae7e04fee8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Esbit stoves!" /></a></p>

<p>The first time I used an Esbit stove was in 2004, when I was on a road trip to the Nordkapp in Norway with my brother. He gave me a <a href="http://bit.ly/10h5ZOV">Germany Army Esbit folding stove</a> earlier that year, and as we decided to travel to the most northern point of Europe I thought it might come in handy and took it along. We indeed used it on that trip, on a windy day down in a Fjord, and we tried to cook Ravioli in a can on it. We ate lukewarm and burned Ravioli that day, and since then I haven’t used Esbit that much. </p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8764854258/" title="052113_1281 by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8119/8764854258_7acf6ce429_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="052113_1281" /></a></p>

<p>It wasn’t until I started to lighten up that I was again using Esbit. My <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2009/09/gear-talk-trail-designs-ti-tri-inferno-stove-initial-review.html">Ti-Tri Caldera</a> came with the Gram Cracker Stove, <a href="http://www.traildesigns.com/">TrailDesign</a>’s super-light Esbit stove, and I gave it a few tries back then, but preferred wood as fuel (don’t need to carry it, abundant, doesn’t cost anything). I still carried some Esbit, though - as I wasn’t yet as proficient in starting a fire I always had an Esbit tablet as a back-up - it’s dead easy to lighten even on a windy and rainy day, and could be the difference between a cold and a hot meal. A tablet weighs 14 gram including packaging, so it’s a light and reliable back-up in my opinion (in winter I still carry a tablet or more depending on the length of the trip). </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8763117059/" title="052113_1322 by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2838/8763117059_f4011919f8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="052113_1322" /></a></p>

<p>It wasn’t until the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2012/09/ultralight-summit-daytrippin.html">Ultralight Summit</a> and seeing both Jotaro &amp; Tatsuya use a wonderfully light and easy setup which used Esbit as a fuel, that I became interested in it again. Back at home I started to do research, harassed Tatsuya to write a <a href="http://hikesinatra.blogspot.fi/2012/09/ul-summit-2012-at-julijske-alpsgear.html">blog post about his setup</a>, and sent an unreasonably high amount of Euros in exchange for 81 grams of Titanium to some Ultralight Outdoor Gear webshop in the UK. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bmp_creep/8698803903/" title="2012-08-03 12.50.05 by b.m.p., on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8539/8698803903_84fe00bc00_b.jpg" width="1024" height="679" alt="2012-08-03 12.50.05" /></a></p>

<p>After an equally unreasonable long amount of time the ultralight parcel of joy arrived at my door, and it was with much horror that I needed to realise that you can’t even trust an ultralight webshop anymore, as my <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/esbit-trockenbr-titan-kocher-faltbar.html">Esbit Ti-Wing stove</a> was a mighty 27% over the claimed weight - 14 g instead of 11 g it was supposed to be (further research has shown that these stove are usually 14 g and we’re being treated like dumb customers). After I recovered from this massive disappointment, which fellow ULers will certainly understand, I headed outdoors to have a cup of coffee to calm my nerves. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8763154531/" title="052113_1292 by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8117/8763154531_518da37277_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="052113_1292" /></a>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8764064489/" title="Coffee! by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3774/8764064489_e895b72899_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Coffee!" /></a></p>

<p>Living in a coastal town means we’re blessed with a stiff breeze all the time. You just don’t want to go outdoors with at least a windshirt, and you don’t want to use a stove without a windscreen either. So I rummaged through a box titled “<em>Kitchen Stuff</em>” to find a windscreen I could use with my new stove and pot. Happily the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2010/07/clikstand-first-look-video.html">Clikstand</a> had a suitable windscreen, and so I set off to boil myself with the 14 g stove a cup of hot water for a coffee. Despite that stiff breeze and the slightly oversized windscreen I was stirring the Starbucks Via coffee in my titanium cup with my titanium spoon six minutes later. After a few more minutes I had recovered from the <em>shock of the heavy stove</em> and was content about this easy setup; a stove, spork, windscreen, lighter and a few Esbit tablets fit without problems in the cup, which in turn fits well into one of the small cuben sacks I had lying around. A fine <a href="http://hrxxlight.com/">Gentlemen</a> even sent me some titanium foil so once I get around to it I could even make a lighter windscreen and a pot lid, making it even lighter and more efficient. </p>

<ul>
  <li>14 g Wing stove</li>
  <li>50 g pot</li>
  <li>21 g Clikstand windscreen</li>
  <li>04 g ZPacks cuben stuff sack</li>
  <li><strong>89 g TOTAL</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8766750758/" title="Boiling time 6:00 min by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2839/8766750758_d25a2efbed_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Boiling time 6:00 min" /></a></p>

<p>Then things started to happen quickly: <a href="http://litetrail.com/shop/">LiteTrail</a> presented the <a href="http://litetrail.com/shop/litetrail-titanium-solid-fuel-cook-system">Solid Fuel Cook System</a> which in the 2012 incarnation tips the scales at 84 gram. There’s a lot that speaks for the LiteTrail Esbit system: </p>

<ul>
  <li>It is a complete system so you don’t need to purchase different items at possibly different shops (it’s a pain in the butt to settle on the lightest Ti Cup with the best volume)</li>
  <li>The pot has a (heavy) lid</li>
  <li>It has a Ti windscreen and ground protector included</li>
  <li>It comes with a cuben stuff sack</li>
  <li>It is <strong>DAMN LIGHT</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Well, the post was fast for a change and one landed in front of my door in no time. I didn’t bother taking it in, but went straight out to boil some water for another coffee. Then it didn’t take long and plenty of snow, -20°C and darkness arrived. It’s wonderful how things sometimes conspire against me, but I deal with it. I sit tight, watch the moon, wait for the sun, and as soon as the snow is melted and the grass is still brown I head out to give it a run for its weight. And it is in spring just as fantastic as it was in the autumn.  </p>

<ul>
  <li>13 g Wing stove</li>
  <li>07 g Windscreen</li>
  <li>01 g Ground protector</li>
  <li>60 g 550 ml Ti pot (Lid 18 g)</li>
  <li>03 g Cuben stuff sack</li>
  <li><strong>84 g TOTAL</strong> (66 g without lid)</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8765610166/" title="052113_1304 by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8136/8765610166_3e7d6722ab_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="052113_1304" /></a>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8765574338/" title="052113_1296 by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3800/8765574338_a830bb894d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="052113_1296" /></a>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8765587924/" title="052113_1298 by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2849/8765587924_056e85ea9d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="052113_1298" /></a></p>

<p>Again, everything fits inside the pot, including a lighter, a foldable spork or a short spoon as well as three to five Esbit tablets. </p>

<p><em>But could it be lighter still?</em> I couldn’t help but wonder. Well, I’m happy to inform you that it is possible. The answer is the <a href="http://www.traildesigns.com/stoves/caldera-keg-gvp">Caldera Keg-GVP Stove System</a>. It’s what <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2009/11/interview-glen-van-peski-from-gossamer-gear.html">Glen Van Peski</a> uses. Once I started to explore Esbit stoves there was no way to not try it. </p>

<ul>
  <li>03 g Gram Cracker stove</li>
  <li>07 g Beer Band</li>
  <li>39 g Caldera Cone</li>
  <li>38 g Fosters can pot (Lid 07 g)</li>
  <li><strong>77 g TOTAL</strong> (70 g without lid, 63 g without Beer Band and lid)</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8765672964/" title="052113_1311 by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3777/8765672964_41d9ab89fc_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="052113_1311" /></a></p>

<p>As with the above systems, everything fits into the pot - or Fosters Can, in my case. Additionally also plenty of Esbit tablets, a Bic lighter, some Starbucks Via and a foldable spork fit inside, though unlike the two Ti pots above you need to be careful with the pot - but because you’re reading this I imagine you know how to take a bit care of your gear and don’t throw stuff around camp in a fit of anger because you again forgot your spoon. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8765644072/" title="052113_1307 by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2872/8765644072_1fb1cc03ae_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="052113_1307" /></a></p>

<p>The next revelation about Esbit came when I set out to bake a muffin with my <a href="http://flatcatgear.com/page3.php">Flat Cat Gear Bobcat system</a>. <a href="http://www.flatcatgear.com/">Flat Cat Gear</a> has an Esbit stove called Epicurean Classic, and it allows you to let a single tablet burn for 50+ minutes. That. Is. Awesome. </p>

<p>Let me repeat that, in case you overflew that sentence: <strong>MUFFINS!</strong> You can bake a <strong>muffin on the trail</strong>. Husbands, partners, guys, girls, take note: You want that your wife/ fiancée/ partner/ girlfriend/ boyfriend enjoys the outdoors just as much as you do? Then you want to bake muffins for dessert in the evenings, and a nice cake for breakfast (<em>you also will give your partner your most comfiest sleeping pad and warmest quilt, in case you didn’t know</em>). It’s a well-known fact that after eating muffins and cakes one is happy. Happy partner = more hiking together =)</p>

<p>The Flat Cat Gear stove is otherwise an outlier in this article as it is, ähem, not light. As in 382 gram for the whole setup. As in <em>You will carry that nevertheless to be able to cook muffins, cakes, and bread on the trail</em> - and to put things in perspective, it’s still 2/3 lighter than a Trangia. And it can make MUFFINS!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8765731976/" title="052113_1315 by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2818/8765731976_005b83a22e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="052113_1315" /></a></p>

<h2 id="musings-on-pots">Musings on pots</h2>

<p><em>What’s the right pot size? Does it need a handle? Does it need to be Titanium (Dumb question, of course it needs to be!)?</em></p>

<p>The Trangia generation might look in disbelief at you if you get out your 550 ml coffee cup at the camping ground and declare that your pot. But then you hiked 35 km today, saw the sunrise from the summit while the Trangia user had a in-depth look at his shoes and the trail for five hours. At least he has two pots and a pan, he might think*. Anyway.</p>

<p>Once you go light you most likely will look at ways to minimize the heaviest item in your pack: Food. Dehydrated meals save space and weight, and can be delicious. You also minimize the time used to prepare a dehydrated meal: Boil water, pour in bag, let it rehydrate, eat. To rehydrate a meal one needs usually between 250 - 400 ml of water, and the small cups above all fit that bill. The Evernew EBY-265 I bought has 400 ml volume, the LiteTrail pot 550 ml and the Trail Designs Keg 700 ml. With the Evernew you likely will need to boil two cups for a rehydrated dinner and a cup of coffee/ tea/ cacao, while with the Fosters Can one is sufficient - the LiteTrail one is in-between - it could be enough for drink &amp; food, or you might need to cook water twice.</p>

<p>With a 14 g Esbit tablet burning between 10 and 15 minutes, it has been enough for me to boil two servings of water on the smaller pots, or one Fosters can. </p>

<h2 id="accessoires">Accessoires</h2>

<p>The stove setups above aren’t everything you’ll need, so lets take a brief look at the other stuff:</p>

<ul>
  <li>18 g <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/sea-to-summit-folding-titanium-spoon.html">Foldable Spork</a><br /></li>
  <li>08 g <a href="http://litetrail.com/shop/cooking/litetrail-titanium-spoon-short-handle">Lite Trail Short Ti Spoon</a><br /></li>
  <li>12 g Long handled <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/sea-to-summit-alpha-light-cutlery-long-spoon/">Ti Spoon</a>/ <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/sea-to-summit-alpha-light-cutlery-long-spork/">Ti Spork</a><br /></li>
  <li>11 g Mini Bic lighter<br /></li>
  <li>06 g Matches<br /></li>
</ul>

<p>I eat from my cup/ pot or the freezer bag/ Ziploc directly, and also drink from it if I don’t take my Kuksa. It means if you want to eat from the cup you can’t drink a coffee from it at the same time, but with a bit of planning and thinking I’m sure you’ll cope. Or you take an extra cup =) A spoon, aka <em>the-most-forgotten-backpacking-item-EVER</em> is quite useful to eat, stir food and drinks, or even function as a pot handle. A lighter or matches make putting a Esbit tablet on a lot easier, apparently one could do it even with a firesteel (shaving a few bits of a corner and trying to ignite them) though if I use Esbit I do prefer one of the easy fire sources. The <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/optimus-titanium-faltbarer-spork/">Foldable Spork</a> is a great piece of kit because its <strong>a)</strong> a good length to eat from freezer bags and <strong>b)</strong> it folds so small that it fits in every of the above system - that minimizes the risk of going out without a spork!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8763866129/" title="Cooking Accessories by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5459/8763866129_2c23401bb0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="607" alt="Cooking Accessories" /></a></p>

<h2 id="the-end-is-near">The End (is near)</h2>

<p>As you can see, an Esbit stove setup allows you to go ultralight - or even SUL - with ease. It’s a very convenient fuel source, and despite some of its criticisms - some find it smells fishy, it can leave sticky residues on the pot, a bit of garbage from the tablets packaging - I think it is a superb way of cooking/ heating up water on the trail. The fuel is reasonably priced - <a href="http://bit.ly/19ZXfAS">Esbit tablets</a> cost between 4€ and $7 depending where you buy for twelve tabs - that’s an average price of $0.45 per tablet/ 1 l of hot water.</p>

<p><strong>Which SUL system to get?</strong> That’s a good question. You could go the MYOG route and pick the different components on your own to suit your specific needs. It shouldn’t be difficult to create a system that relies on an Esbit stove to stay under 100 gram total weight, but you most likely pay in that case also around $1 or more per gram. If the complete system route is what you’re after, get either the <a href="http://litetrail.com/shop/litetrail-titanium-solid-fuel-cook-system">Lite Trail Titanium Solid Fuel Cook System</a> or the <a href="http://www.traildesigns.com/stoves/caldera-keg-gvp">Trail Designs Caldera Keg-GVP Stove System</a>. The former has the benefit that you can use the pot also over a wood fire and it’s very durable, while the latter is lighter and larger volumne. The <a href="http://www.traildesigns.com/stoves/evernew-400ml-cup-sidewinder-ti-tri-bundle">Sidewinder</a> for the 400 ml cup is a combined solution of these two, btw.</p>

<p>You’re Esbit-curious but don’t know if it’s for you? Get a <a href="http://bit.ly/16M4WxN">Ti-Wing Stove</a> or <a href="http://briangreen.net/2011/11/titanium-foil-esbit-tray-stove.html">make your own</a>, add a box of <a href="http://bit.ly/19ZXfAS">Esbit tabs</a> and you’re set. This you can try with existing pots and cups, and see how it works for you. Another alternative is a <a href="http://www.traildesigns.com/stoves/evernew-600ml-ul-pot-sidewinder-ti-tri-bundle">Trail Designs Sidewinder system</a> in which you can try Esbit, but also alcohol and wood - that way you’re not “locked in” in case you find Esbit is just not your cup of tea.</p>

<p>After seeing how easy and convenient Esbit is, I’m giving it again a try. I love the tiny packsize of the whole system, the ease of use, and the simplicity. If you’re tired of hearing a noisy canister stove, leaking alcohol bottles, or that you smell like a wood fire, give Esbit a try.</p>

    <id>http://hikinginfinland.com/2012/02/primus-omnilite-ti</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There’s a new lightweight multifuel stove on the block, and it’s name is <a href="http://www.primus.eu/omnilite">Primus OmniFuel Ti</a>. Ti obviously stands for Titanium, the coveted UL material which is so dear to us ultralight backpackers. With two winter tours on the programme for me, one which will be solo and over a week, I thought it might be high-time to look into those stoves which are common among Polar Explorers.</p>

<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/36014308?byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ff0179" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>It arrived in the last week of January 2012. So far I had it out and tested it with gas (Video coming) and try to get out this week to test it with Primus PowerFuel in -24°C or more. I might try other fuels, though as I don’t have a car I rarely visit gasstations.</p>

<p><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/WEQDnf3uqGf0hfYNmyRp-BC7BOQfG_RQvqLIuOYHy8w?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-d6hUWBbjX5Q/TypSm018PgI/AAAAAAAAGG8/ehdix8qGKAI/s640/DSC02061.JPG" height="426" width="640" /></a></p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>It is a Multifuel Stove, which makes it a tool to produce boiling water for food &amp; drinks. However, Multifuel stoves have the advantage that they usually are excellent for very cold temperatures where other fuel sources are not working well, and that they can be used when travelling in different countries and it is unknown what fuel sources will be available - with a multifuel stove chances are that you will find one that works. The OmniLite Ti works with</p>

<ul>
  <li>Propane/ butane/ isobutane gas</li>
  <li>White Gas</li>
  <li>Vehicle fuel</li>
  <li>Kerosene</li>
  <li>Diesel</li>
</ul>

<p>So if you plan to do an around-the-world-trip, this stove certainly would have you covered (you also can rely on biomaterials for cooking). I got it less for an around-the-world-trip but more for its cold weather capabilities. Wood or gas are not very reliable at the low temperatures I am expecting on my trips, so a stove which can melt snow and boil water without much fuss is certainly not just a very comfortable solution, but at -25°C or more almost critical.</p>

<p><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/sBEW9UY5TBYo3wFuLq-9MxC7BOQfG_RQvqLIuOYHy8w?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-qH4Xui7K6lw/TypQDbouslI/AAAAAAAAGA4/51nD7gR9SSk/s640/DSC02072.JPG" height="426" width="640" /></a></p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>A stand/ pot support made of Titanium, which makes it lighter than the OmniFuel or other multifuel stoves. Optimized to work with Eta pots (so pots with them fins down on the bottom). It is equipped with a system called “Primus Wind Proof Burner” that adjusts the flame to wind condtitions, minimizing the chance that it goes out. The fuel line and pump have a self bleeding system to eliminate flares and spills. Absent from this list is a pre-heater (A tube which pre-heats the fuel which comes from the bottle/ cartridge over/ near the flame). This is interesting, and I will probably soon find out if this is a bad thing, or if this stove works just wine without one.</p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>It is made of Titanium. Not an innovation per se, though there’s not many Ti multifuel burners on the market, so this certainly makes it stand out. <br /><br />It is made to work with Eta Pots; that are those pots from Primus which allow for better fuel efficiency. I got their 2,1 litre pot with the stove, and will see if this is really the case (going to test it with a pot without the fins underneath).</p>

<p><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/UtIgIMzhoCiAke_XD7FmZRC7BOQfG_RQvqLIuOYHy8w?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-LgwvuMoZNe0/TypQaBJYkuI/AAAAAAAAGBo/dAEA8gFcPJk/s640/DSC02093.JPG" height="426" width="640" /></a></p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>It is very well made, lemme tell ya. It is Made in Estland, and the quality is superb. It radiates trustworthiness and durability.</p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>An important part! Lets see:</p>

<ul>
  <li>219 gram - Stove</li>
  <li>194 gram - Fuel bottle with pump</li>
  <li>090 gram - Titanium windscreen</li>
  <li>134 gram - Bag</li>
  <li>042 gram - Multitool</li>
  <li>413 gram for stove and (empty) bottle with pump installed</li>
</ul>

<p>You can leave the fuel bottle at home is you plan to use it only with cartridges. The benefit of such a stove versus e.g. the Jetboil Sol Ti is that you can invert the cartridge, as in low temperatures the gas solidifies and in a normal stove will sink to the bottom - if you can invert the cartridge that means it goes right to the hose and the burner. Of course you could build a small cozy for the cartridge to insulate it from the cold, though I am not certain how well this works in very cold temperatures.</p>

<p><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/2ayI8H6Rg9JkcwtLHkRBsBC7BOQfG_RQvqLIuOYHy8w?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-cJXrN4x4PQ8/TypQOwgoi-I/AAAAAAAAGBQ/eBljAjstB1A/s640/DSC02078.JPG" height="426" width="640" /></a></p>

<h2 id="sustainability">Sustainability</h2>

<p>It is the same question as with other gas/ multifuel stoves: The stoves themselves are fairly sustainable - I expect this stove will work for years to come - but it is the fuel it runs on which is not sustainable. The Primus PowerFuel comes in a plastic bottle (and it is made in the Netherlands) while the Primus Power Gas is Made in South Korea and comes in an Aluminium cartridge. Once empty, you need to buy a new one, and the fuels themselves also are not the most environmental friendly. The other fuels it can run on - diesel, gasoline and kerosene are in the same category, not very sustainable or environmentally friendly.</p>

<p>You’re in a hard place if you go winter backpacking and need a reliable fuel - you pretty much need to use one of the above or rely on wood, which might be very hard to get in some places and at -30°C or more can be difficult to work with. This is something to consider; though it is pretty much either one of the unsustainable fuels or melting snow with body heat and eating cold food (or make a wood fire if possible). <br /><br />It is made in Estland, which means at least for me it only had a short trip to arrive here.</p>

<h2 id="recyclability">Recyclability</h2>

<p>Looking at the stove unit, it consists of titanium, brass and steel, the hose is probably rubber and there’s a plastic knob. All of these materials can be recycled, digging them up takes quite a toll on the environment, though.</p>

<p><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/h5Rs_mibzv6x9dDTs8Q3bRC7BOQfG_RQvqLIuOYHy8w?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-IwqxAXoZ85U/TypQpktOd-I/AAAAAAAAGCQ/5UGicJSFmtg/s640/DSC02113.JPG" height="426" width="640" /></a></p>

<h2 id="competing-products">Competing Products</h2>

<p>Stoves compete with other stoves, as well as a good old fire. So besides the BushBuddy, Ti-Tri Caldera Cone, Backcountry Boiler, <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2011/09/jetboil-sol-ti.html" target="_blank">Jetboil Sol Ti</a>, Gnat and others, the main competition will be from other Multifuel Stoves. The lightest is the <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/mehrstoffkocher-soto-muka-benzinkocher.html">Soto Muka</a> (claimed weight of 160 gram, 200€, works with gasoline and white gas). A classic is the <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/mehrstoffkocher-msr-whisperlite-intern-combo-kocher.html">MSR Whisperlite</a> (claimed weight of 305 gram, 120€, works with different liquid fuels). The <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/mehrstoffkocher-optimus-nova-kocher.html">Optimus Nova</a> (claimed weight of 435 gram, 140€, burns liquid fuels) is another familiar name when looking for multifuel stoves.</p>

<h2 id="what-others-say">What Others Say</h2>

<p>Only <a href="http://www.tgomagazine.co.uk/news/gearnews/the-primus-omnilite-ti-stove-exclusive-first-review">Chris Townsend has reviewed it</a>, and he says <em>If you want a stove that can run on a variety of fuels this is one of the best around.</em> He seems not to have tested it in the cold, though.</p>

    <id>http://hikinginfinland.com/2011/09/jetboil-sol-ti</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Titanium. The chemical element with the symbol Ti and atomic number 22. A standard atomic weight of 47.867(1) and a hexagonal crystal structure, it is one of the finest elements the ultralight backpacker lusts after. <a href="http://bit.ly/1Ahwlnp">Jetboil</a> makes use of that fine material in order to produce the lightest, fastest and most efficient gas stove currently on the market. <a href="http://www.webtogs.co.uk/">Webtogs</a> asked me if I’d like to give the <a href="http://bit.ly/17csUUu">Jetboil Sol Ti</a> some proper usage in nordic &amp; arctic conditions. Looking for a good reason to try gas stoves yet again, and I having read a lot of positive stuff about Jetboil products in general I was delighted about the possibility to try this newest and lightest creation. Lets dive in this living review.</p>

<p><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/qt_Xk9k3j5UpGcwFLncDWQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-tximGAI1C5I/Tns6Xl4Jm_I/AAAAAAAAFXU/Fcg-3MWciS8/s640/_DSC2481.jpg" height="426" width="640" /></a></p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>I got the Sol Ti in mid August, and have so far only used it on day trips - this thus can be considered a rather detailed “first look”. I will update and annex the different sections over time.</p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>The Sol Ti is made to boil water. You can cook in it, but need to do so at the smallest flame possible and keep on stirring to minimize the risk of burning your food in the pot - personally I go for boiling water exclusively and pour it into a freezer bag for “cooking”. With that in mind, I can already say that the Sol Ti fulfills its function exquisitely, as it does boil water.</p>

<p><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/4Df5QyldgxS1uvv698PHfA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-DYre4nP0mhI/Tns6YEOLDmI/AAAAAAAAFXY/isxcBLjAn-4/s640/_DSC2483.jpg" height="426" width="640" /></a></p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>Light, compact, efficient, fast is what I’d say are the main features. Of those four fast is of the least concern to me, though I won’t dismiss the merit of a fast stove in inclement conditions. But generally speaking, two or four or six minutes makes in a normal situation not much of a difference to me. Compactness on the other hand is something I value immensely. Going light has for me also a lot to do  with decreasing the size of the gear, and this is where the Sol Ti really scores well. Being efficient means I don’t need to carry more canisters with me, and I should be able to get around 12 liters of boiling water out of one 100 gram canister - if I calculate with one liter a day (500 ml morning, 500 ml evening), this would mean twelve days before I run out of fuel. Not bad at all. And being light, obviously, is great.</p>

<p>Jetboil says the features are the pour spout and strainer, the secure &amp; easy pot connection, the fluxring, and the advanced igniter. Lets look at these in detail. A pour spout and strainer definitely are nice. They are both integrated into the lid, though - less of a deal with the strainer, but I feel a spout would have been nice as part of the pot itself - especially if once leaves the lid at home. I didn’t find any info online or in the instructions if the lid, made of a plastic of sorts, is BPA free, but <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jetboil/status/117264726966280193">Jetboil replied on Twitter</a> that all their plastic is BPA free.</p>

<p>The secure &amp; easy pot connection is secure, but I wouldn’t say easy. It ain’t difficult, but easy is something like the MSR Reactor where I just put the pot on the burner and <em>Voilá</em>. With the Sol Ti putting the pot on the burner means you need to align the cut-out on the pot with the small bump on the burner and push them together until it feels secure. After that it is safe and sound, and shouldn’t fall off even if the complete unit tips over. Getting the pot off the burner after you have boiled water in it is a bit fiddly, but not a major obstacle.</p>

<p>The Fluxring is a nice feature. It makes the Sol Ti very efficient - I used on average 4 grams of gas to boil 500 ml of water in under two minutes on my daytrips. I might try to compare it to a pot without a Fluxring to see how much efficiency it adds. The igniter also is a useful feature, as it means you don’t need to use your firesteel &amp; puukko, a lighter or matches to get it on fire.</p>

<p><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/vrDNlnUrvIRe4hIvu31_9Q?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-IwmX8IcEVuQ/Tns6bDytHXI/AAAAAAAAFXs/8hby3RHBzRg/s640/_DSC2488.jpg" height="426" width="640" /></a>
<a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/4PknXinLxleBabXOa_UMPw?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ky3t_Rp9Ki8/Tns6aakrjPI/AAAAAAAAFXo/XPANqZkU1jc/s640/_DSC2487.jpg" height="426" width="640" /></a></p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>No real innovations on the Sol Ti, if we don’t see minimizing weight to an absolute minimum as an innovation. Jetboil claims an “<i>Increased Cold Weather Performance</i>” - it not yet being anywhere close to 0°C I can not confirm that and it will need to wait till winter. The “Fluxring” is Jetboil’s version of a heat exchanger with a fancier (or more confusing) name. It is nothing new, though, and also <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/04/first-look-monatauk-gnat-video.html">stoves made of titanium</a> are hardly an innovation.</p>

<p><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/ungMBfz33YK5qdEy9AgxAQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-GQF2mlrcv-c/Tns6bsyL6-I/AAAAAAAAFXw/JQuhinzzdIY/s640/_DSC2489.jpg" height="426" width="640" /></a></p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>Overall quality is solid. The pot sleeve is not cut and sewn very clean, but it is more a cosmetic than a functional matter. The pot is nicely made, though some users have experienced the development of a white powder between the fluxring and the pot bottom (The fluxring is made of Aluminium, while the rest of the pot is made of titanium - this can create problems with corrosion, see “What Others Say”). The Burner unit has the orange plastic ring-support-thingy around it, which holds the Piezo ignition. The black ignition button has about a millimeter of movement in its hold, and also the cable, while firmly in place, could somehow get damaged. I imagine if the complete unit would have been made of Titanium of Aluminum and would be enclosed (much like the Reactor unit) it would probably be similarly light (now the stove seems to be made from steel, not titanium). However, this is serious nitpicking - it really is very well made, and I have no doubt that it will have a long life.</p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>Easily the most important bit on an ultralight blog!</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pot: 102 gram</li>
  <li>Pot lid: 18 gram</li>
  <li>Pot sleeve: 15 gram</li>
  <li>Pot support: 37 gram</li>
  <li>Pot bottom cup: 34 gram</li>
  <li>Burner unit: 104 gram</li>
  <li>Canister Tripod: 28 gram</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>TOTAL</strong>: 338 gram for everything.</p>

<p>A UL backpacker would leave the pot bottom cup (minus 34 g), the pot support if he doesn’t use some other pot (minus 37 gram) and the canister tripod (minus 28 gram) at home, and would ponder if he really needs the pot lid (which would save another 18 gram). That would mean he’d carry only the burner unit, the pot &amp; sleeve and the lid for a total of 239 gram. For a complete unit, if you want to be able to boil water fast &amp; convenient, surely a great setup. <br /><br /></p>

<h2 id="sustainability">Sustainability</h2>

<p>A look at the <a href="http://www.jetboil.com/">Jetboil website</a> shows there’s zero information on any sustainability efforts of the company. The Sol Ti itself is Made in China so will have quite a trip via ships, trucks, trains and plains behind it before it is in front of you. The packaging it comes in is compact and small, made of a clear PET plastic which can be (in Finland, don’t know how it is in your country) easily recycled. The papers and the packaging lack any information on if they’re printed on recycled/ FSC approved paper with soy inks et al. so it is save to think they’re most likely not. However, paper is easy to recycle in most countries.</p>

<h2 id="recyclability">Recyclability</h2>

<p>Aluminium and titanium can be recycled. However, Jetboil has no info on this, or a recycle system in place. You might be able to recycle your Sol Ti either via a scrapyard or, if it is still in good condition, sell it onwards or trade it at a service like Swap.com. Paper and packaging which come with it can be easily recycled (in Finland).</p>

<p>The big drawback of any gas stove is less the stove itself, but the gas canisters which are used. Now while Jetboil has a “Butane Canister Recycling Tool” I find this is just a mediocre solution. I still much more would prefer a refillable canister solution, which would save massive resources in terms of production, transportation and waste. However, I think JetBoil, Primus, SnowPeak and all other gas canister manufacturers are not interested in innovating and are happy with the rather poor status quo. Anyhow. The <a href="http://bit.ly/1CYBpR5">Crunch It tool</a> allows you to puncture butane canisters in a safe way and make them ready for recycling. It is a step in the right direction, though there are better solutions, as I outlined.</p>

<h2 id="competing-products">Competing Products</h2>

<p>Besides <a href="http://bit.ly/1zGKyaB">Jetboil’s own stoves</a> there’s a bunch of competeling products (practically every stove can be seen a competitor, but lets think systems here): The <a href="http://bit.ly/1xlQF7l">MSR Reactor</a> and <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/03/video-optimus-crux-lite-in-winter.html">Optimus Crux Lite</a> come to my mind, as they’re complete sets. If you open your mind a bit, then also the <a href="http://vimeo.com/22221272">Backcountry Boiler</a> and the <a href="http://www.traildesigns.com/stoves/caldera-sidewinder">Trail Designs Sidewinders</a> can be considered competing problems. </p>

<p>Of these I would consider the MSR Reactor the closest competitor. While being heavier it is has a higher volume (0,6 l for the Sol Ti versus 1,5 l for the Reactor) and is similarly efficient in its usage of gas and speed. I will do a video of them in the future to discuss them side-by-side; for now it is useful to point out similar systems.</p>

<p><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/isLCQzX5VQRvq-xCY2npkg?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-81kVF7t9TBw/Tns6dGg1EFI/AAAAAAAAFX8/BbSXMKtiQlY/s640/_DSC2493.jpg" height="426" width="640" /></a><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/MN_tnKNehwQUWXizLrKFBQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-4PPNUCpgq1I/Tns6daUYQLI/AAAAAAAAFYA/EPsHYtN-0wc/s640/_DSC2494.jpg" height="426" width="640" /></a></p>

<h2 id="what-others-say">What Others Say</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.nielsenbrownoutdoors.com/2011/08/gear-reflections-lapland-2011.html">Roger found the Sol Ti a star</a> on his Nordkalottleden trip. <a href="https://twitter.com/tramplite/status/115512562900148224">Colin</a> reports some corrosion on his Sol Ti after using it on the Colorado Trail. </p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>On my daytrips, many of them in inclement weather, I was very happy about the convenience and fast speed of the stove. All in all you can have a hot beverage in about four minutes from taking it out of your pack to a steaming hot cup of tea in your hand. I was equally impressed about the efficiency - four grams of gas for 500 ml is very good, more use will see if this a constant variable. I like the compact size, as I use an Osprey Raptor 18 for biking, and it has little space - but also on backpacking trips I’m certain that I will enjoy the compactness of this stove - it is 15 cm high and 11 cm in diameter. Besides some nitpicking I can’t find any serious negative with the burner itself - the price of ~150€ is high, but then you get a great piece of kit.</p>

<p>Looking further than the Sol Ti, I would wish to see efforts from Jetboil in the sustainability department - Jetboil can start easy by becoming a <a href="http://onepercentfortheplanet.org/en/">1% For The Planet</a> member, get a Environmental Management System in place and if they wanna go the extra mile consider Cradle-to-Cradle aspects in the design of its products.</p>

Since a while I have been using the <a href="http://www.clikstand.com/">Clikstand</a> system to brew my hot chocolate when on a evening or day walk. It reminds me very much of the Trangia, but does away with the massive weight of the Swedish system. I have two of their combos, the <a href="http://www.clikstand.com/p_combinations_titanium.html">Denali Titanium Combo</a> and the <a href="http://www.clikstand.com/p_combinations_ssteel.html">Sierra Combo</a> - the Denali being Titanium awesomeness and the Sierra being affordable stainless steel. <br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/boeLd8-spXXcGNyH7cE9aivoLD1Hlr9wZnl_cc9kSyA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TDcryTaPu0I/AAAAAAAAC4Y/xIRhHItdtRQ/s800/IMG_7856.jpg" /></a><br /><br />Before you read on, hit play and enjoy the video I made, in which I compare the two systems to each other:<br /><br /><object width="640" height="505"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/EXyWhfnU5Jo&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?color1=0xe1600f&amp;color2=0xfebd01" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/EXyWhfnU5Jo&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?color1=0xe1600f&amp;color2=0xfebd01" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="505" /></object><br /><br />The Denali Titanium Combo weights are as follows:<br /><br />258 g Total <br />055 g Clikstand T-2<br />021 g Windscreen T-2<br />035 g Evernew Titanium Burner<br />118 g Evernew Titanium Ultralight 900 ml pot (Pot 82 g, Lid 37 g)<br />022 g Stuffsack<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/0mBI4BBSzm0ogIVocDjpeivoLD1Hlr9wZnl_cc9kSyA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TDcr__B-PTI/AAAAAAAAC4c/GPTzO0G_V_w/s800/IMG_7871.jpg" /></a><br />The Denali Titanium Combo packed.<br /><br />The Denali is the top of the line set, everything made of high quality Titanium, and very high build quality. The whole set fits into the 900 ml pot. And the pot would be one item where I could see improvement - I'd like to see Evernew add a spout and holes into the lid, as they have in their pasta pots. Besides that, I believe this is as close to perfection as it is possible. Quality and perfection have their price, and the Denali Titanium Combo retails for $163,95. <br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/MzRoLvd6Vour4f32DbFhtCvoLD1Hlr9wZnl_cc9kSyA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TDcsevYqaLI/AAAAAAAAC4o/qeVL1Ob8iTU/s800/IMG_7835.jpg" /></a><br />Evernew Ti Burner in action.<br /><br />Lets thus have a look at the Sierra Combo and its weights:<br /><br />245 g Total<br />096 g Clikstand S-2<br />038 g Windscreen S-2<br />111 g Trangia Burner (Burner 67 g, Simmer Ring 24 g, Closing Cap 21 g)<br /><br />The Sierra Combo sells without a pot, thus adding for example the above Evernew 900 ml pot would bring the weight up to 363 g. That is about one third of the Trangia 25-3 UL set (though it has two pots and a pan) which I see as the direct competitor of the Sierra Set. Anyway, the Sierra Combo is 134 g heavier as the Titanium version - the Trangia burner alone weights as much as the Ti Clikstand, Windscreen and Burner! However, at $51,95 it is also over one third cheaper than the Ti cousin. <br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/jWGOm68A1U8pV8A3VXh_hCvoLD1Hlr9wZnl_cc9kSyA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TDcslGa1YVI/AAAAAAAAC4s/j0fw0PFT0fc/s800/IMG_7848.jpg" /></a><br />Trangia burner in action.<br /><br />I think both systems are great for the Lightweight and UL backpacker who are looking for a lighter kitchen setup. The advantages are that the parts can be bought separate, allowing the Trangia and Evernew Burner owners to just get the Clikstand and Windscreen of choice and keep on using the burner and pots they have. It is easier and more "normal" as some other UL cooking systems (beer cans ;), and a very stable system. Finally, the Trangia simmer ring allows you to actually cook and not only boil water. <br /><br />The Evernew Burner is a lot faster than the Trangia, needing about 5 minutes to bring 500 ml of cold water to a boil, whereas the Trangia needs about 7 minutes. However, the Evernew burns only 7,5 minutes with 30 ml of alcohol, whereas the Trangia goes on for 10 minutes with the same amount of alcohol. As I said in the video, if you only want to boil water as fast as possible to pour it in our freezer bag, go for the Evernew - it is the speed machine. If you like to cook and simmer in camp, go for the Trangia, which has the added benefit that you can transport unused alcohol in thanks to the closing cap.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/D3rBMRUIVQIM6KTLP7oSIyvoLD1Hlr9wZnl_cc9kSyA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TDcsxsGg_PI/AAAAAAAAC4w/Jn88T_CJVBY/s800/IMG_7862.jpg" /></a>
