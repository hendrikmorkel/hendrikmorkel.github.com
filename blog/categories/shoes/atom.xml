<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>I received the Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX over a year ago in November 2013. I climbed ice in Korouoma, Vaasa and <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/abisko-ice-climbing-festival-2014.html">Abisko</a> with them and was mountaineering in <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/07/arcteryx-alpine-academy-2014.html">Chamonix</a> and the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/mountaineering-and-climbing-in-the-polish-tatras.html">Polish Tatras</a>. All in all they have seen over four weeks of use and have been used for ice climbing, mountaineering and hiking.</p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>Again Ueli Steck has helped to develop this boot, and you can see it from the weight and the technical features. While the sock-gaiter-construction isn’t new I have not seen a lot of mountaineering boots which use it. The Y-Structure, KCN-Tech fabric and Re-Active AC XT sole stand out on this booth, as does the very good fit &amp; the light weight.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15889704852" title="Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7473/15889704852_aecafa05ca_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX" /></a></p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>The shoe is hand made in Italy and is from a quality point of view absolutely superb. The fit is impeccable and even after four weeks of hard use the boots still look like new. Only the reflective tape in the back of the shoe shoes some wear, otherwise boot and sole still look like new.</p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>773 g per boot in Size 42,5 or 1.546 g for the pair. </p>

<h2 id="sustainability--recyclability">Sustainability &amp; Recyclability</h2>

<p>The boots are hand made in Italy. If you have worn it out you could have it resoled at your local shoemaker or you can recycle it via your local recycling scheme.</p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p><strong>Ice &amp; Mixed climbing</strong> I did with the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/04/grivel-g20-crampons.html">Grivel G20 crampons</a> to the boot and it’s a fantastic combination. The G20 are 424 g per crampon which means one shoe &amp; boot are 1197 g, which is about 150 g lighter than with the Phantom Ultra boots on. This might seem trivial but feels like a big difference. What I enjoy most with the Rebel Ultra GTX is, however, the freedom of movement my feet have in them. I can pretty much fully move my feet like I could in a trailrunner, with the difference that I can connect a pair of crampons to them and climb ice with them. This is especially useful for mixed climbing, but also on more tricky ice climbs in narrow places this freedom of movement helps in better foot placements. The high sock works like a gaiter &amp; keeps water and snow out and the carbon insert makes the sole nicely rigid for climbing. In short, the climbing in them is great, I really loved the freedom of movement they gave me. </p>

<p>The last winter was super mild and I wasn’t able to test the boots in severe cold weather, but the -5°C I used them in, often while standing around on snow and ice, where no problem for them and I had warm feet and toes in the boots. When constantly moving one might be able to wear them in even colder temperatures, say to -10°C, but beyond that I reckon they will be not warm enough and it’s better to put a warmer boot on. One option that I haven’t tried is using an overboot with them in colder weather for a little bit of extra insulation, though I almost think that just using a warmer boot would be lighter - though less versatile.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15864534166" title="Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX in Chamonix by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7496/15864534166_7c1da26c08_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX in Chamonix" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Hiking</strong> in these boots is possible but really wasn’t something I liked. While they allow great freedom of movement they are lined boots, so walking from the Chalet to the Cable Car in Chamonix, a 15 minutes walk, was not enjoyable as it was +35°C in the valley, which meant I had super-sweaty feet by the time I arrived at the house. In the Tatras I hiked on two occasions with the Rebel Ultra GTX boots, once in warm weather which again was not good, and once in the pouring rain, where they were fine. I had moist feet &amp; boots after hiking four hours in the rain in them, but they were warm so it was OK. They did also dry almost completely over night. However, when I know I need to hike long distances in the summer I would always take my <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/luna-sandals-oso.html">Luna Sandals OSO</a> along for it, as I much prefer to hike in warm weather in them.</p>

<p><strong>Mountaineering</strong> in the Alps and Tatras I did most of the time with the <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/grivel-air-tech-new-matic-steigeisen/?pid=81">Grivel Air Tech New-Matic</a> (453 g per crampon) but I also tried the <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/camp-xlc-390-steigeisen/">CAMP XLC 390</a> (254 g incl. optional Antibot). The weight difference between these two crampons is almost 200 g so not trivial. I did climb more with the Grivel Air Tech New-Matics and do like them a lot, and these two crampons show that you can use the Rebel Ultra with either a plastic harness or a front bale. The light weight and freedom of movement of the boot of course are great for alpine climbs and the sole is sticky on rock and allows for precise foot placements. I still would switch to <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/06/scarpa-stix.html">climbing shoes</a> for more demanding/ technical climbs, but if it are easy routes you’re doing the Rebel Ultra GTX are more than capable. Add in good grip on snow &amp; ice and you have a very efficient mountaineering boot.</p>

<h2 id="competing-products">Competing Products</h2>

<p>The <a href="">Scarpa Phantom Ultra</a> is a warmer and heavier boot which might attract the same people who’re curious about the Rebel Ultra GTX. If we look at other brands the <a href="http://bit.ly/1xAiXwT">La Sportiva Trango Cube GTX</a> and the <a href="http://bit.ly/1AhNGww">La Sportiva Batura 2.0 GTX</a> are both lightweight mountaineering boots which can be used for the same activities as the Rebel Ultra GTX.</p>

<h2 id="could-be-better">Could be better</h2>

<p>I’m hard-pressed to come up with something that could be better in this boot. I am sure Scarpa and Ueli had their reasons to use Gore-Tex® instead of OutDry® for this shoe, personally I feel OutDry® is slightly better at keeping moisture out, dries faster and breathes better, but I think the Gore-Tex® lining does a good job in this boot. So really nothing to complain.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15890337425" title="Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX with Grivel G20 Crampons attached by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7497/15890337425_9735b0f75f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX with Grivel G20 Crampons attached" /></a></p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>The Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX is a beautiful <em>and</em> ultralight mountaineering boot that is excellent for early and late season ice &amp; mixed climbing and summer mountaineering. It keeps your feet &amp; toes warm till at least -5°C even if you’re just standing around in the snow or hang in the belay, and with the Vibram® sole it is also well suited for easy alpine climbs. I think if you look to up your ice, mixed and alpine climbing by shedding weight and going lighter the Rebel Ultra GTX is the right boot for you. I love my pair and am always happy to put them on, because I know a good day in the outdoors lies ahead of me with them on my feet.</p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>I picked up my pair of <a href="https://lunasandals.refersion.com/c/8168e">OSO sandals</a> in Munich as I was visiting the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/02/ispo-news-2014.html">ISPO</a> and have worn them on the trail in Luxembourg and Poland, on the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/outdoor-fair-2014/">OutDoor 2014</a> and pretty much the last three months every day in Finland.</p>

<p>They’re sandals, so they’re, like, made for having cool feet. Minimal walking. Protecting your soft feet from sharp bits and stuff.</p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>Sandals and innovations, right? Right. If you saw the features above you quickly will see some things which you likely haven’t read before. The MGT footbed, the ATS laces and the Tech Straps are all innovations when it comes to sandals, or then Barefoot Ted just paid close attention to how the Tarahumara indians made their sandals, and improved a bit on those with modern materials. </p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>These sandals are hand-made by monkeys in Seattle, USA. I couldn’t find any fault with them, and I looked close. And walked a lot in them. They’re high-quality sandals. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14944316186" title="Luna Sandals OSO by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3870/14944316186_5c1816b038_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Luna Sandals OSO" /></a></p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>The OSO is the heaviest Luna Sandal available and my pair in Size 43,5 weighs 412 g or 206 g for one sandal. The Tech Straps (two) add 18 g to the pair.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14780605729" title="Luna Sandals OSO and Tech Strap by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3901/14780605729_6d146ba843_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Luna Sandals OSO and Tech Strap" /></a></p>

<h2 id="sustainability--recyclability">Sustainability &amp; Recyclability</h2>

<p>Ah well, sandals are shoes. Here in Finland they go into the rubbish bin nowadays and are burned for energy. If the sole is still good you could probably just try to order a new ATS system and rig it yourself, if that was what was broken. And if the sole is walked through, maybe get your shoe maker apply a new one? Or then you really could just put them in the trash and start to walk barefoot.</p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p>I settled on the OSO because both <a href="http://hrxxlight.com/">Benjamin</a> and <a href="http://www.infiniteoutdoors.blogspot.de/">Marius</a> had them and liked them. And if those young men can walk in a pair of sandals in the mountains then the strapping young lad that is the author of this website most surely also could walk in them. Should. Would. And thus walking in the mountains with sandals he did.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14957855962" title="Luna Sandals OSO by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5572/14957855962_5c0eb7db3a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Luna Sandals OSO" /></a></p>

<p>In the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/lake-district/">Lake District</a> I wished I would have taken the OSOs along. On the Escapardenne Trail I did and hiked 85 km of it in them. And in <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/07/back-from-the-polish-tatras.html">Poland</a> I hiked five out of seven days in them, much to the surprise of the Mountain Guide I was walking with. Minimal footwear is still an unusual view in the mountains and hills, and a pair of sandals at 2000+ m most certainly has people turn their heads. Which might be dangerous for them if they’re walking on a narrow ridge.</p>

<p>First you will need to learn to walk in them correctly. Walk wrong in these sandals - with your heel first as you might have learned by using high drop, thickly cushioned shoes - and you will get pain. Pain in the heel, knees and your back. The strap will pull uncomfortably into the front of your foot and hurt the top of it. After having used some cushioned shoes I switched into the OSO and walked wrong for a while and quickly experienced that pain. I realized that I walked wrong, and by walking as nature intended the human body to walk - the front first - the pain eased and walking became a pleasure. So much that I have barely used any other shoe in the past three months. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14550172205" title="Luna Sandals OSO by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3855/14550172205_4436dd8d70_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Luna Sandals OSO" /></a></p>

<p>Lets talk a bit about the construction of the OSO. The toe webbing is soft and comfortable and will mould to the space between your toes after a few days of wearing them. At the beginning it was something to get used to, but nowadays I don’t even realize that I have the sandal on and that there’s some webbing between my toes. Much of that has to do with the ATS strap which really is what makes a Luna Sandal a Luna Sandal in my opinion. This is a super-smart system. When they’re new you once need to sit down, fiddle around with the buckle and strap to get it to fit your foot just right, and then that was that. Unlike other Luna Sandals the ATS in the OSO is not elastic so you need to pull it a bit to slip it over your heel, but then it sits there. There’s a MGT rubber lining on the inside of the heel part which helps to keep the strap in place. The same MGT material is on the top webbing before the buckle, with the same comfortable effect. By the way: The whole strap really is just one piece of webbing with a buckle &amp; the plug, which are threaded through the sole and buckle to keep it connected to your foot.</p>

<p>If you go running in the OSO, and it’s perfectly capable of that, then I found the Tech Strap a good Add-on. It is included with the OSO and really is just a Velcro strap that helps to keep your heel strap and ankle secure. While this might sound trivial, it makes the OSO a completely different sandal. With the Tech Strap on the sandal is glued to your foot, no slipping, nothing. It’s just as easy to put the sandal on - it’s still slip-on-and-off-able - as the Tech Strap is just a Velcro strap but makes a world of difference. If you run and like the sandal to be glued to your foot, then you’ll love the Tech Strap.</p>

<p>So running. Trailrunning, really, because running on asphalt still sucks in my opinion. During the winter I ran in a different pair of shoes each day, and I looked forward to the Luna Sandals days. Sure, running on snow at -5°C is a bit fresh, but with a pair of <a href="http://bit.ly/VBOBYP">Injinji Toesocks</a> it’s just fine. You generate a lot of heat when running, so the feet were never cold. The OSO had superb grip on the snow and ice, which surprised me. The OSO kept on surprising me as I was hiking in Luxembourg on the Escapardenne Eisleck Trail, where it rained every day and I was hiking up some slippery, muddy hills. But like a bear the OSO just had grip and didn’t slip. Neither did my foot, thanks to the really grippy MGT footbed.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14955105781" title="Luna Sandals OSO by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5572/14955105781_9bd2a982e0_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Luna Sandals OSO" /></a></p>

<p>While my feet got wet and a bit dirty when it rained, they got a nice tan from the sunshine which we had in Finland the last months, including an ATS mark =) I already mentioned the Injinji Toesocks, which are nice on cool evenings or if it’s very windy &amp; rainy or you’re running on snow.</p>

<p>So yeah. The Luna Sandals are my de-facto everyday shoes since about May. Foodshopping. Going to the crag. Travelling. Visiting Fairs. Going to eat ice at the beach. Even now that it gets cooler I still slip into my OSOs when I go out, be it to pick up the Newspaper or going somewhere. Cycling. In the rain. Sunshine. On sand. Gravel. Asphalt. </p>

<h2 id="competing-products">Competing Products</h2>

<p>If we look at Minimalistic Sandals I’m only aware of <a href="http://bedrocksandals.com/">Bedrock Sandals</a> which have a slight variation on the toe webbing but otherwise are fairly similar to Luna Sandals. There’s a bunch of “traditional” <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/outdoor-sandalen/fuer--maenner/">hiking sandals</a> but honestly, these can not compare with Luna Sandals and are pretty heavy.</p>

<h2 id="what-could-be-better">What Could Be Better</h2>

<p>As they’re hand-made there can be bits of yarn standing over where things were sewn together, and that was what I had with my sandals. I called to Luna Sandals and asked what to do, and the solution to this was to singe the yarns briefly with a lighter to burn off the over-standing yarn or fabric. Done and never had a problem again.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14957855372" title="Luna Sandals OSO by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5564/14957855372_4e0b2a6310_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Luna Sandals OSO" /></a></p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>To get back to the intro and elaborate a bit further, as I did to <a href="http://www.vincentkleine.com/">Vincent</a>: The Luna Sandals are one of my favourite bits of kit because they’re simple. They’re comfy. They’re light. They communicate to anyone who see me in them that I like it minimalistic. Going back to nature. Feeling the ground, the air, the mud &amp; rain on my feet. But also the sunshine. Cool breezes on hot summer days. </p>

<p>Sweaty feet are a thing of the past if you wear Luna Sandals. At the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/07/arcteryx-alpine-academy-2014.html">Arc’teryx Alpine Academy 2014</a> I was wearing another favourite pair of shoes which are awesome up high and when it’s cold (more on those soon), but down in the summery 35°C of Chamonix they were too hot. Way too hot. And I was happy indeed that I had my Luna Sandals along. Comfy, cool feet down in the valley.</p>

<p>To conclude this wee review: If you want to take the next step in terms of minimal footwear for hiking, backpacking, packrafting and everyday-life and you have a healthy, natural fore-foot stride, get a pair of Luna Sandals. The OSO, which by the way means bear in Español, is a superb, hand-crafted sandal that allows you to experience the nature much closer than in a closed trail running shoe, or God forbid, a boot. It’s a beautiful sandal that once you’ve put it on you will forget is there, and you can concentrate just on the trail ahead, and the hiking, wherever it may lead you.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-buy-your-sandals">Where to buy your Sandals</h2>

<p>You can buy your Luna Sandals from <a href="http://luna-sandals.de/">Luna-Sandals.de</a> and <a href="http://www.racelite.de/luna-oso.html">Racelite</a> in Germany, <a href="http://www.fastway.fi/category/8/luna-sandals">Fastway</a> in Finland, <a href="http://moonlight-gear.com/?pid=44256135">Moonlight Gear</a> in Japan and of course at <a href="https://lunasandals.refersion.com/c/8168e">Luna Sandals</a> in the USA and else where on this globe. Be sure to read up on the sizing on their website and print out the template to find the right size!</p>

<p>The accompanying book is “<a href="http://amzn.to/1pEbB5d">Born to Run</a>” and you might want to order that at the same time to get into the mood &amp; mind-set. If you are unsure about hiking barefoot but want to give these sandals a try, order a pair of <a href="http://bit.ly/1thAkNq">Injinji</a> <a href="http://bit.ly/1BwIrKM">Toesocks</a> which help to protect your feet a bit more.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Climbing shoes. Like other <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/shoes/">shoes</a> they can be a source of much discussion. The <a href="http://www.scarpa.net/en/stix.html">Scarpa Stix</a> was popular long before I started climbing, was shelved and now makes a return - and it’s easy to feel when climbing with it why this shoe was and is so popular.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14359890633" title="Scarpa Stix by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3857/14359890633_7b1bf6b62b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Scarpa Stix" /></a></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I like Scarpa’s climbing shoes. The <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2011/08/ultralight-climbing.html">Feroce</a> still gets regularly used on rock and plastic, though since I got the Stix late in 2013 it has been my climbing shoe of choice. There’s much to like about the shoe: There’s the weight of just 402 g for the pair in Size 41, the sticky rubber and the precise feel. One thing which really rules for me is that they’re quick and easy to put on and take off. With the Feroce I had three Velcro straps to open and close and the <a href="http://www.scarpa.net/en/techno-x.html">Techno X</a> uses laces. The Stix uses neither - it’s a slipper that hugs my foot for a wonderful snug fit without being constricting or uncomfortable. In case you’re wondering if it easy to lose the shoe - for example when heel or toe hooking: Nope, no chance. The Stix fits like a glove and doesn’t budge.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14153208177" title="Scarpa Stix by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3914/14153208177_215c9320e1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Scarpa Stix" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14153085520" title="Scarpa Stix by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5477/14153085520_d4f50c85cd_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Scarpa Stix" /></a></p>

<p>Much of that superb fit can be attributed to Heinz Mariacher who designed the Stix - a name very closely connected to high-quality climbing shoes. And this shoe does pack a few high-quality features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <em>Vibram® XS Grip 2</em> sole gives grip on rock and plastic alike</li>
  <li>The <em>X-Tension Randing</em> cradles your foot and heel to enhance your toe power</li>
  <li><em>REB - Reinforced Elastic Band</em> are the blue stripes on top of the shoe which improve the fit of the shoe</li>
  <li>Superb craftsmanship and construction</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14316563156" title="Scarpa Stix by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5526/14316563156_2cb639dd93_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Scarpa Stix" /></a></p>

<p>But back to fit for a moment. Once you slip into the shoe, which is easy thanks to the two large tabs at the back and the one on the instep, your large toe right away finds its spot, with the other toes falling in line. While the rubber isn’t super thin, it’s thin enough for a precise feeling of the rock underneath: With the pointy toe box you’ll find pockets without problems, while on tiny ledges you feel like you can reliably and safely weigh down on your foot and know that it will stick. If you prefer slabs (and I really do!) or the climb just has no footholds you will be glad to hear that it’s a fine shoe for smearing. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14153076640" title="Scarpa Stix by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2913/14153076640_520b2ace9f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Scarpa Stix" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14336362111" title="Scarpa Stix by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3864/14336362111_e3dbfb6566_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Scarpa Stix" /></a></p>

<p>Which brings us to toe and heel hooking. I like Scarpa shoes because they fit me so well - it sometimes feels like they were designed for my feet - and the heel cup on the Stix is no difference here. A narrow, hugging heel cup without any dead space makes it easy to do precise heel hooks, with sticky rubber going far up the heel on all sides for extra friction. Toe hooks are similar: Because of the great fit for all my toes and the rubber on top it’s comfy &amp; easy to hook with the shoe. As it’s fast to put on &amp; off it’s easy to take the shoes off between pitches or when taking a break from a boulder problem. Even on hot, sunny days the shoe is comfortable to wear and does not create hot spots or overly sweaty feet. </p>

<p>The Stix is reasonably priced for such a high-quality shoe, and using it now since five months a couple of times a week on rock and plastic it feels like they still have a lot of climbing left in them. If you’re in the market for new climbing shoes and Scarpa’s shoes fit your feet well, I’d highly encourage you to try the Stix if you’re bouldering and sports climbing. It’s a highly comfortable shoe which is lightweight with great sensitivity and support that offers grip on narrow ledges, tiny pockets and lets you walk up steep slabs in comfort.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Approach shoes are what climbers wear when approaching a crag, but this sort of shoe is becoming more popular as a footwear choice amongst backpackers and hikers, too. After having used the <a href="http://www.salewa.eu/">Salewa</a> Wildfire in both it’s GTX and unlined version for hundreds of kilometres the verdict is out.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/12983871004/" title="Salewa Wildfire GTX &amp; Salewa Wildfire by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7418/12983871004_5fa773a2c4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Salewa Wildfire GTX &amp; Salewa Wildfire" /></a></p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.salewa.eu/product/tech+approach/wildfire+gore-tex+man">Salewa Wildfire GTX</a> arrived with me in the end of the winter of 2013, while I picked up the unlined <a href="http://www.salewa.com/product/footwear/wildfire+man">Wildfire</a> version at the OutDoor. Both have been on several trips in the Alps, Germany, Sweden and Finland. Overall I estimate the GTX version have seen around 500 km of use, while the unlined Wildfires have seen a bit more than half of that.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/12984685694/" title="Salewa Wildfire by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7332/12984685694_97b3ddbd21_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Salewa Wildfire" /></a></p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>An approach shoe’s function is to bring you safely up to the start of your climb, where you change into your climbing shoes and start climbing. They’re made for scrambling, and can be tied pretty tight, so that you have a tight fit on more demanding scrambles. Finally, they also help to make a statement in public that you’re a climber =)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/12984401983/" title="Salewa Wildfire by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3518/12984401983_31d36aef08_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Salewa Wildfire" /></a></p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>Salewa packed a whole lotta featuers into this shoe, which is in their <a href="http://www.salewa.eu/footwear/tech%20approach">Tech Approach Line</a>, where you also find the <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/salewa-firetail-approachschuhe/">Firetail</a>. </p>

<ul>
  <li>3F SYSTEM EVO, which offers freedom of movement and support</li>
  <li>CLIMBING LACING gives accurate lacing in the toe area </li>
  <li>MFF+ MULTI-FIT FOOTBED gives you the ability to adjust the footbed of your shoe</li>
  <li>SILVERIZED for non-smelly shoes</li>
</ul>

<p>Salewa recommends these shoes for <em>Via Ferrata, Hiking, Mountain inspired urban lifestyle and Approach</em>. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/12983865344/" title="Salewa Wildfire by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2033/12983865344_54398d6579_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Salewa Wildfire" /></a></p>

<h2 id="fit">Fit</h2>

<p>Out of the box they fitted me well, and something interesting that was included in the box were two more insoles (for a total of four yellow ones and two black ones). The black part connects via Velcros to the yellow insole. That way you can add more cushioning  &amp; volume in the heel and front, to suit your needs. Me, I didn’t see a need for it and have used them with low volume insole they came with. The toe box is reasonably wide, so for people who like that there’s enough space for their toes without them being jammed together, this shoe will be a good choice. Also the heel cup has a good fit, and tightens when you lace up the shoe.</p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>The above mentioned MFF+ Footbed system is a pretty interesting solution which lets the user adapt the shoe’s insole to his need, and you’re thus able to make them fit better. It’s a smart way as in this way Salewa can make one shoe and with the insole you can adopt it to your needs. </p>

<p>The Salewa EXA shell technology is basically a plastic grid on top of the mesh, which helps to protect it while still being flexible. It adds protection to the shoe and makes it more durable.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/12986019963/" title="Salewa Wildfire MFF+ Footbed by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7419/12986019963_3748452f1b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Salewa Wildfire MFF+ Footbed" /></a></p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>The quality is very good. Salewa are an old Italian company with a long tradition in making gear for use in the mountains, and their athletes help develop their gear. I have put these shoes through a lot of walking on asphalt and the Vibram sole still looks almost like new. Also the uppers have been through rock fields, on scrambles and hikes, and have not much to show for it except those splatters of mud which I didn’t want to clean (gives them a more authentic look, ya see!). </p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>They’re heavier than <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/shoes/">shoes I usually wear</a>, but I was curious to see if approach shoes work for me. They do feel heavier, but not too bad.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Wildfire GTX 888 g for the pair in EU Size 42,5 or 444 g per shoe</p>
  </li>

  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sustainability--recyclability">Sustainability &amp; Recyclability</h2>

<p>Salewa has a <a href="http://www.salewa.eu/csr">CSR</a> page and their 2013 CSR Report can be read <a href="http://csr.oberalp.com/">online</a>. The company is member of the <a href="http://www.salewa.eu/csr/fairwear%20foundation%20(fwf)">Fairwear Foundation</a> and is working on becoming greener, like much of our industry. As for the shoes, the easiest way for you to recycle them is to drop them in a shoe/ garment recycling bin in your town. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/12983433815/" title="Salewa Wildfire by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3380/12983433815_29f580ddf0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Salewa Wildfire" /></a></p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p>Alrighty then, the most important part. I started wearing the Wildfire GTX in the end of the winter of 2013, and they quickly became a shoe I wore when walking with my son, cycling to work, doing day hikes and walking to the grocery store. The GTX version, as well as the unlined version, are - at least in black - pretty warm shoes, so after a day walking in hot weather expect to have very sweaty feet. I find them in warm weather unbearable hot and will not wear them in temps above 20°C as they’re just too hot for me. For winter they’re very good, as you can wear them with mid-weight socks and still have toasty feet.</p>

<p>I wore them on my <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/07/sul-in-the-swiss-alps.html">Swiss SUL trip</a> and while they were fine, I more than once wished I would be wearing a shoe with more grip. While the Vibram Tech Approach EVO sole is durable, I don’t find it has as much grip as other soles and as it’s stiff it also does not let you feel the underground very well. The lugs on the sole are narrow and tight together, which became especially evident when crossing frozen snow fields high up. Where e.g. the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/04/salomon-speedcross-3.html">Salomon Speedcross 3</a>’s lugs dig into the snow and give you a save grip, the Wildfires were a bit sketchy. Also on gravel and wet surfaces they don’t offer as much grip as competing shoes. On the plus side, the sole is very durable and shows little signs of wear, and because it is so stiff it’s a good shoe to cycle in, too.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/12984258655/" title="Salewa Wildfire by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7375/12984258655_36f77a4412_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Salewa Wildfire" /></a></p>

<p>Speaking of cycling, while the shoes weren’t made for biking, the sole stuck pretty well to the pedals on my bike and the stiff sole was good for power transmission when riding. For walking I would wish that the sole would be more flexible - it barely flexes - which makes a natural stride more difficult (but not impossible). Both versions, but especially the GTX version, are also great on windy days or when you ride fast as you won’t get cold feet. </p>

<p>The weight of the shoes is higher than what I’d normally wear, but it’s not too bad. For the increase in weight you get a more durable shoe, though I think Salewa should remove some of the lining to <strong>a)</strong> make the shoe less warm and <strong>b)</strong> make it lighter. Especially the GTX version would benefit immensely from that, and I think if the shoes could be pushed down to sub 400 g per shoe they’d very popular amongst hikers that look for a durable shoe.</p>

<p>The 3F System Evo technology which is employed in the shoe, which is supposed to support and offer freedom of movement, well it’s in a shoe like this a given. I can see why the technology would be useful in boots, but in low shoes it feels a bit like they’re just slapping another label on top. It helps with a good heel-fit, though, if that’s something you’re looking for in a shoe.</p>

<p>Climbing in the shoes is OK. I personally rather slip into my <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2011/08/ultralight-climbing.html">climbing shoes</a>, but for scrambles on hikes, approaching the crag, and easy climbs they’re good. Keep in mind that you won’t have as much control and feeling in them as in a pair of climbing shoes. Finally, the shoes look pretty good and I often wear them to the city with my <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2012/02/outlier-woolback-og.html">Outlier pants</a>, which makes for a smart, casual look but you still can go for a scramble if the need arises.</p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>I have used the Salewa Wildfires pretty much daily since they arrived, and have walked on two outdoor fairs with them. The main reason for that is that walking on my trailrunning shoes in the city eats up their sole at an alarming rate, and to save my wallet the Salewa Wildfire with their very durable Vibram sole are an excellent alternative, and I’m still ready for the trail or a scramble. They work well for hiking and I think for people that are transitioning from boots to lightweight footwear these are prime candidates to try. They combine the benefits of boots - durability and a stiff-ish sole - with the benefits of trailrunners: light weight, strengthening the foot muscles and allowing for a more natural movement.</p>

<p>If you’re an ultralight backpacker these might not be the shoes for you, unless you spend a lot of time hiking on rock which naturally eats up rubber pretty fast. Also if you’re on a budget and don’t want to buy more than a pair of shoes a year, these are a good choice for you. On the other hand, if you’re a climber who looks for a new pair of approach shoes, or are a backpacker transitioning to lightweight footwear, then these should be on the top of your list. The are durable, light, look pretty fetching (especially in green!) and work also well in the city. </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.inov-8.com/New/Global/Product-View-Trailroc-235-Aqua-Lime-Red.html?L=26&amp;A=Trail&amp;G=Male">inov-8 TrailRoc 235</a> is a minimalistic trail shoe which gives you plenty of grip while being very lightweight. An excellent choice for those who want to try barefoot shoes for hiking and trail-running, the TrailRoc 235 features the new Tri-C Sole and has a fairly wide toebox. <em>A living review.</em></p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>The TrailRoc 235 arrived in August and have been worn pretty exactly for</p>

<ul>
  <li>45 backpacking km </li>
  <li>42,2 trail marathon km</li>
  <li>115 backpacking km</li>
  <li>20 urban asphalt km</li>
</ul>

<p>So a tad over 220 km (<a href="http://www.moves-app.com/">Moves App</a> is pretty nifty) over 14 days. Unlike other shoes I decided to exclusively use the TrailRoc 235 for backpacking and trailrunning, and not for e.g. walking to the supermarket and cycling =)</p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>A shoes function is to protect you from, like, stepping on sharp stones with bare feet. Or bumping your toes into roots on the trail. They give you grip on wet, muddy slopes. So grip and protection is its job, which the TrailRoc 235 does very well.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/10534482115/" title="inov-8 TrailRoc 235 Sole by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3748/10534482115_0fdbd1e79b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="inov-8 TrailRoc 235 Sole" /></a></p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Meta-Flex - a groove in the forefoot that provides a natural flex point in the shoe, allowing the forefoot to function naturally with each step</li>
  <li>Tri-C: Three sticky rubber compounds in different hardness give optimal wear and maximum grip on dry and loose trails</li>
  <li>5-finger polymer Meta-Shank™ </li>
  <li>6 mm Footbed</li>
  <li>Zero Drop</li>
  <li>Natural Fit</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fit">Fit</h2>

<p>inov-8 shoes fit me perfectly. As I said before, it’s difficult to judge fit - as your feet are different than mine. They have, what I find, a wide-ish toebox which offers plenty of space, and my toes can play piano in them (just, well, I haven’t found a small enough piano yet). </p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>Hard to say, though possibly the Tri-C - the three sticky rubber compounds in different hardness - count as an innovation.</p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>After only two weeks of trail use its hard to judge on quality, though so far the shoe has held up very well, apart from some parts of the tread already starting to rub off. But then I have been <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/09/run-or-die-nuuksio-classic-trail-marathon.html">trailrunning</a> and <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/09/urho-kekkonen-national-park.html">backpacking</a> on a lot of rocks with them, so that’s to be expected. Other than that the shoe has held up very well, with no failures.</p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>My pair in UK Size 8.5 is 494 gram, or 247 g per shoe. Not the lightest, but so light that I felt the difference after using slightly heavier shoes. </p>

<h2 id="sustainability--recyclability">Sustainability &amp; Recyclability</h2>

<p>Inov-8 still has a nice little story on their website entitled “<a href="http://www.inov-8.com/New/Global/Environment.html?L=26">Inov-8, the environment and climate change</a>”. Inov-8 has undergone an Environmental Footprint audit, and they tell us about their carbon footprint (Surprise: Shoes &amp; packaging account for only 17% of it - the biggest impact comes from staff travel). I still am not aware if Inov-8 offers a take-back of their shoes for recycling (via retailers, for example).</p>

<p>Another aspect is the ethical question. The shoes are made in China, though that happily nowadays is more positive than in the past. Inov-8 also tell us about their <a href="http://www.inov-8.com/New/Global/Manufacturing-Ethics.html?L=26">Manufacturing Ethics</a>, in which they highlight that there’s no child labour involved in the making of their products, and that employees are paid above average salaries. </p>

<p>All in all I applaud that Inov-8 are transparent in their communications about these matters, though I’d welcome to see a Name &amp; Email there for interested people to contact them, as well as an independent source of the provided information for even more transparency.</p>

<p>Recyclability is also still a hard question, though as these hopefully will be in use for another few hundreds of trail kilometres it isn’t yet a pressing question. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9522122121/" title="New shoes: Inov-8 TrailRoc 235 by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5506/9522122121_cd3204a299_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="New shoes: Inov-8 TrailRoc 235" /></a></p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p>As said above, I used the TrailRoc 235 exclusively for backpacking and trailrunning, and for that I loved them right away. Their first outing they had on a Ultralight Backpacking Basics course, out of the box, fresh and never used before. It’s also where I managed to get them their nice muddy look as we navigated through a swamp. They were dry again an hour later, which I liked a lot. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9643589034/" title="There were roots. by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5461/9643589034_54a12afb22_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="There were roots." /></a></p>

<p>They also dry quickly after wading though a cool river - maybe an hour or two walking in warm temps and the shoes were dry again. Their mesh uppers don’t absorb a lot of water, and the shoe is quite airy - excellent for warm weather, for certain. It’s also stretchy, so if I find that little toe piano, I can insert it and still play it, because the mesh gives way a bit.</p>

<p>The protection against rocks &amp; roots is good, there’s a toe bumper, a thin plastic coating, which keeps your toes sane when you bump them against rocks and roots. It also helps to prevent getting stuff in, though if sand wants to get in, it will just try its luck via the mesh or that big hole where your foot goes in. The grip on rocks, mud and roots is very good in my opinion, I had no problems fording through rivers/ jumping from wet stone to wet stone. Even slippery and wet roots on forest trails didn’t make me slip, and not even the most slippery thing we have in Finland could stop me: Moist duckboards.</p>

<p>The Laces are much better than previous laces on inov-8s I had before, these tended to disintegrated at the top quickly, though these look like new still. They also don’t slip and once put closed (with a double knot) they stay closed. </p>

<h2 id="competing-products">Competing Products</h2>

<p>Well, there’s the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2012/07/inov-8-x-talon-190.html">X-Talon 190</a> and the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/04/salomon-speedcross-3.html">Salomon Speedcross 3</a>, but the latter have more cushioning than the TrailRoc here. The <a href="http://bit.ly/17nJZLe">TrailRoc 150</a> and the <a href="http://www.inov-8.com/New/Global/Product-View-BareGrip-200.html?L=26&amp;A=Off%20Trail&amp;G=Male">Bare-Grip 200</a> are Zero Drop shoes from inov-8, the <a href="http://bit.ly/17nJl0o">New Balance Minimus</a> shoes and the <a href="http://bit.ly/1eZBS72">Salomon S-Lab shoes</a>. Oh, and <a href="https://www.lunasandals.com/">Luna Sandals</a> with the Oso also should be considered a competitor. Amongst other, I’m certain!</p>

<h2 id="what-others-say">What Others Say</h2>

<p>Damien compares his <a href="http://www.toesalad.com/reviews/trail-shoe-showdown-the-vivobarefoot-breatho-trail-vs-the-inov-8-trailroc-235/">Inov-8 TrailRoc 235 with the VIVOBAREFOOT Breatho Trail</a>, Peter <a href="http://www.runblogger.com/2013/01/inov-8-trailroc-235-trail-running-shoe.html">rates them very high</a> and Ryan finds it’s a <a href="http://www.borntorun.com/blogs/barefoot-bulletin/7422436-inov-8-trailroc-235-review">superb trail runner</a>.</p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>Hiking and running in the TrailRoc 235s has been a pleasure. Great grip, lightweight, nice colours, quick-drying - I couldn’t ask for more. They have carried me safely up the highest mountain in Eastern Finland across extensiv boulder fields, helped me finish my first trailrunning marathon, and I’m looking forward to wear them soon again for late autumn backpacking!</p>
