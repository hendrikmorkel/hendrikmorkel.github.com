<p>Getting outside often involves numerous steps: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Get off from work</li>
  <li>Ask for permission from family members if it’s alright if you go for a run/ climb/ cycle/ swim</li>
  <li>Then you need to <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/02/layering-guide-how-to-dress-for-winter.html">dress up correctly</a></li>
  <li>You’ll need to bring the rubbish out on the way, too</li>
  <li>And on the way home, please bring milk and bananas, thank you</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, you’re able to enjoy the fresh smell of the forest, taste the salt in the air while you swim in the Baltic Sea, get sweaty palms four meters up on a Highball and look forward to the downhill run. This week is different, however. </p>

<p>This week is part of the European Commission’s #BeActive week which gives you basically <strong>a free pass to be active outdoors and do fun stuff</strong> in nature. The week is for everyone, regardless of age, background or fitness level - yes, also you sitting in front of that screen. Just grab your shoes and go for a stroll in the park, take your swim suit and take a dip in a lake, swing your leg over the bike and cycle to the top of the next hill, climb a rock or maybe even go camping! </p>

<p><em>The #BeActive, #ItsGreatOutThere and #MyWeek Campaigns are part of the annual <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/sport/week/index_en.htm">European Week of Sport</a> which is this year from the 7th to 13th of September and aims at getting people being more active. The reason is simple: Participation in sports &amp; physical activity is stagnating, and in some EU Member States, even declining. As being outdoors means being active taking part in these campaigns, and maintaining the habit of doing sports, helps you to lead a healthier, less stressful life.</em></p>
