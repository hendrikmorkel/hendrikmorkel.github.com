<p>The new issue has a very lengthy special on Via Ferratas by me, as well as hiking in dangerous terrain. The latter gives tips on what to do when there’s no blue bird weather but you’re confronted by hail, snow and strong winds, how to cross rivers and what to consoder when you’re in the mountains and on glaciers. In my gear column I talk about approach shoes and review five pairs of approach shoes from <a href="http://bit.ly/1zDfoq6">adidas</a>, <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/05/arcteryx-acrux2-fl-gtx.html">Arc’teryx</a>, <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/lowa-laurin-gtx-lo-approachschuhe/">Lowa</a>, <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/five-ten-guide-tennie-schuhe-ca-sun-ca-sun-uk4/">Five Ten</a> and <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/salomon-x-alp-gtx-approachschuhe/">Salomon</a>. There’s also great tips on outdoor photography and plenty of great trip reports in Germany, Austria, Italy and Romania.</p>

<p>I had a lot of fun writing for the second trekking Magazin issue of 2015. It included getting a lot of outdoor garments dirty and then learning about how to make them clean and functional again with the help of a bunch of outdoor detergents. Then I had fun taking photos for my hoody round-up and reviewing six hoodies, which should allow anyone who doesn’t have a hoody yet to find one for his needs! And finally I penned a story about my <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/tatra-mountains/">Polish Tatra</a> trip which you already could read about on these digital pages in the past. As usually that’s not all: My colleagues went out sleeping in <em>Biwakschachteln</em> (bivouac booths) in the Alps, while others went went exploring the Swiss Engadin and hike to an volcano that was erupting. A lot of really inspiring trip reports which certainly will get out in the mood for spring hikes!</p>

<p>My <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2010/10/from-russia-with-love.html">From Russia With Love</a> trip report is still super popular and in the first trekking Magazin issue of 2015 I wrote a trip report auf Deutsch. It’s a great looking article and gives tips to plan your own hike in Karelia, so well worth to pick it up just for that. In my gear column I talk about down jackets and review the <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/hagloefs-essens-ii-down-weste-noble-blue-s/?pid=81">Häglöfs Essens II Down Vest</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/14pEniz">Arc’teryx Cerium SL Jacket</a>, <a href="http://www.phdesigns.co.uk/yukon-down-jacket">PHD Yukon Down Jacket</a> and the <a href="http://bit.ly/1hh35k8">Mountain Equipment Vega Jacket</a>. </p>

<p>In the last issue of 2014 you will find in my Gear column a discussion of Hardshell Jackets for hiking. After discussing what a hardshell is made of and what it should have I review five different jackets which I have used this year. Elsewhere there is a company interview with ORTOVOX, tips on buying snowshoes and a visit to the island Elba in Tuscany.</p>

<p>In this issue I write about the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/07/arcteryx-alpine-academy-2014.html">Arc’teryx Alpine Academy</a> which I visited in June and give a lot of details about planning your own stay in Chamonix. In my columne I write about five great hiking pants from Houdini to Klättermusen, and then there’s a very long trip report in it about my hike on the Escapardenne Eisleck Trail in Luxembourg which I thru-hiked in May of this year. It’s a beautiful trail with lots to offer and is well suited for those that look for culture, nature and a well-marked trail.</p>
