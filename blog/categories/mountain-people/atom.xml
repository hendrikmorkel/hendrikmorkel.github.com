    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Running is a wonderful activity to enjoy the outdoors, push yourself and stay fit. Joe Grant is an Ultrarunner who has run in the Copper Canyon, on the Annapurna trail and around Mont Blanc. Why he loves to run, especially in the mountains and on long Ultras races, you read in this <em>Mountain People interview</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Hi Joe, thanks for taking the time to answer my questions =) Could you please briefly introduce yourself and tell us what you do?</strong></p>

<p>I have a pretty eclectic background having studied international management with a focus on nonprofit work. I worked in nonprofits for several years after college, but started my own business <a href="http://alpine-works.com">Alpine Works</a> about 4 years ago which encompasses my work as a mountain runner, coach, writer and photographer. I’ve been running consistently for about 10 years and started racing Ultras 7 years ago. </p>

<p><strong>You have been changing location often, living a semi-nomadic life. Do you foresee that you’ll continue to be a nomad, living where you like it, or that you settle down once you maybe have found a place you want to call home?</strong></p>

<p>I travel a lot, mainly for races, but own a home in Gold Hill, Colorado just outside of Boulder. I was born in the UK, grew up in France and have been living in the US on and off for the past 10 years. Most of my travel is related to work and I call Colorado home.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16459281759" title="Joe Grant, Alpine Works by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8576/16459281759_2ca7c495f5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Joe Grant, Alpine Works" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Well, lets move away from standing still and take a run. You’ve run across the globe - is there a trail that really stands out for you?</strong></p>

<p>I’m partial to the San Juan mountains in Southern Colorado, but it’s hard to really pin point one particular trail that really stands out. Any trail in a unique, wild environment is appealing to me. </p>

<p><strong>And is there a trail that you still want to run?</strong></p>

<p>I’d like to spend more time in Alaska and the Himalayas. The grandeur of both places is very inspiring to  me. </p>

<p><strong>Tell us please how you plan for a race like the one you ran in Costa Rica - how does it start, what all needs to be done before you leave home?</strong></p>

<p>Well, <a href="http://alpine-works.com/2015/02/the-coastal-challenge/">The Coastal Challenge</a> is a tough race to prepare in Colorado in the winter.  I did my best to get into reasonable shape mainly skiing and biking and some running to get the legs moving a bit. My specific preparation was far from ideal. Since the race transports all of your gear from camp to camp, I did pack judiciously to have enough food, clean clothes and books to really recover well between stages. Recovery during the event is a key piece to stage racing.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16619534966" title="Joe Grant, Alpine Works by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8622/16619534966_a3e484fe4c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Joe Grant, Alpine Works" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Do you have a FKT Attempt planned this year?</strong></p>

<p>I have a quite a few FKTs I want to attempt such as Nolan’s 14 or The Bob Graham Round to name a few, but the race calendar this year is pretty full for me to fit any of these into the season. After The Coastal Challenge, I’ll be racing TransGrancanaria, Ultra Fiord 100 in Patagonia, Western States 100 and UTMB.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16644042711" title="Joe Grant, Alpine Works by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8620/16644042711_bec1f586b9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Joe Grant, Alpine Works" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Besides running you also like ski-mountaineering, fastpacking and riding a Fatbike as I saw on your <a href="https://instagram.com/alpineworks/">Instagram</a> stream. Are these 100% pleasure or also part of your training?</strong></p>

<p>Both. I enjoy doing self-propelled activities in the mountains and in the winter for example skiing is most of the time a much more suited activity to where I live than running. All these activities do help my running though whether for strength, endurance or just taking a break from the pounding. Fastpacking is a great way to really immerse myself in nature for more extended periods of time. </p>

<p><strong>Any other past-times in the outdoors that you enjoy?</strong></p>

<p>I like climbing and scrambling a lot, often as an extension of running in the mountains.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16644452922" title="Joe Grant, Alpine Works by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8614/16644452922_83e6dd8995_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Joe Grant, Alpine Works" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Trailrunning is a trend sport across the globe right now and though the majority of trailrunners enjoy it because they can be running outside in the forests &amp; mountains only a small percentage also participates in races. Do you think taking part in a race should be on every trailrunners list? If so, what’s a good start?</strong></p>

<p>I think runners should do whatever motivates and inspires them. Most races have a great community aspect and provide a relatively safe environment to push oneself. Races can be limiting too because of permitting and other restriction so it’s sometimes better to just create your own adventure. I’d suggest choosing a race that inspires you, but that you can also adequately prepare for so I can enjoy your time.  </p>

<p><strong>As a coach you help runners to train for a race or event. If a complete novice runner would ask you for (free) advice on training, nutrition and gear, which three tips would you give him?</strong></p>

<p>Be consistent, eat real food and keep it simple.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16619535406" title="Joe Grant, Alpine Works by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8600/16619535406_3e0351394f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Joe Grant, Alpine Works" /></a></p>

<p><strong>What does your own training at home look like?</strong></p>

<p>During the running season, I run an average of 2-3 hours a day in the mountains with longer runs once of twice a week that are more specific to the race I’m preparing. In the winter I don’t run as much, but stay in shape skiing, biking and climbing.  </p>

<p><strong>Do you pursue a special diet?</strong></p>

<p>I don’t. I try to eat mainly whole, organic foods. My wife and I cook most of our meals. We also like eating out and don’t worry about occasional indulgences. </p>

<p><strong>Joe, thank you so much for taking the time to answer my questions. Any parting words?</strong></p>

<p>Thank you very much for featuring me on your site.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Travelling, climbing, family and training - how do you fit that all into a year well spent without going to a nine-to-five job? If you’re Said Belhaj, a professional climber from Sweden, it’s easy. You train three months at home and then travel the world and climb each day! <em>A <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/mountain-people/">Mountain People Interview</a>.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16504232795" title="Said Belhaj by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7299/16504232795_1aab6675e9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="682" alt="Said Belhaj" /></a></p>

<!-- more -->

<p><strong>Hi Said, I know you a bit - but my reader’s don’t. Could you please briefly introduce yourself and tell us what you do?</strong></p>

<p>I was born and raised in Göteborg, Sweden to a father from Morocco and mother from Finland. I have 2 brothers and I live with my girlfriend. I’m 33 years old and have been climbing for over 20 years, 14 years as pro. We have an appartment in Stockholm with my girlfriend but are renting it out as we are travelling so much for the moment. Right now I’m staying in Santiago, Chile. Tomorrow - who knows?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15881673364" title="Said Belhaj by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7396/15881673364_1af82e9851_b.jpg" width="1024" height="658" alt="Said Belhaj" /></a></p>

<p><strong>We met at the Abisko Ice Climbing Festival in Sweden in February 2014 - was that the first time for you to climb ice, or have you been secretly planning your alpine climbing career and soon will stand on an 8.000 m peak in the Himalayas?</strong></p>

<p>I’ve ice climbed a little bit in my life, when I’ve gotten the chance. I like to try a bit of everything but unfortunately there is not always time. I don’t see myself on top of a 8000 meter peaks in the near future but at the same time who knows? I started climbing because I was seeking the adventure and the unknown, a 8000 meter climb would probably be both!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16316772330" title="Said Belhaj by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7375/16316772330_bac20af718_b.jpg" width="1024" height="698" alt="Said Belhaj" /></a></p>

<p><strong>In your “20 years as a climber” presentation you highlighted how you started climbing - from “free-soloing” as a kid to trad climbing to sports climbing - all outdoors. Nowadays most people start climbing indoors at gyms, and just a small percentage of them head outside to climb on rock. How do you feel about that?</strong></p>

<p>For me it’s strange to do an outdoor activity indoors - it’s impossible. My life and climbing has always been about beeing outdoors. Indoor climbing is good for training, comps and meeting people sometimes. I can totally see why people who start indoors stay indoors and it’s the easy access to indoor walls that have made climbing grow. At the same time it’s starnge to be out climbing in areas that used to be packed with people 20 years ago and find them almost empy now. But I wonder what would happen if all those indoor climbers went out on real rock?!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16318319937" title="Said Belhaj by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7320/16318319937_067a5137ba_b.jpg" width="1024" height="752" alt="Said Belhaj" /></a></p>

<p><strong>You are nowadays - thanks to the great <a href="http://www.rockandice.com/lates-news/the-seeker-said-belhaj">Rock &amp; Ice portrait</a> - probably best known for hard sport climbing, but you also do some bouldering. Is bouldering for you something to keep fit for rock climbing, or do you see bouldering as an art of climbing in itself that you enjoy?</strong></p>

<p>I don’t categorize myself as a certain type of climber; all my climbing life I’ve been doing trad, sport, boulder, big-wall, comps and even some ice. I just love to climb and like all types. I think this is what makes climbing so unique: all types, their all fun, I never get bored, always something new to learn and discover. I do more of some dicipline during certain periods of the year but would never say no to any of them - they are all climbing and thats what we do every day.</p>

<p><strong>You’ve climbed across the globe - is there a route or crag that you did that really stands out for you, and that you would recommend to any climber to visit?</strong></p>

<p>It’s almost an impossible question as I’ve climbed in hundreds of different places in about 40 countries. I think you can’t compare them, they are just different. I’ve had amazing experiences in one way or another in all of them exept some boring days of training in the gym maybe.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16478236376" title="Said Belhaj by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7457/16478236376_a8611e0c60_b.jpg" width="685" height="1024" alt="Said Belhaj" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Is there a rock climbing route somewhere that you look forward to on leaving behind for others to enjoy?</strong></p>

<p>Well, I’ve put up quite a few routes on the Swedish Westcoast that people are climbing, some of them yet looking for a 2nd ascent. But because of the stupid political bolting situation in the area I’ve stopped for the moment. I’ve also put up trad routes and boulders but they never get mentioned. Anyway, I thinks it always destroys creativity when there are people who only criticize when we are trying to do something for everybody. We still have many things to learn as  humans and this can especially be said about climbers!</p>

<p><strong>How do you go about planning a climbing trip, how much time does it take to plan nine months of travelling and climbing?</strong></p>

<p>I don’t need so much time to plan these days. Usually I have some fixed plans for the year and leave some parts open. I usually do trips between 2 weeks - 3 months.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16503220012" title="Said Belhaj by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7302/16503220012_b10df947ac_b.jpg" width="1024" height="682" alt="Said Belhaj" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Who are your sponsors and how do they support you?</strong></p>

<p>My main partners are <a href="http://www.haglofs.com/">Haglöfs</a>, <a href="http://www.petzl.com/">Petzl</a>, <a href="http://www.sportiva.com">La Sportiva</a> and <a href="http://www.c2safety.com">C2</a> who support me with gear and money. Then I also have some other brands that support me with gear and food such as Clif Bar, <a href="http://hilleberg.se">Hilleberg</a>, <a href="http://www.primus.eu">Primus</a> and Nokia. With these partners I can do that I want and I have never really had a “normal” job in my life. I will never get really rich but I’ve always done what I wanted in life - the biggest wealth if you ask me.</p>

<p><strong>Where does your next trip take you?</strong></p>

<p>For the moment I’m climbing in Perú, Bolivia and Chile in South America. In the spring I’m planning to go back to Spain &amp; France which I do every year. I also have plans for next summer and autumn but let’s first see what happens in the near future.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16502501731" title="Said Belhaj by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8561/16502501731_ddcbbf1351_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Said Belhaj" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Your family is living across the globe - your father is from Morocco, your mother from Finland and you grew up in Sweden. You travel a lot and speak six languages fluently. How do they see your career, and is it hard to see them not that often?</strong></p>

<p>I think my family didn’t like my choise in life at first, mainly because they were afraid. But they have accepted and realized I’m taking care of myself. Not seeing my family &amp; friends as often as I’d like it’s the prize I’ve had to pay to do what I do. All great things in life come to a high prize.</p>

<p><strong>You wrote on your blog that your usual yearly schedule is to train January to March at home and then travel the rest of the year. What does your training at home look like?</strong></p>

<p>I follow a 12 week training program that we’ve put together with Carlos Cabrera. I do about 10 sessions per week indoor and if possible I try to get outside on rock once a week -to stay sane. This might sound crazy but it’s totally worth it, then I can climb on rock for the rest of the year. Also, it gives me time to be in Sweden and see my family and friends. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15881673704" title="Said Belhaj by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8577/15881673704_cd8efa54fd_b.jpg" width="1024" height="734" alt="Said Belhaj" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Andy Kirkpatrick, a mountaineer from the UK, made in his essay “How To Hone Your Alpine Psyche” his first point to not have kids. You’re not yet a father, which makes climbing hard and travelling a lot easier. But do you think that at some point in time you will settle down and start a family?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, of course I’d love to have a family and get married soon. I don’t want to end up being this dirtbag dude who lives out of his van alone when I’m 50! But this doens’t mean I will stop climbing, climbing is for life.</p>

<p><strong>Said, gracias for taking the time to answer my questions.</strong></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Where would you want to work if you love the outdoors and have studied design? If you live in Sweden and also like shelters then <a href="http://hilleberg.se">Hilleberg the Tentmaker</a> would be a good call. That’s also what Ulrika Rogeman thought - and now works as a Product Designer at Hilleberg. She is also the designer of the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/07/outdoor-news-2014-day-2.html">Hilleberg Enan</a>, the lightest Hilleberg tent yet! <em>Read this <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/mountain-people/">Mountain People Interview</a> to find out about what goes into designing an ultralight tent that can carries the Hilleberg name!</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16323243841" title="Hilleberg Enan Magnus Brogren Jämtland by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7506/16323243841_0e412a686a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Hilleberg Enan Magnus Brogren Jämtland" /></a></p>

<!-- more -->

<p><strong>Hej Ulrika, thanks for taking the time to answer my questions. Could you please introduce yourself briefly, so we have an idea what’s your 
background?</strong></p>

<p>My name is Ulrika Rogeman and I am 30 years old. I have been working at Hilleberg with Product Design for three years. Since September my responsibilities has extended to include Material Development as well. I came straight from University when I started at Hilleberg. I have a degree in Mechanical Engineering, but my education did focus on product development as well - and especially development of outdoor products. So the job at Hilleberg is exactly what I studied to work with! </p>

<p>I have always been an outdoor person and I enjoy any activity that takes me to the mountains. The last years there has been a lot of trailrunning, biking and ski mountaineering in my life. It is extra fun to develop a lightweight tent like Enan when I really can see myself use it when for example I go running in the mountains. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16332748675" title="Ulrika Rogeman by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8587/16332748675_acce85f67d_o.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Ulrika Rogeman" /></a></p>

<p><strong>We met at the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/outdoor-fair-2014/">OutDoor</a> and you showed me the new <a href="http://hilleberg.se/news/enan-new-2015">Hilleberg Enan</a> - your design! How was the idea born to create the Enan, as Hilleberg has two tents - the Anjan and Akto - which potentially could suit the space the Enan now takes?</strong></p>

<p>The plan to make a one person 3-season tent (at Hilleberg we call the 3-season tents <em>Yellow Label</em>) started when we made Anjan and Rogen, the other Hilleberg Yellow Label models. We definitely believe that there is room for a 1,1 kg Hilleberg tent between Anjan and Akto, for those who really need to prioritize weight but still want the security and quality that a Hilleberg tent offers. </p>

<p><strong>You told me the Enan is based on the footprint of the Akto and also uses some design features of this tent. Would it be correct to think that the Enan has been designed for Akto enthusiasts which want a 3-Season tent?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, definitely! Although Enan is not just an Akto with lighter materials. Once you start to use Enan you will see that there are several design details that are different in order to make the tent lighter. All these details have been thought through carefully so that we have a light tent but still a tent that is true to the other Hilleberg principles: Reliability, Adaptability, Ease of Use, Durability and Comfort.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16137655470" title="Hilleberg Enan by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7548/16137655470_69b8386b54_b.jpg" width="1024" height="592" alt="Hilleberg Enan" /></a></p>

<p><strong>How long have you been working on the Enan - from the idea was born till the final production model?</strong></p>

<p>About two years. First I made initial sketches of interesting designs, then sketches were transformed into 1-to-1 scale cord-skeletons just to get a feeling of the design and its behaviour. Then I made patterns and sew prototypes for the most interesting designs. These were tested out in the nature, but I also tested them in our wind machine, which actually is a snow cannon. At the same time as I was testing the design there were several different materials tested in the tent in order to find the best combination between low weight and strength. For example we tested using poles with a smaller diameter, but realized that in strong wind these poles did not have the strength that we looked for so instead we use the same strong 9 mm pole that we have in Akto. </p>

<p>When I finally found a design that matched both low weight and strength it was time to work with the details. One example is that I have tried to use the tent in rainstorm by adding water to the wind machine. It is the result of that test that the shutters that can cover the short ends were developed. In most weather they are absolutely unnecessary and it is much better to go with full ventilation. But when the rain is close to horizontal they will give you the extra security to prevent your outdoor adventure from turning into a nasty, unsafe experience. </p>

<p>When the tent was almost as perfect as we want it to be, it was time to send it out with people that are not working at Hilleberg to get their opinion of the tent. In total Enan has been outdoors more than 140 nights before we introduced the tent.</p>

<p><strong>Have you looked at other tent designs while designing the Enan? As it has some similarities with the <a href="http://www.tarptent.com/moment.html">Tarptent Moment</a> - would you say that’s coincidence and just shows that a good design can be conceived on opposite places of the world (like the Pyramids, which have been built by the Mayans and Egyptians)?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, I have looked at other tents, as a product developer you have to be aware of other products, maybe not because of the design, more in order to know the weight and price of the products that are in the same product range. But honestly, there are quite a few lightweight tents that resemble each other. I believe that Enan has more in common with Hilleberg’s own Akto rather than any model from another brand. </p>

<p><strong>Hilleberg also has for the first time created a tent that’s very close to the 1 kg packed weight limit, while keeping the Hilleberg principles of strength and durability. You’re using the new Kerlon 600 fabric as a shell for this tent, how did you set the specifics for this material?</strong></p>

<p>Ones again we have to go back to the Hilleberg principles. A low weight will always mean that we have to compromise with the other principles, but we are only willing to take the compromise to a certain limit. The initial specifications were set from the long experience of tent making that we have at Hilleberg. From these initial specifications different material designs were tested at the Mid Sweden University Textile Laboratory that we have access to. As I mentioned before, different fabrics were also tested in the different tent designs. Eventually we felt that Kerlon 600 was the fabric that matched our demands the best. It is also Kerlon 600 that has been used during the more than 140 nights that Enan has been out. Throughout all these tests we have been able to verify that the initial specification match what we need the fabric to perform.  </p>

<p><strong>What are other design details of the Enan you are really proud of?</strong></p>

<p>I am mostly proud of how simple the tent is, the tent design talks for itself and you do not have to be an engineer to use it correctly. Simplicity in combination with high quality gives a thought through product. It takes a lot of work and thinking to find out how a product can be simplified but still be a high quality product. It is the things that are removed that I am most proud of. </p>

<p><strong>You said the Enan fits two persons in a pinch - you have used it with your partner in Lapland, if I recall correctly - so do you think we’ll  see Adventure Racers use your tents in the future, or is Hilleberg maybe even sponsoring some Adventure Racing teams with the Enan?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, or well I have used it when me and my partner have been out running in the mountains of Jämtland, the region where the Hilleberg office is located. One time when we were out the weather was really bad and we were soaking wet when we stopped running and pitched the tent. But to hang out, two persons, in the tent the rest of the evening was really not a problem. Although I suggest that you know each other quite well! </p>

<p>I absolutely believe that Enan will be used in adventure races. Actually we have already lent out the tent during some competitions. For example our Hilleberg friend <a href="http://hilleberg.se/christine-hägglund">Christine Hägglund</a> used it with her teammate during the mountain orienteering race <a href="http://www.bamm.nu">BAMM</a> that takes place in the far north of Sweden. </p>

<p><strong>The Enan will be available in 2015 to consumers - do you think it will be popular?</strong></p>

<p>I hope so! Or to be more specific, I hope that people that really need a low weight tent likes Enan. I think that if you want comfort and a long lasting tent you should look for one of our <a href="http://hilleberg.se/product/saivo">Black Label</a> models.  </p>

<p><strong>Ulrika, I thank you for taking the time for answering my questions! Any closing words?</strong></p>

<p>Go out and enjoy the mountains, fjells and wilderness!</p>

<p>The idea for the <em>Mountain People Interviews</em> Series has been ripening in my head since spring 2014 and a lot of preperation and work has gone into it since, lining up the interview partners, coming up with the questions and editing the interviews. However, visiting the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/07/arcteryx-alpine-academy-2014.html">Arc’teryx Alpine Academy</a>, the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/outdoor-fair-2014/">OutDoor Fair</a> and the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2015/01/petzl-roctrip-2014-turkey.html">Petzl RocTrip</a> really has allowed me to meet the interesting people I wanted to ask more questions.</p>

<p>I have a dozen interviews in the pipeline with designers, alpinists, photographers and climbers which should make for an interesting series with different views and perspectives on why people love the mountains. I’m really excited about this series as it allowed me to ask the people who design the gear we use, photograph the athletes we admire, and those that are <em>Living the Dream</em> to ask them about their passion for the fjells, hills and mountains of this world. Stay tuned for the first interview later this week!</p>
