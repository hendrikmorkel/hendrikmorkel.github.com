    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m just back from my first ISPO, but first it’s time to look again at what our favourite ultralight gear cottages have in store for us in 2014. Like in <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/02/new-gear-from-the-cottages-2013.html">2013</a>, <a href="http://hrxxlight.com/">Benjamin</a> and me teamed up to present you the latest and greatest New Gear from the Cottages for 2014!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/12318735523/" title="New Gear from the Cottages 2014"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3687/12318735523_a808768d20_b.jpg" width="1024" height="479" alt="New Gear from the Cottages 2014" /></a></p>

<h2 id="as-tucas">As Tucas</h2>

<p>The new kid on the block is already making quiet a name for itself. <a href="http://astucas.com/">As Tucas</a> hails from Spain and makes garments and gear, as well as custom works. Their Sestrals collection of insulated garments and gear will be expanded with new and cozy members: An insulated hoody top (in both jacket and pullover versions), a flat quilt and a wearable quilt for those who love true multi-use tools.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/12321392944/" title="Sestrals Flat Quilt"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2854/12321392944_88e2b53444_b.jpg" width="960" height="640" alt="Sestrals Flat Quilt" /></a></p>

<p>Before the snow (which snow?) transforms into rain, As Tucas will offer a whole new line of rainwear. Ultralight yet functional jackets and pants made with 2,5 layer fabric and WPB Event - Cuben fiber. </p>

<p>Also their silnylon flat tarp is almost ready, and will be a more affordable version of their Arazas cuben tarp - made with same care to detail, coming seam sealed to you. If you like to ride your bike, you will soon be able to keep your hands warm and happy with their new pogies.</p>

<p>In the back-end, the As Tucas workshop has been equipped with new machines, including a flat lock and an embroidery machine. New fabrics are on their way to the workshop, and many others are being tested. New colours of their flagship shell fabric (Momentum 50) will be available in March. Also their already great website will be further improved, so keep an eye out on that.</p>

<h2 id="packrafting-store">Packrafting Store</h2>

<p>Lets wander a bit north and hear what the <a href="http://packrafting-store.de/">Packrafting Store</a> has for news. Well, they will celebrate their second anniversary on February 15th this year, and you might want to subscribe to their <a href="http://www.packrafting-store.de/newsletter.php?language=en">newsletter</a> for that occasion.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/12318667885/" title="Anfibio Buoy Boy by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7310/12318667885_370cd4ed90_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Anfibio Buoy Boy" /></a></p>

<p>The long awaited Packafting vest, the Anfibio Buoy Boy, is an inflatable jacket serving much like a PFD, yet it can’t be claimed that way, since you need (<em>and could forget</em>) to blow it up! That is the official rules. No regular life jacket (ISO Norm), only standard CE for quality production. Nevertheless, it features two independent chambers at combined 80 N buoyancy. The all mesh back does not interfere with your packrafts back rest, and is made from sturdy 210den TPU laminated nylon and a chunky front zipper provides some back up. Weight is 310g (medium), the extra crotch strap 30g. Packing size is second to none. It will sell for 79€ within the European Union only. Comes in blue (medium) and light red (large). </p>

<p>And in case you’re wondering, Anfibio is the gear brand of the Packrafting Store, specialising in packrafting accessories. It is a design and development label based on user experiences. Sourcing up partners with manufacturing expertise allows them to create a range of products directly suited to packrafting’s unique requirements.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/12318818153/" title="Cargo Fly by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3792/12318818153_3e1b807d9f_b.jpg" width="900" height="600" alt="Cargo Fly" /></a></p>

<p>Secondly, the workshop at the Packrafting Store HQ can now provide Cargo Fly retrofits within the European Union. Any used Alpacka Raft can get upgraded with this unique feature - probably the best thing you can add to your boat! Price including return shipping in the EU will most likely be 299€.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/12318666075/" title="Shearwater webbed paddle by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7313/12318666075_21d8b86c2d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Shearwater webbed paddle" /></a>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/12318666605/" title="Shearwater webbed paddle by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3784/12318666605_5987acf8c0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Shearwater webbed paddle" /></a></p>

<p>Bike rafters will like the Shearwater webbed paddle, a collapsible paddle that packs down really small. There is real science behind it (bionics) providing economic propulsion and ergonomic handling, despite the looks (duck feet, anyone?). And then there’s the Anfibio Multibag. A multifuntion dry-/compression-/water-/shower bag with real tight top closure. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/12319099774/" title="Anfibio Multibag by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7429/12319099774_582c01c312_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Anfibio Multibag" /></a></p>

<p>Furthermore: The Alpacka CuriYak will be available front them, for the competitive price of 680€. Likewise, Hyperlite Mountain Gear joins the Packrafting Store and offers you thus a one-stop shop for all your packrafting needs.</p>

<h2 id="laufbursche">LAUFBURSCHE</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.laufbursche-gear.de/">LAUFBURSCHE</a> has been very, very busy in the last months, and launches three new packs which surely will reign supreme in the UL market.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/12320452523/" title="PACKsack"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3753/12320452523_558bd4791f_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="PACKsack" /></a></p>

<p>Introducing: The LAUFBURSCHE PACKsack. A 24 l pack which will be available in weights of 130 g (70den Ripstop Nylon) and 165 g (210den DxG). It’s THE pack for SUL enthusiasts, as it has a comfort limit of 5 to 6 kg. The red YKK Aquaguard zipper keeps snow (which snow?) and rain out, and you can strap your poles, mat and rain jacket to the outside. Clean lines, small size, gorgeous, and in 2014 also as a very special HiF Edition available. Yeps, that’s right.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/12320291555/" title="PACKraum by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3812/12320291555_2d86fed2c4_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="PACKraum" /></a></p>

<p>Introducing: The LAUFBURSCHE PACKraum. A 38 l pack which weighs 320 g and has a comfort limit of 10 kg, this pack combines with your Klymit AirBeam frame. It’s One size fits all and has two large side pockets (2 l each), and carries as comfortable as you’re used to from LAUFBURSCHE - if not even more, as the re-designed shoulder straps are now 12 mm thick. An ideal pack for the Ultralight backpacker and those that need a backpack for their urban every-day adventures.</p>

<p>And then there’s still the huckePACK. But you’ll need to check Benjamin’s post for it =)</p>

<h2 id="katabatic-gear">Katabatic Gear</h2>

<p><a href="http://katabaticgear.com/">Katabatic Gear</a> is entering the backpack market with two backpack designs. Coming in spring 2014 there will be a lightweight climbing pack and an ultralight backpacking pack. The climbing packs will feature durable fabrics and construction and should be ideal for fast and light climbers. The streamlined design easily carries ice tools and crampons, with removable compression straps for larger items like skis. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/12318806013/" title="Katabatic Gear climbing pack by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7346/12318806013_db6c0e3330_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" alt="Katabatic Gear climbing pack" /></a></p>

<p>The ultralight backpacking pack will be made of the Cuben Fiber hybrid fabric, making it a lightweight option that doesn’t cut corners on features, durability, or design. Both of the packs will utilize their proprietary frame system, featuring a supportive, dual-density back panel and removable aluminium stay. The contoured frame design offers more support than traditional UL frame systems, while remaining extremely lightweight and comfortable.</p>

<p>Then there’s also a new quilt in the line up. The Grenadier 5°F has a Pertex Endurance shell and a generous loft, making it a versatile cold weather bag for the ultralight traveler. Available with the premium 900 fill-power down or 850 fill power water-resistant down, the <a href="http://katabaticgear.com/shop/grenadier-sleeping-bag/">Grenadier is available now</a>.</p>

<h2 id="flat-cat-gear">Flat Cat Gear</h2>

<p><a href="http://flatcatgear.com/">Flat Cat Gear</a> now has their Bobcat Jr. Cooking System available in titanium, while the Focus Fire 14 Titanium will be in BETA Testing soon. This stove was designed to maximise the efficiency of a single 14 gram Esbit solid fuel tablet. Jon can bring 4 cups of water up from 70 F to 200 F in bench top testing. The Focus Fire 14 Titanium UL 15 weighs 5 grams.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/12318817523/" title="Focus Fire 14 Titanium by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2818/12318817523_f6550dc190_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Focus Fire 14 Titanium" /></a></p>

<p>The Epicurean Titanium UL stove has been updated for better robustness. It is a solid fuel stove designed for dry baking and will burn a 14 gram Esbit tablet for 50 to 60 minutes. It weighs 7 g.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/12318665535/" title="Epicurean Titanium UL15 by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3770/12318665535_a806dc4fd8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Epicurean Titanium UL15" /></a></p>

<h2 id="locus-gear">Locus Gear</h2>

<p><a href="http://locusgear.com/">LOCUS GEAR</a> will launch their “Nyx”  synthetic quilt in March. Made from a Pertex Quantum GL shell and what has been know thus far as PrimaLoft ONE, and should weigh around 540 g including stuff sack.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/12318815173/" title="Nyx quilt"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3696/12318815173_8226c2c44f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="nyx (3)" /></a></p>

<p>The new color Silnylon colour for 2014 is called Bronze Mist and it is a yellowish light brown. All Sil shelters are already available in this new colour, which looks very pretty, if I may say so.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/12318657455/" title="Khafra Sil Bronze Mist with Aquaguard red zipper"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7443/12318657455_557bdfc891_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Khafra Sil Bronze Mist with Aquaguard red zipper" /></a></p>

<p>Locus Gear also started to offer various inner shelters for both the Khufu and the Khafra, which are also already available, while the Menkura shelter will be available soon.</p>

<h2 id="hariyama-productions">Hariyama Productions</h2>

<p><a href="http://hariyama.net/">Hariyama Productions</a> is a Japanese cottage that will launch in the near future. I have seen and used some of their products already, and am delighted. High quality craftsmanship, made in Japan. </p>

<p>Follow them on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Hariyama-Productions/183435505038499">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hariypro">Twitter</a>.</p>

<h2 id="ogawand">Ogawand</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.ogawand.com/home/OGAWAND_top.html">OGAWAND</a> is another Japanese cottage which makes some great looking and functional gear. Their <a href="http://www.ogawand.com/prpducts/OGAWAND_backpack_OWN.html">OWN</a> backpack is a pack which adapts in size to your needs, and can go from 25 to 50 l in no time. It even can carry your rope. I have seen this pack in use and it is beautifully made, and weighs in at 530 g - available now. New for 2014 will be the OWN-Light. It will have an updated pattern and uses the Dyneema 140 denier material, but will be about 100 g lighter. </p>

<h2 id="wanderlust-equipment">WANDERLUST EQUIPMENT</h2>

<p><a href="http://wanderlust-equipment.com/">WANDERLUST EQUIPMENT</a> is the final Japanese cottage in this article which designs and manufacturers really innovative gear. Their <a href="http://wanderlust-equipment.com/products/orbiter-pack/">Orbiter Pack</a> is a unique take on the burrito style of packing, as the pad is in this design the frame - and you pack your gear inside of it. It’s very much a slimmed down ULA EPIC, as this pack weighs just 330 g. I can see this working as a good trailrunning pack, too, so it’s really multi-use. Check them out, they have some sweet cooking gear, a UL pick cover for your ice axes and a UL Mesh peg case!</p>

<h2 id="bushbuddy">BushBuddy</h2>

<p><a href="http://bushbuddy.ca/">BushBuddy</a> is continuing to work on the the development and testing of the titanium stove. And it might be available, possibly maybe, towards the end of this year.</p>

<h2 id="six-moon-designs">Six Moon Designs</h2>

<p>In 2013 Brian Frankle joined <a href="http://www.sixmoondesigns.com/">Six Moon Designs</a>, and a year later we can see finally the fruits of this collaboration. There are four new packs split into two pack families, with a possible additional pack release later in the year. The first packs should be available by April this year, and the first infos on the <a href="http://www.sixmoondesigns.com/smdnews/152-flight-backpacks.html">Flight series</a> came out on Monday. The packs come with a Vest Harness and an optional hipbelt is available, while sizes will be 30 and 44 l, weighing 425 g and 879 g, respectively. </p>

<p>Furthermore, they are reworking their Cuben Fiber lineup of shelters and have just finished updating the Haven CF tarp, which will start production soon. It is stronger, easier to setup, more stable and incorporates the Hidden Seam Technology. Last year’s production run of Skyscape X’s had a second door, but the next production run will include some additional changes that will lighten the tent, simplify setup and make it easier to reconfigure. Also the Serenity NetTent has undergone a makeover, and the new version will support an 8” deep bathtub floor, and a taller canopy that is more centred over the sleeping area.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Cottage manufacturers make the Lightweight &amp; Ultralight gear we use and love. And while OR in the USA, and ISPO in Munich right now give us an overload of shiny, new and often not that lightweight gear, <a href="http://hrxxlight.com/">Benjamin</a> and me decided to get together and present you the latest and greatest New Gear from the Cottages for 2013!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8446343273/" title="New Gear from the Cottages! by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8364/8446343273_6d67eaaf24_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="New Gear from the Cottages!" /></a></p>

<h2 id="elemental-horizons">Elemental Horizons</h2>

<p>Matthew from Elemental Horizons launched the <a href="http://www.elementalhorizons.com/aduro-sl-pack.aspx">Aduro SL Pack</a> at the start of the year. A unique clam shell panel load design makes packing your pack &amp; organizing gear easy, and the Klymit Air Beam frame sheet helps to provide excellent support and comfort. This 42 l backpack - roomy enough to hold a weekend bear canister inside - comes in two torso lengths and weighs 663 g with a Frame Sheet, or 570 g without, and is made in the USA.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8446355199/" title="Aduro by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8352/8446355199_bc2584250f_b.jpg" width="800" height="800" alt="Aduro" /></a></p>

<h2 id="yama-mountain-gear">YAMA Mountain Gear</h2>

<p>YAMA Mountain Gear will soon release a single wall version of the <a href="http://yamamountaingear.com/gear-room/shaped-tarps/cirriform">Cuben Cirriform Tarp</a> and expand their DIY line to include a Cirriform Kit - great news for Cuben Lovers &amp; MYOGers alike. The Cuben Cirriform in the minimal configuration will weigh a scant 213 g; and the craftsmanship going into this shelter is going to make is (water-) bomb proof. </p>

<p>YAMA is also giving back to the community with their <a href="http://yamamountaingear.com/mYAMAdventure">mYAMAdventure</a> program. It will assist hikers with their first ‘big adventure’ while giving back to those maintaining and protecting the trail systems, and is a unique case of a cottage giving back to the community - Respect!</p>

<p><a href="http://yamamountaingear.com/gear-room/shaped-tarps/cirriform" title="Cuben Cirriform"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8092/8447430740_929ec610dd_b.jpg" width="800" height="539" alt="yama_cirriform-sw" /></a></p>

<h2 id="mountain-laurel-designs">Mountain Laurel Designs</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.mountainlaureldesigns.com/">Mountain Laurel Designs</a> has a lot of new gear coming this year, and does that while staying 100% in-house, craftsman-driven, and made in the USA! Those who order from MLD will also like to hear that the company expanded their production to allow for shorter wait times. </p>

<p>Ron has sourced a 10d 3XDWR fabric and ClimaShield Apex insulation which means there are going to be some new quilts coming this year. Their current quilt is well-liked, and this is surely going to be a hit with the synthetic quilt crowd.</p>

<p>SUL Fans are surely going to like the 99 g Cuben pack MLD is going to release this year. Design-wise it will be like the Newt with one rear pocket; so really something for SUL/ XUL backpackers who pack a minimal kit, or those who look for a very light daypack/ summit pack.</p>

<p>The Burn and Prophet packs will get an inflatable frame option plus load lifters, which means they get an internal frame pad sleeve that fits the current Klymit backpack frames, like the current Exodus FS minus the CF rod rigid frame. Made for those who need a bit more support and don’t like using the traditional virtual frame (Burrito-Style sleep pad inside the pack), this gives you more vertical support.</p>

<p>Oh, and women’s versions of all packs are due as well. That’s great news!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8447689596/" title="TrailStar Compact by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8055/8447689596_cf7e242655_b.jpg" width="720" height="182" alt="TrailStar Compact" /></a></p>

<p>The prototype TrailStar Compact (a better name is sought) is in the works, and should fit smaller people better. It’s lighter, too - about 71 grams. It will be about 15% smaller with a 6’ baseline at the edge vs the 7’ of the regular one. A date when it will be available has yet to appear.</p>

<h2 id="trail-designs">Trail Designs</h2>
<p>The guys at Trail Designs just released the <a href="http://www.traildesigns.com/stoves/fissure-ti-tri-system">Fissure</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.traildesigns.com/stoves/fusion-ti-tri">Fusion</a> split cone systems, which means there’s more protection for your stove and pot while still allowing you to pack the cone inside your pot. They’re also working on a little add-on which will come later this year, and should make cooking on your Trail Designs stoves a lot easier!</p>

<p><a href="http://litetrail.com/">Lite Trail</a> not only sells a wide variety of very useful UL accessories, they also have some very exciting new gear coming for us UL backpackers! The <a href="http://litetrail.com/shop/litetrail-hline-dyneema-hang-haul-cord">LiteTrail H-Line Hang and Haul Dyneema Cordage</a> is already available, which is a 2.5 mm diameter high quality Dyneema cordage. A slick nano coating and 580 kg breaking strength means you also can haul not so UL loads with it! </p>

<p>The lightest <a href="http://litetrail.com/shop/litetrail-titanium-solid-fuel-cook-system">Solid Fuel Cook System</a> on the market just got better! The pot gets handles with heat resistant rubberized covers (<em>the photo shows an early prototype</em>), and the windscreen is redesigned with spot welding so paper clips are no longer required (they’re easy to lose if you’re not careful). A narrower spaced hole pattern that goes 50% around the circumference and a nice contoured cutout for those new handles was also added. A 900 ml pot is also coming some time this year and all pots should be lighter than what’s currently available, so good reason to be excited!</p>

<p>Winter backpackers who need to melt snow will like the 1600 ml Titanium pot that LiteTrail is hoping to bring out soon, which would also make a great group pot for summer trips. A flat top lid, possibly a bail wire handle for hanging from a tripod over a wood fire (yay!) and again lighter than any other 1600 ml titanium pot on the market.</p>

<h2 id="zpacks">ZPacks</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.zpacks.com/">ZPacks</a>’ owners Joe and Sheryl Valesko are thru-hiking the Te Araroa Trail in New Zealand at the moment, and while Joe gets a lot of ideas while on the trail these will need to wait until April to be constructed! At ZPacks Matt Favero is managing the store and it is open, and all the gear is available as usual.</p>

<h2 id="ula-equipment">ULA Equipment</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=ml&amp;ti=45265&amp;pw=73183">ULA Equipment</a> has been going from strength to strength in 2012, and have made a lot of people very happy by releasing their backpacks in camo and purple besides the standard green. For 2013 ULA will offer any of their packs also in Cuben, which is very exciting for those who want to save even more weight!</p>

<p>The ULA packs are now made from the new ULA 210 Robic fabric, which is three times as hard to puncture than Dyneema. However, the packs remain the same weight, which means you are getting a lot more durability now.</p>

<p>I also asked Chris about how he feels that Brian Frankle (who is the Founder of ULA until he sold the company) joined Six Moon Designs. Chris was very positive about it and thinks that Brian will help SMD to improve on their current pack line, and he wishes them all the best with their cooperation.</p>

<h2 id="warbonnet">Warbonnet</h2>
<p><a href="http://warbonnetoutdoors.com/">Warbonnet Outdoors</a> is coming out with a new version of their popular <a href="http://warbonnetoutdoors.com/blackbirds.php">Blackbird</a> hammock, the Blackbird XLC. It is longer, and has a convertible top. Here is <a href="http://youtu.be/CRoO_hx33Cg">a video</a> where Brandon shows it off.</p>

<h2 id="jacks-r-better">Jacks ‘R’ Better</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.jacksrbetter.com/">Jacks ‘R’ Better</a> has a new website! But that’s not all that got re-designed: JRB top quilts now come with 14 baffle sections versus the older 10 baffle sections for better down stability. You’ll also like the price reductions across the board for quilts and hammocks - JRB quilts are now even better &amp; more affordable! The Jacks will also have a limited quantity run of a digital camo down quilt. If that’s something for you, subscribe to their Newsletter as these are bound to sell out quickly!</p>

<h2 id="lightheart-gear">LightHeart Gear</h2>
<p>Judy from <a href="http://lightheartgear.com/">LightHeart Gear</a> has a couple of great ideas, which she is Alpha testing on the trail at the moment and hence can’t tell us more. There’s also going to be a camouflage silnylon version of the great Solo Tent, and in case you didn’t know yet, yes, you can get a Solo now in Cuben!</p>

<h2 id="laufbursche">Laufbursche</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.laufbursche-gear.de/">LAUFBURSCHE</a> is coming out with an UL shoulder bag for those who want to carry a minimalistic bag when they head to a meeting or to the office. Impeccably made German quality, this is going to be the next ‘in’ item in the UL community, I reckon. </p>

<h2 id="gardner-outdoor-lightweight-designs">Gardner Outdoor Lightweight Designs</h2>
<p>Nothing new here besides the cottage itself! <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/GOLDGearLite">Gardner Outdoor Lightweight Designs</a> offers Polycryo tarps, trekking poles and a variety of stoves. Prices are reasonable, so give them a look.</p>

<h2 id="lawson-equipment">Lawson Equipment</h2>
<p><a href="http://lawsonequipment.com/">Mountainfitter</a>, also known as Lawson Equipment, sells a variety of UL accessories that you might need but are hard to find. While in the past they have offered Cuben shelters, these are at the moment not available. </p>

<h2 id="klymit">Klymit</h2>
<p>While <a href="http://klymit.com/">Klymit</a> is not really a cottage I’d say, those who like amphibian travel options (aka packrafting) will be delighted to hear that the company is planning to bring out <a href="http://gearjunkie.com/best-in-show-outdoor-retailer-winter-2013">a small packraft</a>. 907 grams light and it packs as small as a book. It looks like another company realizes that packrafting is a growing segment for outdoors people, and at $225 it is even cheaper than the FlytePacker!</p>

<h2 id="flyweight-designs">FlyWeight Designs</h2>
<p>Speaking of <a href="http://flyweightdesigns.com/">FlyWeight Designs</a>, besides the new website (well, it went life last year in spring =) there’s not much information coming from the company. They were working on a inflatable seat last year, as well as on a new sub-2 kg packraft, but otherwise there hasn’t been much news from them. <em>I heard back from Marc and they’re indeed still working on some prototypes, so keep you eyes on their site for news.</em></p>

<h2 id="hyperlite-mountain-gear">Hyperlite Mountain Gear</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.hyperlitemountaingear.com/">Hyperlite Mountain Gear</a> is set to enter the Pyramid Shelter segment this year, with one-person, two-person and four-person sizes. Yes, that’s right - and that’s all I’m able to tell you at the moment. Sorry! Keep your eyes on their website &amp; social media channels to get a glimpse of these shelters at some point!</p>

<p>In 2012 HMG released a couple of note-worthy UL items, like a 3400 cu in version of their ice climbing and winter mountaineering pack, the <a href="http://www.hyperlitemountaingear.com/packs/3400-ice-pack.html">Ice Pack</a>. I have the 2400 version and love it, so the extra space in this pack means you can go for a weekender to the mountains and carry it all in your pack. A removable, padded hip belt adds a bit more comfort and support, and the exterior patch for crampon and ice axe attachment makes sure nothing spiky can destroy your pack. Oh, and a 4400 cu in version of this pack, as well as the Windrider, are in the works, too. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.hyperlitemountaingear.com/packs/3400-ice-pack.html" title="3400 Ice Pack"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8224/8446343289_f740b6036b_b.jpg" width="681" height="1024" alt="3400-ice-front" /></a></p>

<p>Another pack I’ve been using for a long time now got a 2400 cu in version: The <a href="http://www.hyperlitemountaingear.com/packs/hmg-porter-pack-72.html">Porter Pack</a>. This smaller brother comes without a frame and weighs 737 gram, and now comes with the option to add two Spectra Hardline, zippered hip belt pockets, and of course has the simplicity of its big brothers.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hyperlitemountaingear.com/hiking-climbing-shelters/tarps/hmg-flat-tarps.html">Cuben fiber flat tarps</a> in three sizes came out in 2012 as well. A flat tarp is a great, versatile shelter and it’s good to see these kind of shelters being offered. </p>
