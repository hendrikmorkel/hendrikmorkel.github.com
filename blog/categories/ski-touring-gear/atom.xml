<p>Before my first ski-touring trip to Canada last year I was worried: How should I transport my skis, boots and everything else in a way that it arrives in one piece and that it is easy for me to carry? What do I all need to take? After much research, reading gear reviews, making my own experienced guesses and adapting my ultralight packing strategy for ski-touring I have arrived at a pack list &amp; travel setup that works very well. </p>

<p>My pack list does cut no corners and allows me to either ski in comfort from a base camp or can be adapted for a Haute-Route-style ski-tour where I sleep each night in a different hut. With changing the backpack I even can take camping equipment and pitch the tent on the top of a summit! For the travelling part this pack list allows me to take a variety of gear but still not feel like I’m an over-loaded donkey. Besides a dedicated ski bag I rely again on the awesome <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/10/one-duffle-to-rule-them-all-the-arcteryx-carrier-duffle.html">Arc’teryx Carrier Duffle</a> to transport gear via bus, train, plane and car, while on tour I’m carrying all I need outdoors in one backpack. It’s a versatile, light and durable list that’s equally suitable for a week of ski-touring in Lyngen or the Alps. </p>

<h2 id="when-skis-travel">When Skis Travel</h2>

<p>Travelling with skis can be easy, comfortable and fun - if you have a <a href="https://www.bergzeit.co.uk/douchebag-the-douchebag-ski-bag/?pid=81">Douchebag</a> to transport your skis. If you look past the name - which is fun in my opinion! - you get a ski bag which transports skis, boots, backpack, poles, avalanche kit and clothes in comfort. My 184 cm long DPS Wailer Tour1 skis fit perfectly into it with room to spare, and the Ribcage construction of the Douchebag ensures the skis and everything else inside stay safe. I have flown thousands of kilometers with the Douchebag, travlled hundreds of kilometers by train and car and the Douchebag has never let me down. Thanks to the two large wheels it is easy to pull the ski bag through airports and streets, and best of all: If not needed it can be rolled up into a compact little package which takes up little space. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25897550964/in/dateposted/" title="The Douchebag rolled up"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1492/25897550964_a09fd56363_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="The Douchebag rolled up" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>If I travel inside the Douchebag I put:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://bit.ly/1paqW0r">DPS Wailer Tour1 Skis</a> with <a href="https://www.bergzeit.co.uk/g3-ion-12-touring-binding/?pid=81">G3 Ion 12 Binding</a></li>

  <li>As well as a variety of gear from the clothing and backpack section</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-backpack">The Backpack</h2>

<p><em>Airbag or normal ski-touring bag</em>, that was the question I asked myself as I set out to add yet another backpack to the collection. While I’d love to have an <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/12/arcteryx-voltair-avalanche-airbag.html">Arc’teryx Voltair Avalanche Airbag</a> I settled for the lighter <a href="http://bit.ly/1pari78">Black Diamond Dawn Patrol 25 Pack</a> with the <a href="http://bit.ly/23GxUgv">Black Diamond Avalung Element</a>. It’s a reasonably light pack with an avy pocket in the front, a spacious google pocket and a large main compartment that’s opened via a zipper in the back panel - this keeps gear out of the snow. I also can carry my helmet at the front of the pack, and also the skis or a snowboard attach to the Dawn Patrol 25. If I travel I usually take this backpack also as a carry-on, and it fits my 15” MBP nicely into the main compartment with room to spare for cables, a book and more. </p>

<p>Getting that all in can be a real Tetris-like experience, especially if the Hut-to-Hut stuff comes in, too! And of course, depending on where I am out, also a map, compass and a watch with GPS &amp; Altimeter are along.</p>

<h2 id="layering-for-ski-touring">Layering for ski-touring</h2>

<p>Layering for ski-touring is much like <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/02/layering-guide-how-to-dress-for-winter.html">layering for winter</a>. I wear a thin baselayer, thin midlayers, if it is cold an insulation vest, and depending on the weather either a softshell or a hardshell top &amp; bottom. I try to only take either shell layer along to save weight &amp; space, but depending on the weather forecast can be a bit risky. The underneath garments have proven themselves and work very well for me and I can recommend each piece. Besides that they also are comfortabl and look cool on photos.</p>

<h2 id="the-hut-to-hut-extras">The Hut-to-Hut Extras</h2>

<p>My Hut-to-Hut Extras include a silk inlet which I bought many years ago, as it is more hygienic and is wished for by hut owners, and some spare clothes. While I maintain the principle that I’m on a ski-tour and not on a fashion show it is nice to switch into dry and non-smelly clothes after a day on the mountain. I usually switch into dry underwear, socks and put on the shirt, while wearing the Northern Playground Ziplongs. I pack it all in an <a href="https://www.bergzeit.de/eagle-creek-pack-it-specter-quarter-cube-white-strobe/?pid=81">Eagle Creek Pack-It Specter Quarter Cube</a> which fits well into my pack, right between the ION ski crampons.</p>

<h2 id="the-camping-extras">The Camping Extras</h2>

<p>Sometimes you just want to pitch the tent on the summit, take the stove out and watch the stars and Northern Lights. Depending on the need of the tent it can be <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/09/hyperlite-mountain-gear-ultamid.html">lighter</a> or heavier, but what’s sure is that I need a larger backpack to carry it and the other kit! We’re having this planned for next week up north in Lyngen, so stay tuned on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hendrikm/">Instagram</a> for a <em>“tent on summit under Northern Lights”</em> shot. </p>

<h2 id="at-basecamp">At Basecamp</h2>

<p>Often my ski-touring trips also involve staying in a town, which means after a day on the mountain I can jump into the Sauna, eat some tasty food and drink a beer. I usually have an extra nice-looking shirt along (the <a href="https://www.norrona.com/en-GB/Products/3360-14/1011/falketind-long-sleeve-shirt-m/">Norrøna falketind Longsleeve</a> is a favourite), but otherwise I wear the clothes I am also travelling in (usually an <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/houdini-thrill-twill-pants-jeans/">Houdini Thrill Twill Pants</a> or the <a href="http://amzn.to/1SpbZoV">Icebreaker Seeker Pants</a> and the awesome <a href="http://partner.bergfreunde.de/go.cgi?pid=10239&amp;wmid=cc&amp;cpid=1&amp;subid=SkiPackList&amp;target=https://www.bergfreunde.de/ortovox-rnw-cool-double-check-shirt-long-sleeve-hemd/?_$ja=tsid:52154">Ortovox R’N’W Cool Double Check Shirt</a>). If you’re into Aprés skiing you probably wanna take more, I myself am happy to read a book and go to sleep reasonably early!</p>

<p>So, that’s my ski-touring packing list. A versatile list that uses only two pieces of check-in luggage - with some packing magic I also can get everything into the DOuchebag, but then it can get close to the 23 kg weight limit on most flights. The Arc’teryx Carrier Duffle also packs nicely down over the wheels of the Douchebag which means I can pull both bags, and the BD pack comes along as a carry-on. <strong>Happy travelling &amp; skiing!</strong></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ski-touring, that’s walking - skinning in skiing terms - the mountain up and then skiing it down. It’s a great way to enjoy the mountains in winter and has similarities to hiking. But much unlike the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/gear-reviews/">light trailrunners</a> I use from spring till autumn, in winter you need a ski boot. Happily I found after much research &amp; pondering a boot which is light and performs great on the way up &amp; down.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26149591360/in/album-72157666988623142/" title="La Sportiva Spectre, ready for skiing"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1447/26149591360_9f3fcceb75_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="La Sportiva Spectre, ready for skiing" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>I bought the Spectre after much research last November from the Bergfreunde, and have used it ski-touring in Canada, Finland, Austria, Switzerland and South Tyrol since, all in all over 20 days. It coming along to Lyngen next week, too!</p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>A ski-touring boot has two modes: A Walk mode for skinning up the mountain and a ski-mode to come down again. The walk mode gives you freedom of movement for sliding the ski forward while you skin up, and the ski mode makes the boot stiff so you can transfer your power onto the binding and ski.  Normal Alpine Skiing boots miss the walk feature, and while you might be able to skin up short sections for serious ascents you want a <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/tourenskischuhe/">ski boot</a> with a walk mode. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25184029286/in/album-72157664166747400/" title="At the start of the ski-tour"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1495/25184029286_5212fe5fdc_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="At the start of the ski-tour" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>As told by La Sportiva, the Spectre comes with these features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>4 Buckles plus optional Power Strap</li>
  <li>60° Range of Motion</li>
  <li>120 Flex</li>
  <li>3 preset Forward Lean options: 10°, 14° and 18°</li>
  <li>Tech and AT Bindings compatible</li>
  <li>Dynafit inserts</li>
  <li>Rockered Vibram Sole</li>
  <li>Carbon Reinforced Grilamid Vertebra</li>
  <li>Marfram Spoiler</li>
  <li>Pebax Cuff</li>
  <li>Grilamid Shell</li>
  <li>Sole length xxx mm in MP 26.5</li>
  <li>Dual Density EZ Thermo liner</li>
  <li>And it is Made in Italy</li>
</ul>

<p>In the box you’ll find besides the boots two optional laces which allow you to get a tighter fit of the liner on your foot, two insoles, a few patches and tools.</p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>The Pegasus Buckles, which are flat when open which means they don’t snag on stuff close to your feet, and can comfortably be worn underneath your pants, are great. The buckles on my other ski-touring boot don’t lay flat so these are definitely more convenient in use. Additionally you can Micro-adjust the buckles for a perfect fit. The very low weight for a four-buckle boot is also a great achievement by La Sportiva.</p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>I haven’t been easy on the boots, and they have flown several thousands of miles across the globe in my <a href="https://www.bergzeit.de/douchebag-the-douchebag-skitasche-pitch-black/?pid=81">Douchebag</a>, skied and skinned thousands of meters, climbed ice in them and walked through town in them, and they still look good and only have minor scratches.</p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>My Size 26.5 Spectres weigh with liner 1374 g, that’s 240 g for the liner boot and 1134 g for the shell. The <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/12/arcteryx-procline-carbon-lite-ski-boot.html">Arc’teryx Procline Carbon Lite Ski Boot</a> is lighter, but I haven’t used it yet.</p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p><em>My experience is based on skiing the Spectre with <a href="http://bit.ly/22PDNaU">DPS Wailer 99 Tour1 Skis</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/20DPCfk">G3 ION 12 Bindings</a>.</em></p>

<p>There’s plenty of opinions on the Spectre - from people that really dislike the boot to ones that love it, and everything in between. There’s two things why I don’t love the boot outright: And that are the two blisters on my feet. After hiking in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/10/inov-8-trailroc-235.html">Trailrunners</a> for over seven years, climbing in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/01/scarpa-rebel-ultra-gtx.html">Mountaineering boots</a> for four and <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2011/01/backcountry-cross-country-skiing.html">XC skiing</a> in good boots since six years I haven’t had blisters anymore. But on my second ski-touring trip this year to <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/02/ski-touring-south-tyrol-and-salzburger-lungau.html">South Tyrol</a> and Salzburger Lungau, on the second day blisters appeared on the inside of my ankles. Compeed helped in allowing me to ski the next few weeks, but even after the blister healed they were there again after a day of skiing on the next trip. Blisters are no fun, and while I happily bite my teeth together and continue to wear the boots I think I either will need to go with them to a good boot fitter (which, sadly, we don’t have in Vaasa) or try my hand at modifying the boot on my own; and as it is made from Grilamid which tends to hold its shape once punched (unlike Pebax, another plastic which is often used in the construction of ski boots) that might be a good option too. These problems came after moulding the liner twice and the shell once, by the way. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26149572410/in/album-72157666988623142/" title="Liner &amp; insole"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1650/26149572410_5f4caf3e9f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Liner &amp; insole" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Getting into the boot is easy for me, I have narrow feet and wear medium-thickness to thin skiing socks, and the shell has a medium to narrow heel fit, a narrow instep and has a medium forefoot last. The top buckles can be moved out of the way for easily getting in (and out) of the boot. After a day of touring getting out of the boot needs a bit of pulling - nothing difficult, though, and if I open all buckles it’s super-simple to get out. It’s recommended to play around with the boot and find the right adjustments for your style of skiing, and as the Spectre allows a host of possibilities to adjust it to your foot &amp; style - take the time to do it, you will have more fun in the long-run. Stepping in to the pin-binding of your choice is easy thanks to the two indicators on each side of the boot, these make it easy to align the boot with the pins and then push down so they snap into the fittings.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26422447775/in/album-72157666988623142/" title="Aligned"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1553/26422447775_1186807e11_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Aligned" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Other reviewers seem to take issues with the buckles. Yes, they’re different: You can micro-adjust them to your needs via the screw, and it takes some learning to get the hole placed over the stud - and it won’t snap over it unless you get the alignment correctly. I didn’t have any issues with them and found the system easy, and you can even adjust the buckles when you’re in the boot. I really liked the low profile buckle design which fits perfectly under the ski pants and does provide a cleaner profile &amp; prevents trees, rocks and stuff from catching the buckles, which protects them from being damaged and makes them last longer.</p>

<p>The Liner is warm and I never had cold feet in them. I needed to add the included lacing for them to move less on my foot while touring. It has a flex zone that helps in touring mode. The two loops at the front and back make it easy to pull the boot on. The liner keeps your sweaty feet smell well, so if you’re a connoisseur of such things you’re in luck. Otherwise you might want to dry and air them well before taking them in. </p>

<p>The sticky rubber sole is great and allows for great grip when scrambling or walking in town and slippery ski stations. The yellow areas at the toe and heel are more durable, and the higher arch minimizes snow-build-up in my experience. The Spectre is crampons compatible and my <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/camp-xlc-470-steigeisen/">CAMP XLC Crampons</a> are a great companion with them and make for an ultralight ski-mountaineering setup.</p>

<p>Alright, so getting in the boot is all swell, skinning up is great because the boot is light with a great range of motion, but what about switching into ski mode at the wind-blasted summit and the descent? I’m happy to report that it takes only a minute, it at all, to close all buckles and switch the boot into ski mode and if you have a wide ski pants you can even do it while the pants and snow-gaiter are down over the buckles (I have been using a <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/norroena-lyngen-driflex3-pants-hardshellhose/">Norrøna Lyngen softshell pants</a> and a <a href="http://www.arcteryx.com/product.aspx?language=EN&amp;gender=mens&amp;collection=Whiteline&amp;model=Stinger-Pant">Arc’teryx Stinger Pants</a> which both allowed to do this). Fussing around with boots at a windy &amp; cold summit is no fun, even less if you need to take the gloves off, and with the Spectre I was quickly ready to ski down. </p>

<p>I found the Spectre a stiff boot when tightly buckled down for the descent, and find it has good control and power transmission that could easily control my fat DPS Wailers on almost all snow conditions (hard, icy slopes in resorts are tough and my skis started flutter, but that’s another story). Buckled down the boot still had plenty of room in the toe box for warm toes, I haven’t experienced any shin bang which I thank the Booster Strap for, and the black EZ Flex area on the tongue gives a nice flex in downhill mode. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25817614954/in/album-72157666988623142/" title="Open!"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1592/25817614954_1d2f98d371_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Open!" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Some 20+ days are not really yet enough to give a comment on durability, so I will save that for a later time. But what’s worth discussing is the price of the Spectre. If you have read till here you might think that such a lightweight, innovative boot probably must cost a little fortune. Well, it does not. The regular, recommended price is around 490€ - but thanks to never-ending sales you can pick up the Spectre for as little as 370€. Even at the recommended price it’s an affordable ski boot, and if you can get it with a discount it is a lot cheaper than many other boots.</p>

<h2 id="could-be-better">Could be better</h2>

<p>La Sportiva decided to update the Spectre for 2016/ 2017, which should address some of the issues described above and allow for even more customization. Even if I try hard, I can not imagine something to complain about this boot - I think the blisters are something that just happened and because I want to keep these boot it is something I need to find a way to solve &amp; life with.</p>

<h2 id="competing-products">Competing Products</h2>

<p>There’s a wide variety of <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/tourenskischuhe/">ski-touring boot</a> available, I myself also own the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/marken/scarpa/tourenskischuhe/">Scarpa Maestrale RS</a>, and many people like the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/dynafit-tlt-6-mountain-cr-tourenskischuhe/">Dynafit TLT 6</a>. In the end you should follow my final advice in the bottomline when it comes to buying boots.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26356257591/in/album-72157666988623142/" title="Spectre"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1505/26356257591_719db2aea1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Spectre" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>I decided the buy the Spectre because it is the lightest four buckle boot and would allow me an easier time on the way up - where I’d need to move the 1374 g per foot hundreds of times - and great control on the way down. So far it has performed great, and aside from the blisters which I hope to solve with some punches on the shell I imagine the boot will accompany for the next few ski-touring seasons. The Spectre is comfortable &amp; light on the way up and performs great on the way down, especially in powder. I love the low buckle design as they fit very well under my ski pants, the comfortable walking in town, and the cool look of the boot is also something I don’t get tired of. The light weight also make them good for climbing, be it rock or ice. Add in the amazing price and you have a boot which I am very happy with!</p>

<p><em>But the ultimate Bottomline for ski-boots is simple: If the boot fits and is comfortable, buy it. You might have the luck that your feet fit the Spectre out of the box, or they might not suit you at all - the general wisdom for ski boots is to buy a boot that fits you well, because everything else might end up in pain.</em></p>
