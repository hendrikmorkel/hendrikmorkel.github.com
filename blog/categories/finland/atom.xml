<h2 id="hetta">Hetta</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.tosilappi.fi">Hetta</a> is in the far, far north of Finland and that means: Lots of snow, crispy cold temperatures, Northern Lights and beautiful sunny days in spring. Last year we spent our winter holiday in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/04/winter-family-adventures-in-pyha-luosto.html">Pyhä</a> and this year we decided to visit another small and family-friendly town: Hetta. Right in the heart of Lapland it is located at the top of the <a href="http://www.nationalparks.fi/pallas-yllastunturinp">Pallas-Yllästunturi National Park</a> and the starting point of the <a href="http://www.nationalparks.fi/hettapallashikingtrail">Hetta-Pallas Trail</a> which you can ski in winter or hike in the summer. <a href="http://www.nationalparks.fi/poyrisjarvi">Pöyrisjärvi Wilderness Area</a> and <a href="http://www.nationalparks.fi/tarvantovaara">Tarvantovaara Wilderness Area</a> are right around the corner, and it isn’t far to Norway, either - which makes it an ideal base camp for outdoor and nature lovers in summer &amp; winter.</p>

<p>It has all that a winter enthusiast needs: Cafés &amp; <a href="http://www.tosilappi.fi/en/services/restaurants/">Restaurants</a>, various <a href="http://www.tosilappi.fi/en/accommodation/">accommodation options</a>, a supermarket and various other shops, the <a href="http://www.nationalparks.fi/felllaplandvisitorcentre">Fell Lapland Visitor Centre</a> and lots of stuff to do, from skiing on the local hill to enjoying the silence on a Husky Sled ride. With six days in Hetta we had plenty of time to try various <a href="http://www.tosilappi.fi/en/things-to-do/winter/">activities</a> and experience what the town has to offer.</p>

<h2 id="outside-with-hetta-huskies">Outside with Hetta Huskies</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.hettahuskies.com/en">Hetta Huskies</a> are probably one of the most well-known companies from Hetta, and if you meet the dogs, owners and Guides it is clear why: The dogs are lovely and will make your trip unforgettable, while the owners Pasi &amp; Anna with their friendly, international staff of Guides will ensure you have a great experience - be it just a few hours or a week!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26122490546/in/album-72157665518007630/" title="Hetta Huskies"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1550/26122490546_2d432ac709_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Hetta Huskies" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We were with the whole family - my four year old son, baby, wife and me - on the <a href="http://www.hettahuskies.com/en/activities/single-day-safaris">Silent Landscapes</a> Safari, in which you get a tour of the Farm, meet the dogs, get instructed on how to ride the sleigh and then are off into the winter wonderland for around 45 minutes. It’s was a great and interesting experience that we all enjoyed, especially our son thought it was a lot of fun (the baby slept!). We were accompanied by a guide who stayed mostly away but helped when the need arose - we had a small change in the configuration of dogs, for example. After I got instructed in riding the sleigh the family sat down and then we were off to the mires. I always love to explore swamps in winter, their vast area and wide views are beautiful to behold and in winter you can explore them without mosquitos and wet feet. We could see the distant fjells of the National Park, rode through the forest and loved the silence of nature. We could have gone much longer - and the dogs, too! - but after 45 minutes we were back at the farm where we helped bringing the dogs back to their compounds and said thanks for their great service!</p>

<h2 id="a-visit-to-the-hetta-snow-castle">A visit to the Hetta Snow Castle</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.nakkala.com">Näkkälä Eräpalvelut</a> offers visits to their Snow Castle which is a short 20 minute snowmobile ride over the frozen lake away from Hetta. The castle is open from the end of November and still stands there in the end of June and with walls several meters thick that’s no surprise! The kids loved it and it is easy to understand why they were fascinated by the ice castle: Consisting of three domed rooms they were adorned with ice sculptures, an ice bar and tables as well as a frozen bed! You can sleep in the ice castle, too! After exploring the snow castle for a while we had hot juice and then it was again back to Hetta in the sleigh. A great activity for the morning or afternoon after which you might find yourself again outside trying to build your own snow igloo!</p>

<h2 id="skiing-at-hetta-hiihtomaa">Skiing at Hetta Hiihtomaa</h2>

<p>If you <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hendrikm/">follow me on Instagram</a> you probably have realized that I have been ski-touring a lot this winter. <a href="http://www.hettahiihtomaa.fi">Hetta Hiihtomaa</a> is the local skiing hill and we took the chance for our son to learn a bit of skiing and I too took a ride in the lift up to go down through the snow-covered forest. The service at Hetta Hiihtomaa was superb, the two Gentlemen were super-friendly and helpful with <a href="http://www.hettahiihtomaa.fi/p/valinevuokraus.html">loaning the gear</a> and sharing local knowledge. Besides the lift and ski-rental there’s also a Café, a big sledding hill and a illuminated XC Loipe. The prizes are very affordable when compared to the large ski areas, and the people and kids all had a lot of fun on the slopes or off-piste. Hetta Hiihtomaa has also a small beginner’s hill which is excellent for learning to ski, and I can totally recommend the sledding hill, too! </p>

<h2 id="ski-touring-into-the-white--out-at-nkklvaara">Ski-touring into the White (-Out) at Näkkälävaara</h2>

<p>What I like more than skiing at a resort is going into the backcountry, and I was fortunate enough to go out for a morning with Riikka from <a href="http://www.wildriver.fi">Wild River Nature Adventures</a>. We decided it’d be a good idea to go to Näkkälä, a tiny village some 30 minutes from Hetta, where we’d tour up to the local fjell, Näkkälävaara. It’s an easy tour with a really cool descent through a birch forest and I had a huge smile on my face after the cool run down! </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25546895203/in/album-72157665518007630/" title="Yay!"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1464/25546895203_30c25d623d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Yay!" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>We started next to one of the few houses and then toured over a narrow lake to the foot of the fjell. It was a cold day and a mist was hanging in the air, which would before long engulf us as we started the climb up the hill. The visibility was soon just a couple dozen metre, and first as we were starting the descent the weather cleared a bit to give a few views price. Nevertheless it was beautiful to tour through the white landscape, with trees hidden under thick covers of snow &amp; ice, arctic hare tracks running across the hill and the wind being the only sound wide &amp; far. At the summit we waited for half an hour for the weather to clear, as you could see till Pyhäkero to the south and the mountains in Norway to the north, as well as the large Pöyrisjärvi lake. Alas, they stayed all hidden! </p>

<p>After the superb descent we skied along the lake, past the rental cabins of <a href="http://www.nakkala.com/kampat/">Näkkälä Eräpalvelut</a> and to a sacred rock of the Sami, which showed ancient reindeer paintings. Too soon we were back at the car and on our way back to Hetta, where we encountered many reindeer next to the road - and the sun also came out! There’s plenty of great ski-touring around Hetta, from the majestic Pyhäkero to smaller fjells in the area. Grab a map and go out explore!</p>

<h2 id="tasty-lappish-food">Tasty Lappish food</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.hetan-majatalo.fi/en">Hotel Hetan Majatalo</a> has every Friday a Lappish Buffet which is super-tasty. Reindeer, salmon, mashed potatoes and a tasty dessert along with a great home-brewed beer it is something you should treat yourself to. </p>

<p>Also the buffet at the Lapland Hotel Hetta was very tasty, with a wide variety of salads for startes, wish and meat mains and several sweet desserts. Add in a good selection of wines and beers with great service and you have a great evening!</p>

<h2 id="enjoying-the-silence-of-xc-skiing">Enjoying the silence of XC skiing</h2>

<p>As we stayed in a cottage next to the lake and there’s around 100 km of skiing tracks (here’s the <a href="http://www.tosilappi.fi/wp-content/uploads/Hetan-alueen-latukartta.pdf">map</a>) going XC skiing is something that you can do any time of the day - even at night, as there’s illuminated tracks, too! I took my son in a Pulka for a few hours of skiing along, which is a great way to be outdoors. XC skiing is relatively easy, you go at a low speed and thus still can experience the nature around you but it’s fast enough to feel good after a few hours outside. </p>

<h2 id="learning-about-sami-culture-at-the-fell-lapland-visitor-centre">Learning about Sami Culture at the Fell Lapland Visitor Centre</h2>

<p>If the weather is so bad that you don’t want to be outside, head to the wonderful <a href="http://www.nationalparks.fi/en/felllaplandvisitorcentre">Fell Lapland Visitor Centre</a>. It’s open every day of the week, has also a Café with tasty cakes and pastries and the exhibitions are free of charge - hence an ideal way to spend an afternoon. There’s even a very nice children’s corner which our son enjoyed playing at! The main exhibition shows the eight seasons of the Sámi and how their life has changed over the time. To take it all in a couple of hours would be needed I reckon, though it is easy to spend even more time there to also explore the small library and the two other exhibitions.</p>

<h2 id="more-things-to-see--do">More things to see &amp; do</h2>

<p>Hetta has many other things to offer, from festivals like the Nordic Ice &amp; Snow Sculpture competition at the end of February over regular Nature evenings in the Museum to the <a href="http://saamiskirace.fi">Saami Ski Race</a> in April. You can view the <a href="http://www.tosilappi.fi/en/events/">events</a> here. There’s also two silver smiths in Hetta which are worth checking out and a church which is architecturally interesting. It’s not far to Kilpisjärvi, either, or you could go for a day trip over to Alta in Norway. If you’re looking for a few days in nature you could ski from Pallas to Hetta through the fjells (or vice versa) and you even can ski onwards to Näkkälä. </p>

<p><strong>Where to stay?</strong></p>

<p>We stayed at the <a href="http://www.tosilappi.fi/en/ounistieva-en/">Ounistieva Cottage</a> which is a nice cottage a bit out of town right next to the lake. It’s a self-service cottage with a nice wood-heated sauna, a warm wood stove and you can go XC skiing from the doorstep, which is awesome. Cottages are great for families as you can be as loud as you want, the kids can play safely outside in the snow and there’s plenty of space inside. If you prefer something more central then we can recommend the <a href="http://www.hetan-majatalo.fi">Hotel Hetan Majatalo</a> and the <a href="https://www.laplandhotels.com/EN/hotels-in-lapland/hetta/lapland-hotel-hetta.html">Lapland Hotel Hetta</a> which are close to the centre of town and also have their own Restaurants with great food. Their rooms, especially in the Hetan Majatalo, are very cozy and it’s nice to have breakfast &amp; dinner served each evening. There’s several more <a href="http://www.tosilappi.fi/en/accommodation/">accommodation options in Hetta</a> for every budget, so have a look around and find what suits you!</p>

<p><strong>How to get there?</strong></p>

<p>We travelled with a combination of <a href="https://www.vr.fi/cs/vr/fi/etusivu">train</a> and <a href="https://www.sixt.fi">car</a> instead of driving all the way up north, with a night in Rovaniemi on the way up and down - if you have small kids it is more comfortable this way, for everyone really. In the train the kids can play, nap and go easily to the toilet, and the ride from Rovaniemi to Hetta takes only around four hours by car - much better than the 12+ hours of driving it would take from Vaasa! And if you come from abroad - just fly straight to <a href="https://www.finavia.fi/en/enontekio/">Enontekiö Airport</a>! </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Where to go backpacking this year?</em>, it’s the same question each spring. I have for five years being advocating hiking in Finland, and since last year you can now take my <a href="http://www.conrad-stein-verlag.de/p/verlag/show_book.html?isbn=978-3-86686-319-4&amp;edition=1&amp;t=1395048047963">Pirkan Taival Hiking Guide</a> along on your trip on this wonderful trail in the heart of Finland. Reason enough to introduce you to the book and encourage you to come backpacking on the Pirkan Taival!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9537611324/" title="Dusk by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7312/9537611324_1787dd85ec_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Dusk" /></a></p>

<p>Writing a book, even a little one like my Pirkan Taival Travel Guide, is a lot of work. First there’s the hiking and collecting data: 300 km of trails were hiked several times, XC skiing trails were explored in the winter, and I went off-trail over frozen lakes with snowshoes and through blooming forests to find the best spots and areas to showcase in the book. After all that outdoors time it’s time to distill it all into a smart format, organize maps, work with the local authorities, find photos from my extensive library, and then put it into a logical whole. </p>

<p>However, I was lucky that I didn’t need to take care of the layout, printing, and drawing maps - that’s what the fabulous team from the <a href="http://www.conrad-stein-verlag.de/p/verlag/verlag_home.html">Conrad Stein Verlag</a> took care off, who is my Publisher. They got the book looking really great and into the book stores across Germany, Austria and Switzerland, from <a href="http://www.freytagberndt.at/rtc-freytagberndt/805">Freytag &amp; Berndt</a> to the <a href="http://geobuchhandlung.eshop.t-online.de/epages/Store3_Shop37170.sf/de_DE/?ObjectID=15498754">Geobuchhandlung Kiel</a> and <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/conrad-stein-finnland-pirkan-taival/">Bergzeit</a> - walk into any of the thousands of book stores in Germany and you can either pick up the book right away or get it the next day.</p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/Y9r5yz" title="Finnland: Pirkan Taival book by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5514/9156957955_7af63cca08_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Finnland: Pirkan Taival book" /></a></p>

<p>For me it was a great pleasure to go hiking on the Pirkan Taival and write about it: I often was accompanied by good friends and <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/guided-trips/">clients</a> on the trail with whom I could share my love of the outdoors. I saw the trail in each season - in early spring I was hiking through knee-deep snow, on dark and rainy autumns I listend to the rain on my tarp, during sunny summer nights the call of Swans was echoing over the lakes and sitting besides a warm fire in winter. With the book you’re able to plan and hike the Pirkan Taival yourself in any season, and see all those beautiful places along the trail. It’s easy to reach by public transportation, and you can be within half a working day from your door step to the start of the trail in Finland, which makes it excellent for even just a long weekend hike if you need a Nordic outdoor-fix.</p>

<p>But don’t just believe me: Hear <a href="http://outdoorseite.de/trekking-in-finnland-mit-hendrik-durch-den-pirkan-taival/">what Axel has to say about my book</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.de/product-reviews/3866863195/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&amp;showViewpoints=1">read the reviews</a>, then <a href="http://www.trekkingmagazin.com/touren/pirkan-taival-erholung-pur-im-suden-finnlands">read my trekking Magazin article</a> and browse my <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/destinations/">trip reports</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Then</strong> you can go and get the book from your local book shop in Austria, Switzerland and Germany, online from <a href="http://www.freytagberndt.at/rtc-freytagberndt/805">Freytag &amp; Berndt</a>, <a href="http://geobuchhandlung.eshop.t-online.de/epages/Store3_Shop37170.sf/de_DE/?ObjectID=15498754">Geobuchhandlung Kiel</a>, <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/conrad-stein-finnland-pirkan-taival/">Bergzeit</a>, <a href="http://amzn.to/Y9r5yz">Amazon.de</a> or directly from the <a href="http://www.conrad-stein-verlag.de/p/verlag/show_book.html?isbn=978-3-86686-319-4&amp;edition=1&amp;t=1395048047963">Conrad Stein Verlag</a>. </p>

<p><em>The book is in German! I might write an English or Finnish version in the future =)</em></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m not a big fan of November backpacking. Though somehow that hasn’t hindered me in the last years to plan week-long backpacking trips in what I find the worst time of the year. And to top things off, I always manage to convince other people to join me on the trips. These time my companions came from as far away as Japan and the United States of America, to experience what Finland (<em>does not</em>) have to offer in November. <em>An Ultralight Summit trip report.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/11943410053/" title="UL Summit 2013 View?"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2842/11943410053_ca62a790f6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="UL Summit 2013 View?" /></a></p>

<p>We had big plans for the Ultralight Summit last year. That we’d be hiking in November in Finland wasn’t part of it, but if you manage to </p>

<ul>
  <li>Keep busy</li>
  <li>Still want to meet with your friends</li>
  <li>Need to write a story about <a href="http://www.outdoors.fi/destinations/nationalparks/koli/Pages/Default.aspx">Koli</a></li>
  <li>Said friends want to go hiking in Finland</li>
</ul>

<p>Well, you catch my drift. Benjamin, Jotaro, Takashi and Hideyuki arrived in early November in Helsinki, and on a Monday morning at 7:12 o’clock we sat in a train to Joensuu. Four and half hours in a train with free Wifi, electric outlets and a decent Board Restaurant can still be long, and it was nice to stretch the legs shortly in Joensuu before getting a ride from a good friend to Koli. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/11943558004/" title="UL Summit 2013 Koli Visitor Centre"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7335/11943558004_7205d851ba_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="UL Summit 2013 Visitor Centre" /></a>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/11943394843/" title="UL Summit 2013 Ukko-Koli view by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5538/11943394843_395f411f1b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="UL Summit 2013 Ukko-Koli view" /></a></p>

<p>And then we are there. Nearly at the top of this 400 something metre high hill, there’s a sweet looking hotel (although in cold wind probably any hotel looks sweet &amp; inviting) and a visitor centre - which, with our luck, was closed. Good timing, there. We tried to reach Takashi and Hideyuki who traveled here already a few days earlier, but as we couldn’t reach them we set off towards Ukko-Koli, Akka-Koli and Paha-Koli, the three peaks from where one has very nice views over the lake towards <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2010/10/from-russia-with-love.html">Russia</a>. It’s as we stand on the third peak that I get a message from Takashi - they’re at the hotel now, where shall we meet? Ten minutes later - Takashi and Hideyuki ran <a href="http://www.theomm.com/events/">The OMM</a> in Wales before they came to Finland - we meet, and agree to get together at the first camp spot later. </p>

<p>While Ben, Jotaro and me set off, the weather is changing from cloudy and windy to cloudy, windy and drizzly with increasing Darkness™. We descent from the Koli peaks, past pastures of old, over soft grass fields, along a bit of road until we ascent and head for the Kota at Ryläys. It’s pitch black and snowing as we hike via duckboards over a hanging bog towards the Kota, and are quite relieved as we see the humble abode for the night.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/11943963106/" title="UL Summit 2013 Joulu Olut"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5495/11943963106_7b2fd9c207_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="UL Summit 2013 Joulu Olut" /></a></p>

<p>We saw and chop wood and the fire is just going as Hideyuki &amp; Takashi arrive. We welcome them to our massive shelter for the night, put on a couple more logs, and I finally can get the heavy load I carried till here out: To celebrate this first night I brought a <a href="http://www.olvi.fi/web/fi/68">Olvi Joulu Olut</a> for everyone along - well over 1,6 kg! I reckon this makes the first night sort of a <a href="http://www.backpackingnorth.com/2013/07/brovernighter-with-korpijaakko.html">Brovernighter™</a>. Anyway. Fire. Shelter. Snow. <a href="http://locusgear.com/products-2/bivys/pneuma-bivy-event?lang=en">A new bivy</a>. After eating well I decide to take the new bivy outside into the snow and sleep there - it’s the perfect, safe opportunity to do so. I slide into the red bivy, snow falling strongly around me, zip it almost closed, change socks, and fall asleep. Three hours later I wake up, and decide that it was enough - the top of my <a href="http://bit.ly/18Wo3Sr">sleeping bag</a> was a bit moist, and I rather have a completely dry sleeping bag, so I pack the whole shebang up, sneak inside, put another log on the fire so I see something, and fall asleep next to my fellow lightweight backpacking friends.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/11943566324/" title="UL Summit 2013 Kota"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2816/11943566324_02f2cf419c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="UL Summit 2013 Kota" /></a>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/11943133225/" title="UL Summit 2013 Warm &amp; comfy"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2875/11943133225_52edba0b99_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="UL Summit 2013 Warm &amp; comfy" /></a></p>

<p>The next morning we’re in winter wonderland. Everything is white - the trail, the kota, the trees, the ground. We smile. Light the fire. Eat breakfast. Enjoy the silence of the snow, the mist in the tree tops, we wander around the cozy Kota with its warm fire inside. But even the cosiest Kotas can not hold back eager backpackers, and so a while later five hikers emerge from the wooden structure, around them the snow melting &amp; dripping from trees. The thermometer has slipped just a degree or two above Zero, enough to make the snow starting to melt and dribble on us. </p>

<p>We ascent the hill we’re on, upwards to the look-out tower with the broken ladder. It’s so misty that we wouldn’t have seen further than 50 m from up there either way, and so we walk a bit further, have a group photo at the “Waterfall of Rocks” (hidden in the mist) and continue. The trail winds along the top of a ridge, goes a bit down into the forests where we cross fast flowing small streams by jumping from tree roots to tree roots, and then ascents again a few dozen meters, back to hard, wet granite under our trail runners. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/11943394503/" title="UL Summit 2013 Reflections"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5475/11943394503_24d07604b6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="UL Summit 2013 Reflections" /></a>

<p>Then comes the moment that Hideyuki &amp; Takashi need to turn back. As they came before us, they will leave us already today. I show them on the map that it might be faster to come with us another few kilometres to one of the forest roads, which should be quicker to hike back to the Visitor Centre. But the two, quite rightly in hindsight, decide to hike the same way back we just came. They just finished The OMM, so this certainly isn’t a problem for them. As we say our good byes, it always feels a bit sad to say bye to people whose company you enjoy, but that’s life. We’ll hike again together this year.</p>

<p>Ben, Jotaro and me carry on, the mist and dripping snow our constant companion while we walk high. As we descend, the snow is largely gone, we can see further, and the trail gets wider. We hike for a while on a forest road, but also here we encounter no one. It’s far past noon as the three of us arrive at a laavu - or the ashen remains of it, all that is left standing a oven in front of the burnt down structure. The wind is blowing strongly from the lake and the fire doesn’t really want to bring our pots with water to a boil, even more wood and a windshield do little to improve the situation. After what seems like forever warm drinks &amp; soups are hungrily consumed, jokes are made, pots cleaned, the fire is put out, and we walk back to the adventure centre. </p>

<p>That’s the desolated adventure centre. A wet hammock swings in the wind, the camping ground - pitching your tent here costs 10€ - is flooded, and the small cabins are all locked. We walk down to the strait, where a rope between two pulleys, connected to a raft, is drifting in the middle of it. We pull the raft to our side of the strait, board it, and while I take action photos of the crossing Jotaro and Ben bring us safely to the other side. There we stand, laughing about this interesting way to cross a water body, take a few more photos, and then head onwards. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/11943959786/" title="UL Summit 2013 Pull!"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7333/11943959786_e793dccfd9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="UL Summit 2013 Pull!" /></a></p>

<p>The path on the island goes very closely along the shore, and often is either flooded, muddy, or both. At a fire place in the centre of the isle we look north from the shore, seeing the mountains we stood on the day before, grey clouds and mist hanging not far above their summits. Water drops from leaf-less twigs paint circles as they hit the lake. We snap photos, have a kuksa of lake water, and continue. The other strait is crossed via a lovely wooden bridge, and we walk along signs telling us that we should stay on the trail. Obvious the summer cottage owners right next to the path have had their fair share of hikers pick their berries.</p>

<p>We hike on as dusk is setting in. It quickly gets dark in the forest, and every time we cross a glade it gets lighter again, the eyes try to adjust, but we’re so quickly in the dark of the trees again, they don’t have time. As we reach the final clearing at Lakkala, it is the camping place we will stay at this night. An old crofters lodge, with various stables, fields and little laavus for the sheep who graze here in the summer is where we will pitch our pyramids this night. Once we found dry spots, that is.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/11943576414/" title="UL Summit 2013 Birch? by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3767/11943576414_1719dff5fa_b.jpg" width="1024" height="341" alt="UL Summit 2013 Birch?" /></a></p>

<p>The field which is designated as a camping place for pitching tarps and tents is ABOUT 75% flooded. Nevertheless, Ben, Jotaro and me find each a spot where our pyramids go up, with enough dry space to unroll our sleeping pads, bivies and quilts. Then the task of making a fire begins. I carried a first load of split logs to the flooded fire circle, and start the task of making feather sticks and building the fire, while Ben &amp; Jotaro carry each a couple of arms full of wood to me. In this rain &amp; wind, we’ll need fuel. Armed with two hands of dry birch bark and half a dozen of feather sticks the fire is roaring in no time. We keep it going strong, the wind blowing in gusts from the lake while the rain keeps falling at a steady pace. Dressed in eVent and Gore-Tex we sit around the fire, split logs as little footstools to keep our soaked trailrunners out of the puddles around the fire. </p>

<p>Despite the miserable weather we sit there, eat, drink and laugh. We put more logs on the fire, trying to find the optimal spot for out titanium pots to boil one more cup of water, and then at 19 o’clock head each to our shelters. In the glow of my headlamp I read a couple more chapters of Terry Pratchett’s latest novel, before I switch the Nao off and lay down. The wind howls over our little shelters, and pulls at the cuben and dyneema cords. But everything holds, and in the next morning I awake as I hear Jotaro’s camera shutter opens and closes. It’s still dark, it’s still wet, and there’s still wind going. Eventually I slip out of my warm down cocoon, into wet socks and shoes which are quickly warmed up by running a few hundred meters on the trails. </p>

<p>A fire is started again in the middle of that puddle while grey clouds race over the sky, giving glimpses of blue. We’re so absorbed with looking at the fire and eating that we are surprised as the sun sends a few rays through the forest in our back. We pack up what is dry, though our shelters are not in that category. We’ll return via another ridge to Ukko-Koli today and a campground close to the town, and as we shoulder the packs, now wonderfully light as less and less food is carried, the sun illuminates the hills on the opposite shore. </p>

<p>The trail is nice today, it changes between hard granite and softly-cushioned pine needles with a few duck boards in between. We get glimpses from the top to the surrounding lakes, forests and hills, but are blasted by a relentlessly cold wind and I’m happy to wear a fleece under my softshell. It doesn’t take us long to come to a crossroad, where we stash the packs behind a tree and hike the kilometre and a bit to the Devil’s Church, a 33 m deep cave in a Z form. Without packs the pace is fast as we hike steadily down. We cross a wide forest road and descent wooden stairs to the cave, and climb in. It is moist, green moss grows on the walls. We spend a little time in there before we head back, all the way up to our rucksacks.</p>

<p>On the next stretch it feels like we spook up Western Capercaillies with every third step. These large birds of the grouse family are in such abundance here that thoughts of a Capercaillie hunt cross my mind. But without a bow &amp; arrows, this idea stay in the realm of fantasy, while the realities are boiling water for soups-in-a-cup with bread and snacks. After our last lunch on the trip, at a fire pit which offered so wet wood that we were well smoked afterwards, we continue for a bit on a forest road. As we come to a junction, where the trail takes a turn into the forest and heads uphill, Jotaro &amp; Ben tell me they’d prefer to continue on the road to the campground. It’s easy enough, so I leave the two and head up the ridge to Mäkrä hill. </p>

<p>I run parts of the trail, happy to go at my own speed, and also in a hurry because the Golden Hour is about to begin any moment now, and I’d rather see it from the top than from the middle. My speed pays off, and I see how the sun sends its last rays towards Russia, while it sinks down behind Sweden, Norway and the lands beyond. The forest opposite of the lake is illuminated by the light, a pulsating movement as clouds whisk by the sun, that descends further and further. I walk along the ridge, more Western Capercaillies taking flight as I approach, and as the western horizons is adorned with an orange band, I take a last look East, then West, and descend. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/11943389463/" title="UL Summit 2013 Golden Hour view towards Russia"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5538/11943389463_1a71e8fe90_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="UL Summit 2013 Golden Hour view towards Russia" /></a></p>

<p>I emerge out of the forest at the Mäkränaho clearing, and choose the wide trail back towards the Visitor Centre. Along the trail I pull the <a href="http://www.bergzeit.co.uk/petzl-nao-headlamp/">Petzl Nao</a> once again out of my <a href="http://www.zpacks.com/accessories/backpack_lid.shtml">ZPacks Multipack</a> as darkness engulfs me. It does not take long for me to reach the Parking Lot of the Visitor Centre, and I run the stairs up to the Hotel &amp; Visitor Centre, where the trail to Turula continues. Again I hike down a wide, well-maintained trail and as I arrive at the campsite Ben &amp; Jotaro have already pitched their shelters. </p>

<p>We gather wood once more from the close by wood-shed, fully-loaded with split logs and generous amounts of birch bark, and soon sit again, with our wet shoes propped up on a log close by the fire, around it. Water we get from a nearby well at a farm-house, but only on the second try we locate the right well - the first one we filled our Platypus bottles up from had E.coli bacteria, as the owner of the house informed us. We sit long around the fire, and are a bit startled as a trailrunner runs past us and our shelters, the beam of his headlamp jumping along the field and roads until it disappears. Before heading to sleep I give my <a href="http://bit.ly/1bcnz0i">NeoAir XLite Sleeping Pad</a> a few additional puffs, before I slip into the <a href="http://bit.ly/18Wo3Sr">Therm-A-Rest Antares sleeping bag</a>. The wind gives a few kind tugs at the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/09/hyperlite-mountain-gear-ultamid.html">UltaMid</a>, and a few raindrops hit the cuben, though overall it is a silent night. </p>

<p>The next morning Ben and Jotaro are well up before me, and I lay long in my sleeping bag. The sound of fire, which Ben started, finally rouses me and I join the two outside. Starbucks Via and a <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/trek-n-eat-muesli-schweizer-art-mit-vollmilch/">Trek’n Eat Swiss Müsli</a> are for breakfast, and especially the latter is superb. I’ve tried many ready-made trekking müslis, and non were good which is why I usually made my own, but this one was so tasty that it’s a serious alternative to MYOM-üsli. </p>

<p>Sleep systems and gear are again packed, shelters shaken to make them a bit less wet, and we set oFf towards the Koli Village. I arranged for a Taxi to pick us up there at 11, but the two kilometres from the campsite to the village, along old Farm buildings on what is in winter a skiing track, does not take us long. We have so much time till the Taxi comes that we sit down in the Café and order salty crepes and coffee, skim through Finland’s worst outdoor magazine, and enjoy being indoors in the warmth after all the snow, rain &amp; wind outside.</p>

<p>Back in Joensuu, civilisation has us back. We visit a lunch place and supermarkets, have coffees and wait till the train takes us back to <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/11/outdoors-in-helsinki.html">Helsinki</a>, where Ben &amp; me will meet <a href="http://www.valppaus.com/">Joni</a> for an overnighter in <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/09/run-or-die-nuuksio-classic-trail-marathon.html">Nuuksio</a>. <em>But that might be another story.</em></p>

<p>The travel up north started in Tampere, the rainy city which welcomed us with sunshine. A good omen? Possibly. Re-packing, dinner, beer, and off to the night train. A cabin was paid for, 30€ extra well spent as it meant we arrived rested in Rovaniemi. Also here: Sunshine. A stroll to the waiting bus, backpacks down into the luggage compartment, and off we went. We turn right past the glass igloos and arrive four hours later at Kilopää Station, a packed parking lot letting us wonder how many people we would meet this week. But once we passed the bus-loads of pensioners on their way up to the Kilopää summit and back down, people got fewer. And once we left the marked trail behind, they disappeared.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9763646456/" title="Wideangle"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5462/9763646456_3764c0da5e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Wideangle" /></a></p>

<p>At the Rautulampi hut we drink tea. We meet a few people, but it being so early we decide to push on. A short bit on trail, before we leave it behind again. After the yellow birches: Wide views. We arrive at the hut, and decide to stay in it. Water is boiled, food eaten, drinks drunk, fire made. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9763854414/" title="Navigation in autumn can be colourful"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7382/9763854414_9995bc480b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Navigation in autumn can be colourful" /></a></p>

<p>We leave under a grey sky the next morning, but the sun comes through once in a while. The trail disappears at times, but we arrive at the first bridge after a couple of hours, lunch, tea, and off into the wild again. Traversing a mountain till we reach the other “bridge”. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9763631271/" title="Bridge"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3809/9763631271_9270fc0f99_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Bridge" /></a></p>

<p>Easier trails follow. Even the sun comes through more often. Up another hill, and more wide views.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9763850285/" title="Sun &amp; Clouds"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7335/9763850285_bbb51e324f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Sun &amp; Clouds" /></a></p>

<p>Another night in a hut. The morning brings rain, and a German-Finnish doctor on his way back to civilization. We chat for a long time, waiting for the rain to stop. With hardshells on, we leave, but soon enough the sun comes through and we switch back to windjackets.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9763991044/" title="That way"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2809/9763991044_e50a703e0b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="That way" /></a>

<p>Paradise Gorge is beautiful indeed, and a nice scramble up. I pitch the TrailStar for a tea break, before we head to the second highest summit. A rainbow hangs in the sky to the left as we descend to the Devil’s Gorge, and on the way to the break hut a short rain shower sees us putting the hardshells on again.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9764143326/" title="Up Paradise Gorge"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3770/9764143326_5c798e849b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Up Paradise Gorge" /></a>

<p>As we arrive at Muorravaarakka hut the sun shines down from a blue sky again. A Dutch family tells us that we <em>just missed the rain</em> and then set off to Anterinmukka hut. We pack the hardshells away for the 2nd time today, eat, refill our bottles and then set off again. Twenty-five minutes later we catch up with the family, who have a coffee break at the top of the hill, enjoying the view. “See you at the hut. We’ll keep the Sauna warm for you!” we tell them.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9764301996/" title="Devil's Gorge"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2828/9764301996_cbb1cfb5a8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Devil's Gorge" /></a></p>

<p>The sauna is still warm, so we pitch the shelters, grab the whiskey, kuksas and towels and head in. The river water is cold, refreshing. As we go back up, the Dutch family has just arrived, and they happily head to the warm sauna.</p>

<p>We sleep under Silnylon and Cuben, cocooned into our warm quilts and sleeping bags. The next morning brings a grey sky yet again, but it looks like it will stay dry and get sunny. Coffee and müsli is our fuel, we pack and leave on a Quad trail onwards, following the river up in which we swam last night.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9764208401/" title="Fireplace"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7316/9764208401_fe3dd21a8b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Fireplace" /></a></p>

<p>At a lone fireplace we again leave the trail behind, following another river until we reach its origin, where it splits: One part goes east, the other west. We head north, across extensive boulder fields, through a lost valley of Eden, and up even more boulder fields. Sokosti, Eastern Finland’s highest summit, is our goal, but it’s ugly: A radio tower, two support huts and an array of solar panels crown it, but no rest place for hikers.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9769576353/" title="Towards Sokosti"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7429/9769576353_1cdd00a4b0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Towards Sokosti" /></a></p>

<p>The descent is an exercise in finding the path. We give up, make our own, and before we reach the tree line sit down for the last tortilla and cheese lunch. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9764088782/" title="There's the Sauna?"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2836/9764088782_aa74826384_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="There's the Sauna?" /></a></p>

<p>At Luirojärvi another Sauna waits, and images worth of postcards. We enjoy the warmth of the sauna, the coldness of the lake, before we head on to pitch the TrailStar, make a fire, boil the chantarelles I found earlier in the morning, and enjoy this fine, starry evening.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9769497594/" title="Mirror Image II"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3665/9769497594_ee42f5826b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Mirror Image II" /></a></p>

<p>The morning brings fog and sunshine. It’s a spectacle worth seeing every time, and under a blue bird sky we pack and start the longest stretch of the journey. Hills covered in red, orange and yellow, wide moors and Rock Ptarmigans accompany us. It is so warm, we hike in T-Shirts, and I enjoy the opportunities to wade through cold rivers.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9769573263/" title="Mirror image by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5447/9769573263_d2796379b3_b.jpg" width="680" height="1024" alt="Mirror image" /></a>

<p>Kilometers fly by, and we encounter more and more people heading in the opposite direction. Heavy-loaded external frame backpacks are still the norm, as are complaints by their bearers about aching knees and blisters. We load up on water, leave the gathering at the laavu behind and head up.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9769707276/" title="Hyperlite Mountain Gear UltaMid"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7412/9769707276_aeb0f94db0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Hyperlite Mountain Gear UltaMid" /></a></p>

<p>The sun sets, but the blood red sky at the horizon lingers on for what seems like forever, until darkness from the east consumes it and shrouds the sky into its black cloak with blinking white stars. No Northern Lights, though, no matter how long I sit outside watching the sky.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9769778313/" title="X"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3748/9769778313_e05e51f5af_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="X" /></a></p>

<p>Mist is moving across distant mountain tops in the morning, while the sun tries hard to break through the clouds. As it finally does, we start to walk. By the time we reach the Station at Kilopää we already have encountered more than two dozen hikers and backpackers. Yes, the wilderness definitely lays now behind us, and civilization has us back again.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9769750802/" title="Grey, yellow, blue"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7328/9769750802_cbfe175257_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Grey, yellow, blue" /></a></p>

<h3 id="practicalities">Practicalities</h3>

<p>Flying is the fastest and often also the cheapest choice. There’s connections from Helsinki to Ivalo, and from Ivalo airport you take the bus south to Saariselkä, Kilopää or Koilliskaira.</p>

<p>More environmentally friendly and a lot more time consuming is the train + bus combo. Head on the night train to Rovaniemi, get a cabin, sleep, then hop in the morning on the bus to Saariselkä, Kilopää or Koilliskaira to start your adventure.</p>

<p>Saariselkä has an <a href="http://www.partioaitta.fi/saariselka">Partioaitta</a> outdoor shop where you can get gas canisters and gear. The village also has a few supermarkets which will let you shop for food. If you have spare time in Rovaniemi, head to the <a href="http://www.prisma.fi/market/prisma?a_Visit:rajaa=1&amp;osuuskauppa=ARINA&amp;pageName=Main&amp;b_haku.paikka=Rovaniemi">Prisma</a> there for a very wide variety of outdoor gear and food at more reasonable prices.</p>

<p>The National Park is divided into four zones with different regulations in terms of wild camping. Outside of the Basic Zone trails are not marked, and you should know how a compass works, best in conjunction with a map. Speaking off, the Koilliskairan ulkoilukartta map is the best map if you want to explore the wild side of the National Park. Sadly it’s just a crappy paper map and will fall apart after a week of use.</p>

<p>There’s six Saunas in the National Park, plenty of huts, both free (<em>Autiotupa</em>) and reservable (<em>Varaustupa</em>), as well as two dozen laavus and several turf huts. The price of a reservable hut is 10 euro/ night/ bed and all beds will be sold if there’s demand. Daytrip huts are not for overnight stays, and if you go to the dry toilet throw some of the wood stuff from the box over your business. You can drink water everywhere, though if you have a sensitive stomach boil it first.</p>

    <id>http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/07/southern-finland-bouldering-guide</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Finland not only has superb hiking, backpacking and paddling to offer, thanks to the ice age, which stopped here 10.000 years ago, the country also has plenty of superb boulders for climbing - many of them in Southern Finland. If you visit Helsinki for business or pleasure, make sure to take along your climbing shoes and a copy of the Southern Finland Bouldering Guide to check out the local rocks!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9127157903/" title="Southern Finland Bouldering Guide by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3718/9127157903_1e45a24e1b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Southern Finland Bouldering Guide" /></a></p>

<p>The Southern Finland Bouldering Guide came out earlier this year, and is a completely self-published book. As I know how much work goes into making a book, it is great to see that the three authors have produced such a high-quality book which certainly will set standards for bouldering guides in Finland. Alone that it is bilingual - Finnish and English - is a superb accomplishment which needs to be applauded! <a href="http://media.boulderkeskus.com/media/pdf/bouldertopo_demo.pdf">Take a look in the book here</a> and see for yourself how well made it is!</p>

<p>The book starts off with a brief introduction, followed by the Everymen’s Right and a <em>How to use this book</em> page and an explanation of the icons et al. If you’re new to bouldering outdoors, a <em>Falling for dummies</em> page tells you about spotting. After that it already jumps in and gives you a bit more background on bouldering in Helsinki and the area within Kehä III. There’s some fantastic spots here, with problems ranging from 4s to 8B+ - so really something for any skill level.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9129396210/" title="Southern Finland Bouldering Guide Overview by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5448/9129396210_e67c847fc5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Southern Finland Bouldering Guide Overview" /></a></p>

<p>Sectors start with a short overview, telling about the location and how to get there. At least in Helsinki you can get to most spots via public transportation, which is great news for those who visit the city on holidays. A good map helps you find the boulders then, and often also includes bus stops and other information which are useful. </p>

<p>Then the book jumps in and shows the different boulders, with the problems as lines on them - just like you might know it from <a href="http://27crags.com/">27crags.com</a> - which, btw, the books recommends for updated and new problems, too. The photos are good, though some really stand out as superb and get you very excited about the rocks. There’s no or little beta, so you can Flash the problems, too!</p>

<p>Besides Helsinki and the Metropolitan area you will also find chapters on Hämeenlinna, “the Rest of Southern Finland” and Åland, which is widely considered one of the most beautiful and best boulder destinations. Looking at the photos and problems of the latter, I definitely see why!</p>

<p><strong>Bottomline:</strong> An excellent bouldering guide, jam-packed with exciting problems to add to you tick list. If you’re only faintly interested in bouldering in Finland, get this book. It will help you plan your boulder holidays in Finland, or lets you find problems in your neck of the city for a little evening entertainment. Whenever I head south, this book, my <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/scarpa-feroce-climbing-shoe-parrot.html">climbing shoes</a>, <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/arcteryx-c40-chalkbag-bf/">chalk bag</a> and possibly my <a href="http://www.unterwegs.biz/paddy-dominator-496254.html">crashpad</a> come along, so that I can combine business &amp; pleasure!</p>
