    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ski-touring without certain items just isn’t smart. So you’re not going out into the mountains without the right kit, here’s a look at what you should have along when you skin up the next mountain to enjoy some sweet pow!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25686718380/in/album-72157665020355632/" title="Will and Anselm discussing our run"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/2/1690/25686718380_3134f5b330_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Will and Anselm discussing our run" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>No one likes to think about avalanches when he goes out into the backcountry, but it is a danger that is always present when we go off-piste, searching for deep powder fields and steep runs. As I set out ski-touring last winter my first thoughts went straight to safety - maybe because as a dad of two kids coming home healthy and in one piece is very important to me. Even if you’re not a mom or dad I imagine you too want to come safely home from a ski-touring trip, and hence the topic of safety is something we need to talk about. </p>

<p>But before I delve into the gear which you should wear and carry the most important part is to apply ones common sense, aka the grey squishy bit between your ears. We all probably feel like we have to little time out in the mountains, so when the avalanche danger is high while we have that short ski vacation we might be tempted to forgo the warnings and still go up the mountain. Well, just don’t - or go somewhere where it is safe. </p>

<p>Avalanche safety really starts before you start out on the hills, so make sure check avalanche bulletin of your region and talk with local(s) (mountain guides &amp; ski teachers, for example). That you should know how to use your gear - from beacon to probe &amp; proper shovelling - goes without saying really, and if you’re new to the game do yourself a favour and visit a avalanche course or two before you head out into the hills. Then when the warning is low and the slopes are calling, it is safe to go and find that deep pow stash! </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/31084355955/in/dateposted/" title="My Avalanche safety kit"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/6/5649/31084355955_5ab3f5b2ce_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="My Avalanche safety kit" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>So what’s the safety gear I wear &amp; carry when I head out to the mountains? Around my body I wear the <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/pieps-dsp-pro-ice-beacon/?pid=10239">PIEPS DSP Pro Ice</a> Avalanche Beacon. This beacon packs a lot of functions - the most important ones for me are the large 60 m search radius, because this would allow me in case of a burial to detect a mate already from further away; and the three antennas allow for a precise localization of the signal, minimizing the time you spent probing the snow. The Mark function lets me mark mates in case of multiple burials, and as it can be very bright &amp; white in the mountains it is very useful that the display is easy to read in any light &amp; shows the direction plus distance of the burial clearly. </p>

<p>The DSP Pro Ice is also dead easy to use and the 400 hour battery life means I can go out a season long and don’t need to switch batteries. It performs a self-check at start-up and lets you know when it is OK, has 5 years of warranty and also come with the carry system you see in the photo. There’s a lot of tech in this beacon but the size and weight are still pretty good. However, if I would be in the market again I’d be tempted to pick up the <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/pieps-micro-beacon/?pid=10239">PIEPS Micro Beacon</a> because not only is it cheaper than the DSP Pro Ice, it is also lighter and smaller! But at 198 g the PIEPS DSP Pro Ice isn’t really too heavy, and I rarely realize I am wearing it when I skin up or ski down a mountain. I switch it on when I start my ascent, and switch it off when back down. All in all I am very happy with this beacon and can recommend it if you’re looking for the best beacon with the most features on the market. </p>

<p>I’m using a <a href="http://bit.ly/2f6XBPH">G3 SpadeTECH Shovel</a> and a <a href="http://bit.ly/2fLL8m3">G3 240 Speed TECH Probe</a> because I got them for free when I <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/09/arcteryx-workshop-tour.html">visited Arc’teryx in Vancouver</a> last year. They are light and compact, deploy fast when needed and the shovel is easy to use, also with thick gloves on. The 240 cm probe is on the shorter side, but thus far (in practices) I have never needed a longer probe. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/30941962332/in/dateposted/" title="G3 SpadeTECH Shovel"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/6/5703/30941962332_364908af1d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="G3 SpadeTECH Shovel" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/30941957112/in/dateposted/" title="G3 240 Speed TECH Probe Details"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/6/5752/30941957112_e84f4160c1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="G3 240 Speed TECH Probe Details" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I’m always carrying a small FA Kit - sometimes the <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/ortovox-first-aid-light-first-aid-kit/?pid=10239">ORTOVOX First Aid Light</a> but usually just a super-small MYOG kit (couple of Compeeds, an emergency bivy/ blanket and a few pain killers). These commercial kits are alright but I find the are over-specced and one doesn’t need that much gear when outside, and they’re also pretty big - when I’m out ski-touring I only have a 25l pack and space comes at a premium. If you have a bigger pack you might not have this problem &amp; can carry a large FA kit, but if you’re experienced &amp; know what you might need take a smaller &amp; lighter kit, suitable to your needs.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/30941960662/in/dateposted/" title="Ortovox First Aid Light Kit"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/6/5479/30941960662_ed039fde7a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Ortovox First Aid Light Kit" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>All of that I carry in my <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/black-diamond-dawn-patrol-25-ski-touring-backpack/?pid=10239">Black Diamond Dawn Patrol 25</a> which also has the extra <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/black-diamond-avalung-element-breathing-system/?pid=10239">Avalung Breathing System</a>. The Dawn Patrol 25 pack has a front avy tool pocket which means I can access my shovel and probe super-fast when needed and I don’t need to first dig through my pack to find shovel &amp; probe, which is very important in an emergency situation. I actually was able to fit crampons, extra clothes, a thermos and water as well as skins and snacks into this pack when I was doing the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/03/teaser-graubunden-haute-route.html">Graubünden Haute-Route</a>! </p>

<p>That’s it! With this gear I can tour safely in the mountains, know I can help a friend if he would get buried and have a fair chance at also surviving an avalanche. But remember: The most important bit is to not go into avalanche terrain, know your limits and practice your skills so that you can come home again! Stay safe in the mountains and enjoy the summits &amp; powder!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Winter is coming</em>. And that means I’ll again step into the bindings of my DPS Wailer Tour1 Skis, skin up a fine mountain, put down my heel and flow through the pow!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26148754403/in/album-72157665452784994/" title="At the summit"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/2/1681/26148754403_5dff0ce1e6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="At the summit" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Picking my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/gear-of-the-year/">Gear of the Year</a> isn’t easy: There’s a lot of equipment that comes over my table (happily a lot <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/01/zero-gear-year.html">less this year</a>) and while that alone isn’t what makes it hard, it’s those favourites which I have used for many years which make it difficult, as these favourites are always strong contenders for my Gear of the Year Award. But while I really love my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/luna-sandals-oso.html">Luna Sandals</a> it is my <a href="http://www.dpsskis.com/en/skis/browse-skis-by-shape/all-mountain-mixed-snow/wailer-430.html">DPS Wailer Tour1 Skis</a> which I chose this year, because of two reasons: 1. They allow me to be more in the mountains and 2. They’re some of the lightest ski-touring skis on the market. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25738443973/in/album-72157664672954972/" title="Tools of joy!"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/2/1598/25738443973_d7b1af966a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Tools of joy!" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>These skis (as well as the <a href="https://www.bergzeit.de/g3-ion-12-tourenbindung-16-17/?pid=81">bindings</a>, <a href="https://www.bergzeit.de/contour-hybrid-free-split-skins-skifell-s/?pid=81">skins</a> and <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/04/la-sportiva-spectre.html">boots</a>) have accompanied me to Canada, South Tyrol, Austria, Finnish Lapland, Switzerland and <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/05/lyngen.html">Norway</a> and I have stood almost 30 days on them. Thirty days in the wintery mountains, that’s pretty sweet in my book. Simply because in my book a day spent in the mountains is a day well spent. And if I can be active, skin up a mountain with good friends, smile together at the summit and then put down my heel to carve a fine line into the fresh powder, well, I can imagine few things which would be better in winter &amp; which make me so happy.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25105375706/in/album-72157664672954972/" title="I like crust, but I only like it on Crème brûlée"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/2/1676/25105375706_0f539523c5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="I like crust, but I only like it on Crème brûlée" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I was skiing with my brother in South Tyrol and we went on a ski-tour while it was dumping snow. We were the only ones out that day, and as we reached that cabin down there, sat down in it and drunk some hot tea, we didn’t care that the summit would be some other 20 minutes of skining further up the mountain. We sat there, sweaty, smiling, munching a chocolate bar, and looking forward to ski down through that fresh powder. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24460363514/in/album-72157664166747400/" title="I love me a nice cabin!"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/2/1466/24460363514_7edaab5590_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="I love me a nice cabin!" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I Switzerland Anselm, Willi and me wanted to complete the <a href="http://www.hauteroute-graubuenden.ch">Graubünden Haute Route</a> but conditions conspired against us. While this winter wasn’t particularly good the week we were in Switzerland the Avalanche Danger was so high that we weren’t able to do the complete Haute Route. That didn’t hinder us from having a grand time in the Swiss Mountains, staying with some fantastic hut wardens, skiing some great lines and feeling happy while standing on our skis. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26436513541/in/album-72157665020355632/" title="Boot-packing up"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/2/1490/26436513541_8e1264ac4b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Boot-packing up" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The <a href="http://bit.ly/2eUHSEx">DPS Wailer Tour1 Skis</a> are award winning skis which are Made in Utah, USA. They’re ultralight at 1.410 g per ski and 184 cm length, which is great when you’re having days with lots of ascent - the low weight is very energy saving. You’ll float through powder with a smile on your face and will be happy on spring crust - through stay off-piste as that’s the one thing they don’t really like (and weren’t made for). But powder, well, you’ll surf through it, make ace turns and throw up some cold smoke that you wish will never end. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25816133670/in/album-72157665518007630/" title="Backcountry fun on Jyppyrä, Hetta Hiihtomaa"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/2/1675/25816133670_564e5094cc_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Backcountry fun on Jyppyrä, Hetta Hiihtomaa" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>So, that possibility - to surf through a meter of fresh snow and then skin back up to take a 2nd run - that’s why I love my <strong>DPS Wailer Tour1 Skis</strong> and that’s why they are my <strong>Gear of the Year</strong>. I’m sure they will allow me to collect a lot more of fine winter mountain skiing memories, and for that I am grateful. </p>

<p>If you want to experience the mountains in winter and float through the powder, buy a pair at <a href="http://bit.ly/2fnPt2K">evo</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/2eUHSEx">Backcountry.com</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/2f645Qd">REI</a> or <a href="https://www.bergzeit.de/dps-wailer-106-tour1-tourenski-16-17-168cm/?pid=81">Bergzeit</a>.</p>

<p>Together with Henryk from <a href="http://www.oooyeah.de">Out of Office</a> I spent a fantastic week in the Lyngen Alps. Here’s a wee teaser so you can book your flight tickets and accommodation there for next spring, because it most certainly is a place you want to be. It all starts in Tromsø, where already the approach by plane is breath-taking. Then you go for a walk in the old town and pick up your Van from <a href="http://www.takemeaway.no">Take me Away Camping</a> to head north-west to the Lyngen Alps and their surroundings.</p>

<p>You probably want to stop to take in the view once in a while.</p>

<p>When your bindings decides to break you go for a walk along the coast of Arnøya and make a stop in a lovely little cabin.</p>

<p>And what’s wrong with sitting down in the sun and have a beer (after a day of skiing, obviously!)?</p>

<p>On the summit you snap a selfie with that big grin because the view is so amazing.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In late February and early March I made a visit to Switzerland to attempt the Graubünden Haute Route. Sadly the high avalanche danger and changing weather cut us short - here’s a first taste of four days ski-touring in Graubünden.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25455047716/in/album-72157665020355632/" title="Going down."><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1445/25455047716_5a5b16aa20_b.jpg" width="1024" height="684" alt="Going down." /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.hauteroute-graubuenden.ch">Graubünden Haute Route</a> is a five days/ four nights ski-touring trip where you visit four beautiful huts, ski great powder, test your mountaineering skills while climbing some beautiful peaks and enjoy great scenary. Well, that’s at least the normal plan, but because of not really good weather and high avalanche danger our trip was cut a wee bit short. Stay tuned for a full day-to-day account of my Haute Route experience, but for now enjoy these fine selection of photos! </p>

<p>Day one we skied from Madulain to the D’Es-Cha Hut, where we spent in the end two nights because we didn’t want to risk our lives in highly dangerous avalanche terrain. It’s a beautiful hut with great wardens, a wide selection of board and card games as well as interesting magazines - so we didn’t get bored while waiting for better weather.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The second big news from last weeks <a href="http://arcteryx.com">Arc’teryx</a> media event in Vancouver was the launch of the Voltair Avalanche Airbag. As I was able to use and deploy it over three days in the Canadian backcountry what follows are more insights on this game-changing avalanche airbag.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/23716165196/in/dateposted/" title="Arc’teryx Designer Gord Rose skiing with his creation, the Voltair Avalanche Airbag"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5734/23716165196_6633e02f0d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Arc’teryx Designer Gord Rose skiing with his creation, the Voltair Avalanche Airbag" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="the-tech">The Tech</h2>

<p>No, it has no similarities with the JetForce Technology. Both are powered by a battery, but that’s already what these two technologies have in common. And the Arc’teryx Voltair Avalanche Airbag battery allows the bag to be deployed up to 8 times on a fully charged battery, which is two times as often as the Jetforce lets you deploy the ballon. It’s even more at warmer temperatures, and less at -30°C - but then again, not many will be out skiing at -30°C. </p>

<p>Gordon Rose started to dabble in Avalanche packs around ten years ago, but the Voltair project started in February 2010 for real. Since then Gordon and his colleague Peter Hill, who is responsible for the backpack part of the Voltair, have been working on this avalanche pack. The inspiration for Gordon came from RC Models - he and a colleague where talking about how fast model planes can go, the short comings of compressed gas airbag, and saw possibilities of RC Technology for avalanche bags. Gordon went through many tests of propellor and centrifugal blowers until he settled on a mixed flow centrifugal blower. Advanced Design Technology in London, UK, helped him and Arc’teryx design the optimal propellor and after 21 designs and tests they had the perfect one for their pack. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/23447243040/in/dateposted/" title="Gordon Rose with the tech guts of the Voltair Avalanche Airbag"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5798/23447243040_c612e0e1b1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Gordon Rose with the tech guts of the Voltair Avalanche Airbag" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The next step was to get the battery right. Gordon settled on a Lithium Polymer battery design as these work well at cold temperatures and are the most efficient. Powertraveller helped design and manufacture the battery, and the one in the Voltair now allows you to deploy the ballon up to 8 times at -15°C - more at warmer temperatures, less at -30°C. The benefit of this should be obvious: It allows you to practice to deploy the airbag. If you know how it behaves, you’re less likely to hesitate to pull the trigger and deploy the ballon. Each of us popped the ballon a couple of times in a test environment, and then up in the mountains again. In the case of an avalanche this means you don’t wait and pull the trigger and deploy the ballon. The battery is charged via a cable and goes from empty to full in 2,5 hours, and weighs 800 g - a weight that Arc’teryx hopes to improve in the future. </p>

<p>For the release trigger Arc’teryx decided to use a mechanical system - while the possibility to use an electronic system is tempting, they decided in harsh conditions there’s just too much which can go wrong with a electronic release, and a reliable pull trigger is the best way to go. The Trigger is easy to unlock, but even in a locked position it is easy to release the ballon with just a small twist. The trigger is custom-molded and easy to grip with mitts and gloves, and connects via a steel cable to the ballon compartment. A pull on the trigger pops the closure open, this in turn connects to an electronic trigger which starts up the centrifugal blower which inflates the ballon in less than five seconds.</p>

<p>The next design hurdle was the Brushless DC Motor, which are difficult to make reliable at cold weather. After tracking down many designers across the globe Gord found the right guy just five minutes from the Arc’teryx Design HQ, and he helped him design a reliable engine which also performs at -30°C. 90% of the other technology in the pack is also custom-made, from flexible wires to the circuit board and release notch, Arc’teryx spent nearly six years to make this backpack the best in its category. To learn more, please watch this exclusive video where Gordon Rose and Peter Hill talk about the Voltair Avalanche Airbag:</p>

<p>(<em>Interview video coming soon!</em>)</p>

<h2 id="the-pack">The Pack</h2>

<p>The goal of Peter Hill was to make a classic, timeless Arc’teryx backpack which still looks great in five years. Constructed from the AC² material with taped seams and glued-in Sidewinder zippers, the pack is waterproof and keeps your gear dry. As it rained &amp; snowed all the time as we were up in the mountains it was a good test for the pack, and it performed great: Everything stayed dry inside. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/23633782422/in/album-72157662401963745/" title="Arc’teryx Voltair Avalanche Airbag - Side"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5797/23633782422_324efe2db1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Arc’teryx Voltair Avalanche Airbag - Side" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Voltair has three compartments: A ballon compartment, an avalanche Kit compartment and a main compartment. Available in two sizes these pack are real 20 l and 30 l packs, unlike some packs of competitors which barely let you pack a puffy jacket and thermos bottle in their claimed volumes. I carried in my 30 l test pack two extra pairs of gloves, my <a href="http://bit.ly/1P2NxEx">Arc’teryx Cerium SV Jacket</a>, my <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/norroena-lyngen-alpha100-vest-kunstfaserweste/?pid=10239">Norrona Lyngen Alpha100 Vest</a>, a water bottle, sandwiches and snacks, my <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/contour-hybrid-mix-130-skifelle/?pid=10239">countour Hybrid skins</a>, a tripod, two cameras and I had plenty of room to spare. If I compare that to my <a href="https://www.bergzeit.co.uk/black-diamond-dawn-patrol-25-ski-rucksack-deep-torch-black-m-l/?pid=81">Black Diamond Dawn Patrol 25 pack</a> that’s a massive difference, where it gets pretty hard to get so much gear in. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/23716247456/in/album-72157662401963745/" title="Avalanche Kit Pocket"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/738/23716247456_a1a40505f3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Avalanche Kit Pocket" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The carrying system of the Voltair is very comfortable and is fully adjustable. The hipbelt has some freedom of movement so you can turn those hips for your turns, and if you want to save weight you can remove the stays. The hipbelt also can be turned around for transport, and the chest strap can be removed if you feel you don’t need it. The leg loop strap is very easy to use which is very important: It’s the piece of gear that ensures you stay connected to the backpack and ballon if you get into an avalanche. It is super easy to clip in and out - also with mitts on - and the design is inspired by ice clippers as you might know them from ice climbing. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/23742317785/in/album-72157662401963745/" title="Leg loop clip-in point"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5829/23742317785_aa47814a51_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Leg loop clip-in point" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The pack isn’t ultralight, even if Arc’teryx tried to use the lightest &amp; most durable materials and technology in the pack. The 20 l pack is 3.235 g and the 30 l pack is 3.465 g - the tech inside is a big part of that, with the battery itself already being a wee bit over 800 g. Arc’teryx hopes that this weight will be decreased in the not-too-distant future, especially since major players are heavily infesting into energy storage solutions.</p>

<h2 id="in-use">In Use</h2>

<p>I was able to use the pack for three days out at <a href="http://www.callaghancountry.com">Callaghan Country</a>, which gave me a good understanding how this pack carries and deploys. The first thing you realize is the comfortable carrying system, which carries also (for an ultralight backpacker) very well, even with a pretty full pack. Also the leg loop is wonderfully intuitive and unobtrusive: It clips in and out super easy even with thick gloves on, and you don’t realize it is there while skinning and skiing. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/23633780212/in/album-72157662401963745/" title="Arc’teryx Voltair Avalanche Airbag at Callaghan Country"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5702/23633780212_2243ce5e36_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Arc’teryx Voltair Avalanche Airbag at Callaghan Country" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>As I haven’t used Avalanche Airbags before I have nothing to compare the Voltair to, but chatting with Lou of <a href="http://wildsnow.com">Wildsnow</a> and my other colleagues at the event it became evident that the Voltair is a well-designed Avalanche backpack which compares very good with other packs in the market. The advantages of battery-powered packs in comparison to compressed air backpacks are evident: You can practice and test the release of the ballon at home, it is much easier to travel with as you don’t need to find a place to fill up the air cartridge before you hit the slopes at your destination, and being able to release the ballon in the Voltair up to eight times means using this pack on long outings adds a lot of safety. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/23659988171/in/album-72157662401963745/" title="Packing the Ballon 1"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5703/23659988171_0fef0d05d5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Packing the Ballon 1" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Packing the ballon is a thing of two to five minutes, depending on your level of practice. The ballon deflates via a valve which you slide in. Happily the ballon does not need to be folded in a special way - just stuff it back into the ballon compartment, close the zipper, pop the hatch back in and you’re ready. I discussed at length with Peter and Gordon about the use of zippers for the ballon compartment as it’s most certainly the thing I like least, but as every other avalanche pack on the market uses zippers (they work!) and in a pinch you can use the ballon even if the zipper is broken, I am convinced that it is OK. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/23115555973/in/album-72157662401963745/" title="Ballon compartment"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/579/23115555973_03b5921fd9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Ballon compartment" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Putting the system on and releasing the ballon is also easy. You put the battery on and get a re-assuring short whirr which means the system is on and ready to go. The green LED lamp at the outside will blink green indicating that all is good to go, then you just turn the handle to the green dot side and you’re ready to skin up and ski down. In the case of an avalanche you pull the trigger and <em>POP!</em> the ballon deploys, helping you to hopefully stay on top thanks to the inverse segregation principle, which sorts larger particles to the top of the avalanche. The handle of the Voltair is also always accessible and can not be stowed away, this again minimizes the risk of user error and is different from other avalanche packs.</p>

<p>You can carry skis/ snowboard and an ice axe at the front of the pack, just make sure to put the ice axe with the tip down (ballons and steel tips don’t work well together). The side compression straps help to minimize volume if you are out with a small load, and the front hipbelt is comfortable and carries well. All buckles are easy to open in cold weather with gloves, and the zippers have tabs which makes them easy to operate with gloves on.</p>

<p>Finally, the battery and control unit of the circuit collect data of the pack in use, with the aim to further the knowledge base of avalanche airbags in use. This data can be downloaded - should the user agree - when the pack is sent in for inspection. Arc’teryx works close together with Pascal Haegeli of the Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, one of the premier avalanche researchers on the planet. </p>

<h2 id="the-bottomline">The Bottomline</h2>

<p>The Voltair is a beautifully designed avalanche pack which is spacious and easy to use. The tech inside is all custom-made and designed to the highest standards, so that it can operate at -30°C and for many years in the harsh conditions of the backcountry. It is easy to learn how to deploy the ballon, pack it back in and then carry all your gear on your backcountry ski-tours. Fully waterproof it keeps your kit inside dry, and the possibilities for human error minimized it hopefully helps you to survive an avalanche if you should ever get into one. The packs will retail for 1650€ for the 30 l pack and 1550€ for the 20 l and will be available in autumn 2016. <em>Of course using the pack for just three days is not enough for a long-term review, but I am confident that with a sample pack showing up hopefully soon I can put it through its paces during the many ski-touring trips I have planned for this winter and then can get a more detailed review up by spring.</em></p>
