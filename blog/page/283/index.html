  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
I do read a lot, and not only online. I really enjoy reading a book over breakfast or the afternoon coffee, and also when I go hiking it can be great to have a book with you for those long evenings at the campfire in winter. In this series I will introduce you to some books which I have read and found useful, so if you&#8217;re a book rat like me, read on!<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FwA5kvfqTnaOJelGO2fo4A?authkey=Gv1sRgCL3Eut7PmfvnMQ&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S4aF2RDaskI/AAAAAAAABuM/QpSrCOIW2IE/s800/IMG_6039.JPG" /></a><br />Part of my collection of backpacking, bushcraft and outdoor related books.<br /><br />The first book I&#8217;d like to introduce you to is <a href="http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/3866862857?ie=UTF8&tag=hikiinfinl-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1638&creative=6742&creativeASIN=3866862857">Trekking Ultraleicht</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.de/e/ir?t=hikiinfinl-21&l=as2&o=3&a=3866862857" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> from Stefan Dapprich. I won this book in a raffle, and its in German. Its weight of 129 g and the small size mean that it fits easily into my backpack for a trip, in case I want to brush up on something or just read it again.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/XFOkrBY8ApGqCg86MpahHA?authkey=Gv1sRgCL3Eut7PmfvnMQ&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S4aF3n_STxI/AAAAAAAABuQ/gD1-XD9lZA0/s800/IMG_6044.JPG" /></a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/3866862857?ie=UTF8&tag=hikiinfinl-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1638&creative=6742&creativeASIN=3866862857">Trekking Ultraleicht by Stefan Dapprich</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.de/e/ir?t=hikiinfinl-21&l=as2&o=3&a=3866862857" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /><br /><br />The book is clearly aimed at people who are new to ultralight backpacking, and it is a good introduction to the philosophy of UL backpacking, with tips on gear and useful skills to know. The gear recommendations in the book are a bit outdated and odd in my opinion, but that is for a print medium negligible I think - especially since the book is connected to the German <a href="http://trekking-ultraleicht.de/">trekking-ultraleicht.de</a> forum where readers can discuss their questions and get more up-to-date suggestions on gear. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/3866862857?ie=UTF8&tag=hikiinfinl-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1638&creative=6742&creativeASIN=3866862857">Trekking Ultraleicht</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.de/e/ir?t=hikiinfinl-21&l=as2&o=3&a=3866862857" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> goes over the big three, kitchen, water, food, clothing and various other items, and has MYOG plans in it as well. A definite highlight of the book is the food section, and the author&#8217;s recipe for pemmican is absolutely delicious, as I was able to taste for myself on the last tour. I will attempt to make some of this myself for future trips, and shall share my recipe in a how-to post.<br /><br />The author writes in an easy to understand way, and one clearly sees that he know what he writes about. He has been UL on tour in various different parts of the world, from the Australian Outback to Greenland, and thus his recommendations are based on his own experience and not only (internet) research. I really like that he recommends a lot of basic household items, for example Ziploc bags and small containers for the storage of food and other items which need to stay dry - this not only saves money, but is often overlooked in favour of more expensive drysacks and whatnot.<br /><br />To conclude, the 140 pages of content are a excellent first step for anyone interested in ultralight backpacking, with useful tips for how to make the change from heavy to light, plenty of photos, pack lists for summer and autumn/ spring trips and a good overview of UL gear choices - maybe slightly outdated by now, but on the other hand some of them are already classics. I believe that spending the 9,90€ for the book helps to save money in the long term, because you will know what to look for and don&#8217;t need to spend money on a variety of other gear that you might not need.<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Disclosure: I have an Amazon Affiliate account, and if you click on the link and buy the book I even might earn a few euros - for more books!</span></div>

A while ago I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.lightheartgear.com/">LightHeart Gear</a> who makes a very innovative shelter. I contacted Judy, the woman behind the cottage, and she agreed to take part in the interview. It is the first woman who run&#8217;s a UL cottage, so read on to find out how Judy came up with the concept for the tent and where LightHeart Gear is headed!<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/tzPM9axY157Y7FTEA1ce6A?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S4Itrt3rSXI/AAAAAAAABtk/hzs3vyUtjVU/s800/H7.jpg" /></a><br />Judy entering the Great Smoky Mountain National park, in 2006 - and still carrying that 4 1/2 lb tent!<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Judy, please briefly introduce yourself and tell us who you are. Since when are you backpacking, and how did you start? How often are you out backpacking nowadays?</span><br /> <br />Hi, my name is Judy Gross, I grew up in New York City, and did not do any outdoors stuff as a kid. The past 20+ years I have lived in Houston Texas where I raised my twin boys. My sons were in Boy Scouts and I went on a lot of camping and backpack trips with them. In 1999, when they were 14 years old, we drove from Texas to the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. That’s where I first saw the sign for the Appalachian Trail. That’s when the trail started calling my name, telling me to “walk”. In 2006, having never done any thing more than one or two nights out, I set out to Thru Hike the AT. I sustained a shoulder injury in a fall that took me off the trail at about 900 miles. The following year, I went back and did a further 600 miles. I had hoped to go back and start a new Thru hike this year (2010) but my new tent business needs me more. I am planning to hike the John Muir trail this summer though. Two years ago I moved from Houston, Texas to Asheville, North Carolina when my husband retired, so most of my hiking right now is day hikes in the Great Smoky Mountain National Park, where I am working on hiking all the 800 miles of trails in the park.<br /> <br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Are you a lightweight/ UL backpacker? If so, what is your typical baseweight?</span><br /> <br />I am not an ultra light backpacker, and never will be, I strive to find the right balance between comfort on the trail and comfort in camp. Some things I’m just not willing to give up (like my tent). When I started the AT in 2006 my pack weight was 37 pounds (with 2 lt of water and 4 days of food). I think if I went back today it would be under 30 pounds.<br /> <br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">What is your own favorite backpack, sleep system and shelter? Any other favourite piece of gear which you always carry with you?</span><br /> <br />I use a Granite Gear Nimbus Ozone pack, it weighs 3 pounds, but for me it is so comfortable that I don’t notice the weight, I have tried lighter packs, they just don’t carry as well for me. My sleeping bag is a Mountain Hardware 15° or 40° down bag, and my tent is of course is a LightHeart Solo tent. The fun part of the tent is I can take a different colored one each time I go out! Another item I just like for it’s convenience and not for it’s weight is the Jet Boil stove.<br /> <br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">LightHeart Gear makes a very innovative tent, and currently it&#8217;s as a Solo version available with a Duo option coming in April. Can you tell us a bit how you conceived the design, where the inspiration came from and how you decided to start the company? </span><br /> <br />Where do I start?  I spent 30+ years working as a nurse in emergency rooms, and when I finally retired from that career I decided to pursue my interest and love of sewing and design. I started a small alterations business, and thought I would like to open a sewing school. During my thru hike attempt in 2006, I got really angry about the 4 ½ lb tent I was carrying. So much weight! I went home and bought a (used) single person tarp tent, but I felt very claustrophobic in it. This set me on the road to “Do Better!” My goals for a tent were; Room – I want to be able to sit up, turn around, get dressed in the tent. Simplicity of design, ease of set up, and of course light weight. I wanted my trekking poles to be the tent supports, but I wanted them tucked out of the way where they couldn’t get knocked over. I looked at many of the tents on the market to get some design ideas, and after several attempts and re-design I came up with the version of the tent now on the market.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/NZx1KODQ1WTFGwsrLjyBtA?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S4ItpSjxuKI/AAAAAAAABtU/1YNIYnCZSGw/s800/H1.jpg" /></a><br />Judy cutting out a new green tent. <br /><br />My husband and I discussed the issues of going into the tent business or opening a sewing school, as you can tell, the tent business won. LightHeart Gear made its debut just 10 months ago at the Franklin North Carolina April Fools Hiker Bash. We sold 3 tents that day, and I had one lady ask if I could make her a purple tent. Customer service being such an important feature, I told her of course, and within 10 days, I met her further up the trail with a purple tent.<br /><br />I think offering tents in a variety of colors gives me a special niche in this niche market. I have made tents in purple, navy blue, green, gray and I even made one in blaze orange. I have had two different women ask for one in pink, but I did talk them out of it. I just can’t see a pink tent sitting out in the woods! I now have new earth tone colors available that will blend into the woods very nicely, and in total I have 24 colors for customers to choose from.<br /> <br />At this time, I make each and every tent myself, I have a wonderful studio in my home where I cut out each tent individually and sew them from start to finish myself. This allows me to keep my inventory low and overhead very low. Starting up in a business like this, not knowing how the tent would be received was scary and I didn’t want to get in over my head.<br /> <br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Judy, we love to be let in on the work-in-progress stuff! Can you let us know what kind of new products you&#8217;re working at the moment?</span><br /> <br />The Duo tent will be available in April. We are having it and the solo now manufactured for us, this will allow me to spend some time on designing a few new items. I will still make the colored versions of the solo tent myself.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/s_spuiOhrt0FydZ5jbdevA?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S4Itp0MpjpI/AAAAAAAABtY/pwOPHEIfWJc/s800/H2.jpg" /></a><br />The many sewing machines, these are the main ones used for the tents.<br /> <br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">What is the most sold piece of gear from LightHeart Gear, the Solo or the Duo? Also, where do your customer come from?</span><br /> <br />So far, the ONLY piece of gear we have for sale is the Solo, but I have a lot of people asking about the Duo tent. My customers come from all over, I’ve sold 2 tents to people in Japan, and one to Holland. I’ve had inquires from several other countries, and I’ve sold tents all over the USA. People hear about me through the hiking grape vine, different internet hiking communities such as WhiteBlaze, Trail Journals, Trail Place etc.<br /> <br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">How works the R&D at LightHeart Gear, do you have a need yourself that you try to fix, or do some of your clients inspire you for new products or ask you for solutions to their problems?</span><br /> <br />A little bit of both. The groups I hike with know what I do, and I test ideas and gear out on them. I also ask them for ideas, what would you like to see in a hiking /backpacking item? One thing I learned from this group is that it’s not just backpackers interested in smaller lighter weight gear, it’s cyclists, kayakers, & motor cyclists, they also want small, compact gear that they can fit into small saddle bags etc, most tent poles are way too long to easily take with them, so we have developed alternative, adjustable tent poles that will fold up quite small.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/qq3AefFnlyvVAx00dSKNIg?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S4Itqg90K3I/AAAAAAAABtg/-ei7-GUfkZo/s800/H3.jpg" /></a><br />The sewing room with parts of the green tent on the table.<br /> <br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Do you think ultralight backpacking will become more popular and break into the mass market, or will it continue to be something for a small group of people?</span><br /> <br />I don’t  think ultralight backpacking is for everyone, just as long distance backpacking isn’t, but for those that want it, the  choices are getting better all the time. I do think it is innovative cottage industries like mine and the others you have interviewed for your blog that are making these inroads. <br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/2xKhgAe_yYlTNj6UdqnZZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S4ItqLJmvAI/AAAAAAAABtc/Z65pXXNdV9g/s800/H4.jpg" /></a><br />A double needle sewing machine making nice seams.<br /> <br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Are you in touch with other cottage manufacturers in Europe, the USA, Canada or other places?</span><br /> <br />LightHeart Gear is very new, but I have met several of the other “cottage industries” at Trail Days or other hiking events, and we have talked about combining our purchase power to get better deals.<br />  <br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Judy, I thank you for taking the time to answer my questions. Is there something you would like to add?</span> <br /><br />Hendrik, it’s been my pleasure. If you (or any of your readers) have ideas for gear items they think would be a good idea, I’m always open to suggestions.</div>

<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">So obviously I had a lot of gear with me on the last tour, and a detailed review about everything would be nice but its not possible due to time constraints. So, inspired by <a href="http://www.petesy.co.uk/?p=2899">PTC&#8217;s &#8220;Kit that broke, kit that didnae, and other stuff before I forget&#8221;</a> series of posts and a post by Markus on the <a href="http://trekking-ultraleicht.de/forum/viewthread.php?forum_id=2&thread_id=858&rowstart=80">trekking-ultraleicht.de Forum</a> I decided that a post in which everything in the pack and worn gets a sentence or two written about would be in order.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/STefa5ubdzTOvQzt651syg?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S32UvIttU3I/AAAAAAAABsg/8yx_TswxgyM/s800/IMG_5236.JPG" /></a><br />Various gear drying out at the cottage.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Spork:</span> Not good if you eat out of bags. Happily <a href="http://qbloggt.blogspot.com/">Q</a> had a 2nd Sea to Summit long handled spoon with him, which he gave me. Very useful and light at 13 g. Sea to Summit = Keeper, Spork = retired if I eat bag food.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="http://hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/2009/09/gear-talk-trail-designs-ti-tri-inferno.html">Ti-Tri + Inferno</a></span>: Didn&#8217;t use it once on the whole trip, as I melted snow on the fire in my Tibetian Titanium 1100 pot. There was just no need for it, and I would leave it at home if I know I will be going to campsites. The pot was perfect, good size for melting snow.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="http://hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/2010/01/platypus-softbottle-platypreserve.html">Platypus</a></span>: Two 1l bottles and the PlatyPreserve for the &#8220;Pepi&#8221;. I borrowed a cozy which held the tea warm for a couple of hours, and if the water froze some massaging of the Platy always gave some water free. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="http://www.drytech.no/realturmat/">Real Turmat</a>, <a href="http://travellunch.de/frameset.htm">Travellunch</a></span>: Both high quality food. Real Turmat slightly better, but at 8€ a meal I&#8217;m not sure if they will be the standard. Travellunch tasted good, and has a wide variety of meals for around 6€. If I have the extra cash I go for them, but Ramen and selfmade food taste as good, if not better.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="http://hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/2010/01/gear-talk-puukko-kuksa-traditional.html">Puukko & Kuksa</a></span>: Both Keepers. Puukko so handy if you need to cut small pieces of wood to start a fire after your quilt collapsed, wouldn&#8217;t miss it for anything. Kuksa isolates excellent and is easy to clean. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="http://hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/2009/12/gear-talk-sleeping-pads-mattresses.html">Multimat Adventure + Multimat Summit Compact 38</a></span>: Perfect Duo, never got cold from down under. Keeper.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="http://hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/2009/09/gear-talk-golite-ultra-20-initial.html">GoLite Ultra 20°</a></span>: Fine till -10°C without a VBL, over that and it collapsed. My mistake, not going to take it if that kind of low temps could surprise me. Still top notch for the summer.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Laufbursche shelter</span>: Slept only one night under it, but it was great. Easy set up, heaps of space, well-thought-out design. Might need to get a own one.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Petzl Tikka Plus</span>: Gets retired. For winter you need a serious lamp, and the Tikka Plus ain&#8217;t it. Some test lamps from <a href="http://www.flashlightshop.de/index.php?cPath=34_264&osCsid=9cdd71965644e534ac49054ccb0b226e">Fenix</a> and <a href="http://www.princetontec.com/">Princeton Tec</a> coming in, expect a post in the coming weeks.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="http://www.julbo-eyewear.com/">Julbo Dolgan sunglasses</a></span>: The Anti Fog only worked half of the time, but otherwise I was glad to have them on those bright and sunny days. 33 g well worth to carry, but need to test them more.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="http://buff.es/en/catalog_headwear.php?t=1">Cyclone Buff</a> & <a href="http://hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/2009/10/gear-talk-merino-buff.html">Merino Buff</a></span>: Perfect for wearing during the day, kept me warm and dry. Wearing the Cyclone around my neck and up over the nose, and the Merino on top. Keeper.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="http://hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/2009/08/gear-talk-rab-microlite-vest.html">Rab Microlite Vest</a> and <a href="http://hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/2009/10/first-look-klattermusen-loke.html">Klättermusen Loke</a></span>: Great duo for wearing at camp and sleeping. No problems with being close to the fire either, the Loke can withstand some sparks without getting holes. Keeper.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="http://hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/2009/11/gear-talk-rab-momentum-jacket-drillium.html">Rab Momentum Jacket and Drillium Pants</a></span>: Both great for when its windy and snowy, though I was able to get the eVent to the limit and had a bit of moisture build up, but when snowshoeing at -15°C that can happen. Keeper.<br /><br />You already know that I liked the <span style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="http://hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/2010/02/gear-talk-golite-pinnacle-2010-backpack.html">GoLite Pinnacle</a></span> and the <span style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="http://hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/2010/02/gear-talk-woolpower-merino-awesomeness.html">Woolpower gear</a></span>, and expect a separate review of the <a href="http://www.integraldesigns.com/">Integral Designs</a> PLQ jacket and pants. I will also give my thoughts on the <a href="http://www.arcticstartup.com/2010/02/18/suntrica-chargers-now-apple-approved/">Suntrica charger</a> in the next few weeks. That&#8217;s pretty much it what I had with me, most of it Keepers as you see, with some stuff needing more trail time. <br /><br />So what about the stuff I didn&#8217;t had with me? Well, a pair of <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/exped-vbl-socks.html"target="_blank">VBL socks</a> would have been a welcome piece of gear to have, because they keep your feet warm and minimize the danger of frostbite. An Cyclone buff for the neck and face also would have been useful, and probably more multiuse than a balaclava? <br /><br />That was it. Questions, comments, observations, recommendations?<br /></span></div>
