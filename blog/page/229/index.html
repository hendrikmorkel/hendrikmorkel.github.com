  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
The second article on winter gear, and its about the <a href="http://fjellpulken.no/index.php?page=shop.product_details&flypage=garden_flypage.tpl&product_id=26&category_id=6&option=com_virtuemart&Itemid=75&lang=en"target="_blank">Fjellpulken XCountry 130 Pulka</a>. Yes, winter is over in the northern hemisphere, but our brethren in the south are facing the cold time of the year, while we will lounge in the sun and enjoy the light for 24 hours! It also allows us to get winter gear with nice discounts ;) So read on to hear about a serious piece of winter gear!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/5687468471/" title="Untitled by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5070/5687468471_a8cff80cca_z.jpg" width="640" height="426" alt=""></a><br />Full frontal.<br /><br />Your first question might be why I didn&#8217;t build myself an <a href="http://www.fjaderlatt.se/2010/04/across-sarek-in-winter-rebooted-rulk.html"target="_blank">incredible Rulk</a> but went for a commercial pulka. The answer is that I am already standing out enough with my UL gear at school, and I didn&#8217;t want to push the boundaries too far, and had only a limited amount of time. That made me look for commercially available, lightweight pulkas. Being in Northern Europe, that means looking at what our Finnish, Swedish and Norwegian companies have to offer. I found what I was looking for at <a href="http://fjellpulken.no/"target="_blank">Fjellpulken</a> in Norway. Some more research showed that the Finnish Distributor <a href="http://hjorth.fi/"target="_blank">Hjorth</a> has his office ten minutes from where I live; after a phone call we arranged that I pick up a pulka for loan for a few trips for them and return it afterwards.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/5687477831/" title="Untitled by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5281/5687477831_65882fa2ec_z.jpg" width="640" height="426" alt=""></a><br />Fully packed.<br /><br />The important bits: A weight of 4,5 kg, it is 130 cm long, 43 cm wide and has a capacity of 235 liters. Yes it is huge! When fully packed, evenly, the average height is around 40 cm, though you can go as high as 80 cm as I have tried. On top of that comes the weight of the pulling beams (about 1900 gram) and the harness (345 gram), so you look at a total weight which is slightly under 7 kg. That looks a lot, but it allows you to carry a lot of gear - 40 kg of food and equipment would be no problem and can be pulled very comfortable.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/5687476803/" title="Untitled by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5181/5687476803_a04854857a_z.jpg" width="426" height="640" alt=""></a><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/5688072204/" title="Untitled by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5061/5688072204_f74a97e274_z.jpg" width="640" height="426" alt=""></a><br />The Pulling Beams and Harness.<br /><br />Lets start with a look at the <a href="http://fjellpulken.no/index.php?page=shop.product_details&flypage=garden_flypage.tpl&product_id=23&category_id=12&option=com_virtuemart&Itemid=75&lang=en"target="_blank">pulling beams</a> and the <a href="http://fjellpulken.no/index.php?page=shop.product_details&flypage=garden_flypage.tpl&product_id=45&category_id=12&option=com_virtuemart&Itemid=75&lang=en"target="_blank">harness</a>. The pulling beams are Fjellpulken&#8217;s basic model, which is a collapsble, strong, and high-quality parallel shaft that has a built-in cushioning spring. The latter is really nice, as it minimizes the bouncing and pushing in your back you get without them. It folds in half and you turn it back over the pulka, making the whole package very compact for transport. The harness is Fjellpulken&#8217;s standard pulk harness, which comes with crossover straps, is made from nylon and features a padded hipbelt. Comfy and sits well, easy and quick to put on and off. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/5687503283/" title="Untitled by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5282/5687503283_0f7b3292aa_z.jpg" width="426" height="640" alt=""></a><br />Easy access via the big zipper in the back.<br /><br />I also have the <a href="http://fjellpulken.no/index.php?page=shop.product_details&flypage=garden_flypage.tpl&product_id=109&category_id=12&option=com_virtuemart&Itemid=75&lang=en"target="_blank">Fjellpulken 20 litre backpack with integrated harness</a> - but I haven&#8217;t tried it; maybe next winter. I did try a cuben fibre backpack while pulling the pulka, but found the best comfort for me is to only wear the harness and have everything in the pulka. A disadvantage of this arrangement is that I need to get my snacks and water from the pulka, so need to ski a few meters back. But it is not a big problem, as it also allows me to sit down on the pulka and rest for a moment. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/5688077906/" title="Untitled by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5181/5688077906_d9f8d63b0b_z.jpg" width="426" height="640" alt=""></a><br />Yeah, it fits a lot of gear! No, I didn&#8217;t take the rocking chair with me =)<br /><br />The pulka itself then. It has an extremely well-gliding bottom material, and creates an ace track for people skiing behind you - a big bonus when travelling in a group. The integrated tarp is waterproof, and keeps your gear safe and dry from snow. You secure the top via elastic cords which are hooked into the opposite cord, and secure the whole package then with buckles. In the front there&#8217;s also a small pocket, I kept the skins for <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2011/01/backcountry-cross-country-skiing.html"target="_blank">my skis</a> in there for quick and easy access. In the back there is a zipper which allows you get at the packed stuff; I kept my thermos and water bottle, together with <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2011/04/sir-joseph-koteka-down-jacket.html"target="_blank">my puffy jacket</a> and snacks there to quickly get to them. <br /><br />While it ain&#8217;t super wide, it distributes the weight very well (as well as you packed it, obviously - heavy stuff towards the back, light stuff in the front!) and hence floats even when packed with 25kg or more with ease over powder snow and tracks alike. Going uphill is as easy as it is for you to ski uphill. I found a diagonal approach best where possible, but little hills like those in Finland even can be tackled full-frontal. Going down is thanks to the stiff pulling beams also less dangerous - no worries that the pulka will crash in your back, as it could be the case with lines. My limited experience showed me that going full throttle down is the most fun, fastest and quickest route. You could take the diagonal approach again, but then you need to master the breaking-on-skis part particularly well.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/5687490293/" title="Untitled by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5289/5687490293_524b691b4f_z.jpg" width="640" height="426" alt=""></a><br />Gear fully secured and wrapped up.<br /><br />The black fabric on the side helps to keep the gear in place, and is also a handy place to put your skis, snowshoes and poles under when travelling. Speaking of travelling, I travelled via train and bus with the pulka and skis, and it worked like a charm. It is so easy to pull all your gear through the city when everything is covered in snow, and lifting it via the belts on top or the side fabric is also no problem. It is also a sure conversation starter when you stand around somewhere!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/5688049888/" title="Untitled by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5189/5688049888_f3cebe60bb_z.jpg" width="640" height="548" alt=""></a><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/5687483121/" title="Untitled by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5181/5687483121_50d52c8832_z.jpg" width="640" height="426" alt=""></a><br />Back and side view.<br /><br />So all in all a really nice piece of gear. It allows you to go on 14+ day winter trips without resupplying, as the Fjellpulken XCountry 130 will hold a massive load of gear and supplies. You could try to put that much gear into a backpack, but I seriously doubt that it would be comfortable or allow you to travel any significant distance. And while this might look like I forgot about lightweight principles, the main reason I got a pulka was to try to adhere to some of the Wilderness Guide school&#8217;s ideas for winter travel. And it is, in all honesty, a pretty nice tool, such a pulka. You could, for example, with ease carry one of the Titanium Goat or Four Dog Ti stoves to heat your shelter, and have a very pleasant time outside in winter! <br /><br />While a pulka is a tool for serious winter adventures, I have seen people load them up with a masses of food and drinks for an winter overnighter! Which goes to show that your imagination is the limit! Fjellpulken also makes pulkas in which to pull your kids - a friend has such a model and reports that his offspring found it a delightful way to travel - for a while, at least =) For more photos, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/sets/72157626647599128/with/5688074430/"target="_blank">head over to the Flickr Album</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/5688074430/" title="Untitled by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5065/5688074430_9d7bd434ab_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt=""></a><br />Fjellpulken XCountry 130 Pulka in action.<br /><br />If you&#8217;re living in Finland and want to try a winter adventure with a Pulka, have a look at the <a href="http://www.varuste.net/tuotetiedot2.asp?_prodid=2058&nimi=Fjellpulken+X-Country+130"target="_blank">Varuste.net</a> and <a href="http://www.scandinavianoutdoorstore.com/en/talviretkeily/ahkiot/x-country-ahkio-130cm/"target="_blank">Scandinavian Outdoor Store</a>, they both also send abroad and have great offers on it at the moment! If you own an outdoor shop in Finland and want these Class A pulkas in your sortiment, contact the friendly folks at <a href="http://hjorth.fi/"target="_blank">Hjorth</a>, the Finnish Distributor, to discuss the matter.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
With spring here, summer on the doorstep, new adventures on my mind, it is time to look back on some pieces of gear which have served me well during the past winter. So in the next days I shall take you back into that cold time, and review a couple items which made winter more enjoyable.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/5638016672/" title="Untitled by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5182/5638016672_837b3ce59a_z.jpg" width="426" height="640" alt=""></a><br /><br />The first piece I&#8217;d like to tell you about is the <a href="http://www.trekking-lite-store.com/trekkingshop/product_info.php?products_id=55">Sir Joseph Koteka Down Jacket</a>, a seriously light down jacket which has kept me very warm between November and March. <a href="http://sirjoseph.cz/index-en.htm"target="_blank">Sir Joseph</a> is a small mountaineering company hailing from the Czech Republic, producing very well made gear for Mountaineers as well as UL backpackers. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/5638060074/" title="Untitled by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5263/5638060074_146e45068e_z.jpg" width="640" height="426" alt=""></a><br /><br />The important bit: Size M is 440 gram on my scale. Of which are 220 gram of 800 cuin down. Which makes it the lightest down jacket on the market. <br /><br />But you know me, weight ain&#8217;t everything. Functionality needs to be there as well. I&#8217;m glad to report that the jacket is able to pack a punch of functionality in those 440 gram, though there are some shortcomings, to which I come latter.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/5638014924/" title="Untitled by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5264/5638014924_22e5f4db57_z.jpg" width="640" height="452" alt=""></a><br /><br />Lets start with the outer and inner material. It is an Sir Joseph exclusive material which they developed themselves called Softex® Micro - it reminds me of Pertex and is quality-wise in the same league. It keeps the down inside, though the breathability ain&#8217;t too good. It is, like Pertex, a very sensitive material - keep away from flying sparks and bushwacking through thorn invested undergrowth I also wouldn&#8217;t do in it. Other than that it is a very nice material, soft and comfortable on the skin, and keeping water and snow out thanks to a very good DWR.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/5638008006/" title="Untitled by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5109/5638008006_d3de60d282_z.jpg" width="426" height="640" alt=""></a><br />Adjustable velcro-cuffs.<br /><br />I&#8217;m not a big fan of velcro, but sir Joseph has made their homework when designing the elastic and adjustable velcro cuffs. I find them really functional, easy to operate with thick gloves, even with one hand. That is really useful in -34°C, when you don&#8217;t want to have heat escape or needing to get your gloves out to adjust something.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/5637437741/" title="Untitled by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5142/5637437741_c7ccfd02e0_z.jpg" width="640" height="426" alt=""></a><br />The hood.<br /><br />You know I am spoilt with the hood of my <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/12/haglofs-ozo-pullover-review.html"target="_blank">Haglöfs OZO</a> so the bar is high, and the Koteka doesn&#8217;t come close to that mark. But it keeps my head warm and the cold wind and snow out, so it does the job. I do think however, that the neck part could be made a tad longer, which would make it easier to turn your head. I also would prefer that if they try to have a sort of visor, that they make it more useful or leave it out - now it is just a tiny shield at the front which doesn&#8217;t have much of a purpose. The elastics for adjusting the hood could also be improved, now they have a tanka on the outside and the elastic cord goes to the inside, which makes adjusting fiddly and involves opening the jacket a bit to do it properly (you can adjust them from the outside, but it&#8217;s suboptimal). Yeah, I am spoilt. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/5638009712/" title="Untitled by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5101/5638009712_ea63572763_z.jpg" width="640" height="426" alt=""></a><br />Two-way zipper.<br /><br />On to the zipper. As the jacket was new, the zipper drove me mad. It was very fiddly to get the two sliders to align properly to be able to close the jacket, so I don&#8217;t know if I got a bad zipper or if YKK, the zipper manufacturer, set out to drive me mad. As usage continued this situation got better, though, and nowadays I can close the zipper without even looking at it. However, the memory remains, and I wonder if a simpler, one way zipper wouldn&#8217;t be much better and also save a few more grams. On the inside it has a wide draft stopper which works very well, and protects the zipper from rubbing against your chin or neck when closed; and the label on the slider gives a good grip for operation, also with thick mitts around your hands.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/5637440385/" title="Untitled by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5146/5637440385_b5cd8ef7a5_z.jpg" width="426" height="640" alt=""></a><br />A long back keeps my bum warm =)<br /><br />The hem has two tankas and double elastic cord to adjust tightness, which works well, though I think one tanka and one cord would be enough and cut some more weight down. The long back has a good cut and goes just over my buttocks to keep them warm in the blazing cold we had, and thanks to the elastic hem it stays that way. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/5638017246/" title="Untitled by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5187/5638017246_8b2587e6c6_z.jpg" width="426" height="640" alt=""></a><br />Pocket zipper which you pull down to close. Genius.<br /><br />The Koteka jacket comes with two zippered hand pockets which are massive in size, I can fit in a pair of thick woolen gloves, an extra Buff, windproof over-mitts, a few chocolate bars, my knife, compass, firesteel, a map&#8230; Yeah, they&#8217;re big. Lovely. Warm. And their zippers you pull down to close, which is so much smarter than normal zippers (which you close pulling up). This makes them safer and easier to close, even with thick gloves. Perfect. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/5637435785/" title="Untitled by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5188/5637435785_5348cbbecd_z.jpg" width="426" height="640" alt=""></a><br /><br />About the construction of the jacket then. Now according to some research on BPL it doesn&#8217;t matter if the garment is sewn-through or baffled, but for what its worth, the Koteka jacket has H-chambers which should to be, according to other research, warmer. All I can tell you is that it is massively warm, and if it&#8217;s less than -20°C then I am fine with only a 200 Merino longsleeve beneath it. It is very warm, and I never got cold wearing it. That&#8217;s subjective field science!<br /><br />The bottom line is that despite some small shortcomings it is a topnotch jacket for people who go hiking in winter and seriously cold temperatures. It comes in black. It is the lightest down jacket on the market, with the most down (some competitors of this jacket include the Rab Infinity, PHD Yukon, and Montane North Star which are all heavier and have less down!). It keeps me warm in -36°C and a stiff breeze. It packs into a 8 l stuff sack with spare room for your down booties or extra socks. It has a great cut for us lean and athletic guys, with enough room underneath to wear up to three layers. It&#8217;s black. And made in Europe. Yeah, I&#8217;m gonna keep it.<br /><br />If you too want to wear the lightest down jacket on the market, the <a href="http://www.trekking-lite-store.com/trekkingshop/product_info.php?products_id=55"target="_blank">Sir Joseph Koteka down jacket</a>, and earn yourself a 10% discount on one order of over 100€ at <a href="http://www.trekking-lite-store.com/trekkingshop/?refID=hif"target="_blank">trekking-lite-store.com</a> on any products you purchase, then all you need to do is <a href="http://www.facebook.com/trekkinglitestore"target="_blank">Like the trekking-lite-store.com Facebook page</a> and when you check out your order give them the Coupon code &#8221;<i>Finland10</i>&#8221; and voilá - you save 10% on your sweet UL goodies!
