  <div class="entry-content"><p>While Hiking in Finland is my main outlet for all outdoor related things (my personal blog being the place for everything else), I am increasingly also writing for other publications. It is fun, opens the topic up to new people, and I get paid a little for it as well. Here some recent articles I wrote.</p>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-YaeQ8MeOkZg/TiwZkAgyRGI/AAAAAAAAFCE/zPv_dqLVvto/s896/P1030003.jpg" imageanchor="1" style=""><img border="0" height="672" width="896" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-YaeQ8MeOkZg/TiwZkAgyRGI/AAAAAAAAFCE/zPv_dqLVvto/s896/P1030003.jpg" /></a></div>

<p>&lt;a href=”http://www.visitfinland.com/article/escape-the-hustle-and-bustle/”target=”_blank”&gt;Escape the Hustle and Bustle&lt;/a&gt; is a trip report I wrote for the new &lt;a href=”http://www.visitfinland.com/”target=”_blank”&gt;VisitFinland.com&lt;/a&gt; website. It’s photo heavy and light on text, and recounts an overnighter to Nuuksio, a National Park an hour away from Helsinki.</p>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="http://distilleryimage2.instagram.com/367ad9ca993d11e19dc71231380fe523_7.jpg" imageanchor="1" style=""><img border="0" height="612" width="612" src="http://distilleryimage2.instagram.com/367ad9ca993d11e19dc71231380fe523_7.jpg" /></a></div>

<p>&lt;a href=”http://www.naturkompaniet.se/Startpage/Start.aspx”target=”_blank”&gt;Naturkompaniet&lt;/a&gt; is a Swedish chain of outdoor stores, and 365 is their free magazine. I was interviewed for their <i>Duellen</i> series, in which two people with opposite standpoints discuss the merits of their POV. In this case I took the side for Ultralight Backpacking, while Lars Fält took the side for traditional backpacking. It’s a polite affair, with me highlighting the skills and philosophy of UL backpacking; though Gear Nerds will be happy to see Locus Gear, Laufbursche, Hyperlite Mountain Gear, Ktabatic Gear and the BushBuddy getting a mention and illustration in the mag. It is free, so if you’re in Sweden, go pick a Magazine up at your local Naturkompaniet Store!</p>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

<p>Finally, if German language is something that you understand, and you’re interested in Scandinavia, then give &lt;a href=”http://www.norrmagazin.de/”target=”_blank”&gt;NORR Magazine&lt;/a&gt; a read. For their spring issue I wrote a column; it is a more philosophical text, in which I look back on how I started to become interested in the outdoors, and wonder what my son’s outdoor adventure will be like. Pick it up for 4,90€ at the book store, or &lt;a href=”http://www.norrmagazin.de/abo/”target=”_blank”&gt;take out an subscription&lt;/a&gt; and get a sweet present on top.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>During my education to become a Wilderness Guide, I was in need of a pair of binoculars for bird watching and nature observation. While there are plenty of companies who make high quality binoculars, I ended up with a pair of &lt;a href=”http://www.vortexoptics.com/product/vortex-viper-hd-8x32-binocular”target=”_blank”&gt;Vortex Optics Viper HD 8x32 Binoculars&lt;/a&gt;, which were for me the best combination of quality, weight, and viewing.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7196857430/" title="Vortex Viper by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8008/7196857430_31f07eb48c_c.jpg" width="800" height="342" alt="Vortex Viper" /></a></p>

<p>You might wonder why I got a pair of binos instead of a much lighter and smaller monocular. This is mostly because the binos came on trips where I was working as a Guide and birdwatching trips, where weight and size were of less concern. A pair of binos is just much easier to handle for a client, because they’re familiar with how it works: Hold it to both your eyes, adjust and see. Being able to hand your client a good pair of binos, which allows them to see that Black Woodpecker you just spotted, is making their experience just so much better. Also for kids a pair of binos is much easier to use, as they can hold it with both hands to their eyes, allowing for a more stable view (the same goes for adults, obviously =). It is very rewarding to see their faces light up when they look through the glass and see that bird you just pointed out to them!</p>

<p>So yes, binos. The Viper HD uses roof prisms, which allow for a more compact and narrow design. To counter the reduced light transmission this design has (in comparison with Porro-prisms), Vortex has developed and applied a bunch of very smart features. Multi-layer coatings provide the clearest, brightest, most color-accurate images possible, while XR anti-reflective coatings increase light transmission for maximum brightness. Phase Correction enhances resolution and contrast, and HD extra-low dispersion glass deliver an impressive resolution and color fidelity, resulting in High Definition images - that’s what they claim, and what I can confirm. Add in that the fixed alignment in roof-prism designs means the binoculars normally won’t need re-collimation (re-aligning of the prisms), and in the long-term you’re possibly even saving money.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7196560782/" title="Where are they? by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5329/7196560782_04cec86671_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Where are they?" /></a></p>

<p>The Viper binos are waterproof and fogproof; while I haven’t submersed them to test the former, the fogproofness has been tested on countless occasions. The exterior lenses have an ArmorTek coating, which makes them less prone to scratches, oil and dirt - not that I’m carrying them around carelessly, though it is good to know that when by accident they’d drop on the ground, or in a stiff breeze at the beach, they’re protected. The rubber outer provides a non-slip grip, and also gives you the durable external protection you want.</p>

<p>All this high-tech and durability obvious comes at a cost. At 663 gram, including tethered objective lens covers for both ends and the Comfort neck strap, I don’t consider the Viper ultralight, but it is still one of the most durable &amp; lightest binos on the market. While the 90 gram of the padded carrying case aren’t really necessary (it are very rugged binos), it is a good extra protection.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7196580250/" title="Vortex Viper by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7096/7196580250_d625e37d9b_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Vortex Viper" /></a></p>

<p>So much for the tech and weight of the Viper HD binos; but how are they in use? After almost a year of using them in various situations - from a &lt;a href=”http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2012/01/archipelago-national-park-trip-report.html”target=”_blank”&gt;bird watching trip in the Archipelago&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=”http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2011/09/upitrek-family-trip-guiding.html”target=”_blank”&gt;using them at work guiding clients&lt;/a&gt;, they always have been dependable, delivering sharp views on far away wildlife. It is especially when outside with clients a very useful tool, because a good pair of binoculars that you can give your client in the hand, allowing them for example to see that White-tailed Eagle sailing high above you, is something that will help make their outdoor experience much more memorable, if not unforgettable. The twist eyecups help here to allow for a comfortable custom fit when looking through them, and with the very easy to use Diopter people can quick &amp; easy adjusts for differences in their eyes. The Center Focus Wheel of the binos lets one quickly adjust the focus, and even kids know immediately how to use them. The Viper easily adjust in the middle to different widths so that they also work perfectly for kids.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7196562142/" title="Vortex Viper by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7227/7196562142_d36bd63a03_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Vortex Viper" /></a></p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>
<p>A highly functional pair of binoculars, made for the outdoors, for observing wildlife and looking far away, in a small, compact and reasonably light package. At &lt; $500 they’re not cheap, but you invest into a high quality piece of kit that your kids can inherit. And should something go broken, then Vortex’s &lt;a href=”http://www.vortexoptics.com/content/vip_warranty”target=”_blank”&gt;VIP Unconditional Lifetime Warranty&lt;/a&gt; has you covered. If you’re in the market for a pair of binos, I can highly recommend the &lt;a href=”http://www.vortexoptics.com/category/viper_hd_binoculars”target=”_blank”&gt;Vortex Optics Vipers&lt;/a&gt;.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I am interviewing Jan Betros from Sweden, Founder of Röjk. &lt;a href=”http://rojk.se/”target=”_blank”&gt;Röjk&lt;/a&gt; is a young company which makes garments that are very functional, stylish and have proper ethical and sustainable credentials. In this interview Jan highlights how he started the company, the ideas that drive his designs and what we can expect in the future from Röjk! <br /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7202349350/" title="Me hiking Yellow mountains in China by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7238/7202349350_19f93ff2d7_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Me hiking Yellow mountains in China" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Jan, please briefly introduce yourself and tell us who you are. Since when are you backpacking &amp; bikepacking, and how did you start?</strong><br />
I am rased and born in Stockholm near the archipelagos, mountains, sea and nature was always close. I spent my youth as a professional gymnast and finally when I was 21 I moved to Annecy in the French Alps to spend time for hiking, skiing, rock climbing and cycling. For five years I was backpacking and skiing around the world and earned my living by working in ski- and mountainshops. My interest for making innovative sportswear grew and finally I started my studies at University of Derby with Performance Sportswear Design. With the help of my seamstress grandmother in Sweden I made my first prototype of the Tvister Helmet Hood who in 2007 won the Innovation For Extremes Prize for best design and innovation. After the award I got a lot of publicity and the brand RÖJK SUPERWEAR was introduced to the market in fall 2009.<br /></p>

<p><strong>How often are you outdoors hiking, skiing or backpacking nowadays?</strong><br />
Unfortunately not as often as I used to, but at least I get to make awesome gear for everyone who spends time in the outdoors :)<br /></p>

<p><strong>Are you more of a “weekend hiker” or do you have some long distance trips under your belt?</strong><br />
Nowadays I am more of a weekend hiker because of a lot of work but I always plan at least one or two long backpacking trips every year.<br /></p>

<p><strong>Which category would you put yourself in: SUL, UL, Lightweight or Bushcraft</strong>? What is your typical baseweight?**<br />
Well as weekend hiker I hike rather light, average is around 30 - 45 liters but for my backpacking trips where I am aways for at least 2 or 3 month I carry 60-70 liters.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7202350426/" title="The Röjk Superwear base.2 by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7096/7202350426_ecc38ed75c_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="The Röjk Superwear base.2" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Please tell us where the name “Röjk” came from, and what it stands for.</strong><br />
RÖJK is a shortage for RÖJÅK which is an expression for the PERFECT RIDE. It’s all about the perfect ride and making things perfect :)<br /></p>

<p><strong>Röjk designs functional garments, which are Made in Portugal &amp; Sweden. Can you tell us how the idea to start the company emerged and how you see its future?</strong>
Röjk makes innovative and attractive garments. We make all our garments in Portugal, all beanies and socks in Sweden. The idea for Röjk is to make garments that look good, with versatile use. For example our Helmet Hood can be used for running, skiing, hiking and cycling. Our liner socks can be used for hiking, skiing, running, cycling and with jeans or a suit instead of a cotton sock! We will continue so make more versatile garments mainly for the average people, backpackers and for everyone who likes to spend time int the outdoors. Garments will include running, light hiking, cycling, yoga, backpacking, travelling, surfing, and for everyone who enjoys the good things in life :)</p>

<p><strong>What makes Röjk different from other outdoor companies?</strong>
Well many things actually, first of all we are a small and independent company and they are big companies! We are focusing on the average person who is not particularly a top athlete but who likes adventures and sports but wants something that is of great quality and good looking as well. The old and big outdoor brands are focusing on the hardcore user and uses the term “Outdoor” but for us we are the new and next generation and we are focusing on “what is now” and we rather use the term Backpacker and Adventurer. I try to find gaps rather than making things that already exists.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7202348814/" title="Me backpacking in Portugal by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7090/7202348814_8c7632b54d_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" alt="Me backpacking in Portugal" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Your company makes its garments in Europe, and uses recyclable materials, so does pretty well in environmental terms. What brought this decision on?</strong>
Well I thought that if I want to make garments that are suitable for spending most time in nature then of course I should try to be nice to nature. Simple as that :)</p>

<p><strong>Röjk is starting to get more exposure in outdoor blogs lately; how about magazines, are they featuring your goods?</strong> 
We have only been on the market for 3 years and things are going fast. We have not been active with making press releases etc. - mostly because we wanted to make the company grow a little bit by itself. Now and then we can see our stuff in both national and international magazines, it’s great that they chose our stuff and to write good things about us. </p>

<p>**Can you tell us a bit how you went about the design process of the Tvister Hoody, and where the inspiration came from? **
I wanted to develop the ultimate and versatile hoody of all time, something that no one else had made and so simply that it would make the big brands wonder why they never thought of that, and so I did :). I started to put on many different layers of tops from layer 1 to layer 3 and eliminated everything that was uncomfortable such as zips, pockets, seams on wrong places and finally I narrowed it down to what i need and do not need in my hoody. Finally the design of the garment had tvisted arms, a balaclava shaped hood that can be used under a helmet and thereof the name. When I was done with the construction I thought I would make the design different and something that everyone can recognize and I made the asymmetrical colors.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7202348268/" title="bild by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7226/7202348268_15a54a074f_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="bild" /></a></p>

<p><strong>You use a lot of bright colours in your garments, and aren’t afraid to mix it up. This and your garments asymmetric seams make Röjk garments stand out. Are you do this to simply differentiate yourself, or what’s the story behind these?</strong><br />
Well at first I understood that I have to stand out and I wanted people to see what a Röjk garment is without having to see the name. I thought that why would the shops want to buy Röjk if it looks like everything else so I would be more safe by standing out rather than not standing out. And in the end of the day I want to make garments that I like to wear :)<br /></p>

<p><strong>Jan, we love to be let in on the work-in-progress stuff! Can you let us know what kind of new products you’re working on at the moment?</strong><br />
Well, we are developing our first spring/ summer range that will be on the markets spring 2014 which will include bikewear, running and backpacking. And for next fall we have developed some cool compression garments and more hoodys and T-shirts in merino wool, I love hoodys and t-shirts and can’t have enough of them :)<br /></p>

<p><strong>Any new lightweight materials that have you all excited?</strong><br />
There’s so many but I am working really close with PrimaLoft right now to develop a lightweight range in PrimaLoft.<br /></p>

<p><strong>How works the R&amp;D at Röjk, do you have a need yourself that you try to fix, or do some of your clients inspire you for new products and ask you for solutions to their problems?</strong><br />
So far it has been mostly me finding new solutions but as we grow we are getting a lot of feedback and many requests. We also have our friends who we call “Superheros”, they are professional athletes who can test our garments and new developments on an intense way and give us a great feedback. <br /></p>

<p><strong>Where do your customer come from?</strong><br />
Tricky question, it varies a lot but mostly from they’re adventurers, backpackers and the average person who is off for a short trip and wants something really good &amp; attractive!<br /></p>

<p><strong>Do you think the lightweight backpacking principles will become more popular and break into the mass market, or will it continue to be something for a small group of people?</strong><br />
I think it is growing and more people are asking for it, however I think that the demand is higher than the supply.<br /></p>

<p><strong>Are you in touch with other smaller manufacturers in Europe, the USA, Japan, and other places?</strong><br />
Not really as we have not had the time really to focus on others but we have plans on working more close with other small manufacturers.<br /></p>

<p><strong>What is your own favorite backpack, sleep system and shelter?</strong><br />
I just bought an OSPREY Exos 58 wich will be perfect for my shorter trips, I have a Hilleberg Nallo 2 GT and Thermarest NeoAir Xlite. I have so much gear for different occasions.<br /></p>

<p><strong>Any other favourite piece of gear which you always carry with you?</strong><br />
I’m a bit of a gear-nerd and I have many bit’s and pieces :)<br /></p>

<p><strong>When and where was your last backpacking/ skiing/ bikepacking trip?</strong><br />
This March I went with a friend to Switzerland for one week to ski. It was great, we stayed in a French town called Bulle and everyday we went to a new place to ski. Last summer I went to Australia for three months. First I went skiing for 2 months in the snowy mountains of NSW and then went off backpacking and rock climbing for a month. I also have a big crush on Portugal and I go there at least five times every year mainly for the manufacturing of our great garments and while I’m there I go for backpacking, surfing, rock climbing and I enjoy the nice wine :) <br /></p>

<p><strong>And where is your dream backpacking/ skiing/ bikepacking trip taking you?</strong><br />
I really need to go back to New Zeeland and see all of it. I plan to go to Patagonia this fall to go rock climbing and I want to ski in Japan, damn so many places I still need to explore and lets not forget about Finland, I need to see more of Finland as well.<br /></p>

<p><strong>Are you planning to get out for a trip soon, and enjoy the Swedish spring?</strong><br />
Yes, me and my girlfriend are first going hiking Kungsleden in the north of Sweden for a week, then I’m going with some friends to Riksgränsen to celebrate Swedish midsummer and do some late spring skiing. We are also going to Portugal for two months to do some backpacking, surfing and take a language course in Portuguese. Besides from these plans I always have many spontaneous trips going, live is good :)<br /></p>

<p><strong>Jan, I thank you very mucho for taking the time to answer my questions =) Is there something you would like to add?</strong><br />
