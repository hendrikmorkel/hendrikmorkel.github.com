Midsummer was this weekend (and the longest day aka summer solstice was last Monday) so now here up north we slowly edge again towards the dark and cold time of the year, winter. Time to think about the winter setup and procure the winter tent and stove, build a rulk and get the 3 meter long forest skis. But until then I&#8217;ll try and find the time to do a couple of summer hikes.<br /><br /><object width="800" height="440"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=6686768&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=ff9933&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=6686768&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=ff9933&amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="800" height="440"></embed></object><br /><br />Nick from Skills for Wild Lives has a great post titled &#8221;<a href="http://www.skillsforwildlives.com/2010/06/simplify-or-die/">Simplify of Die</a>&#8221; which I urge you to read. It&#8217;s about UL & lightweight backpacking, bushcraft, and the environment - excellent read.<br /><br />Hamilton asks <a href="http://traversejapan.wordpress.com/2010/06/23/114/">how many Dollars (or Euros or Yen or Pound) it takes to lighten your pack</a>, and it is worth reading if you plan to go lighter.<br /><br />In the MYOG vein Mungo injected some fresh ideas, as he makes a <a href="http://www.mungosaysbah.com/2010/06/tyvek-fedex-pouch-converted-to-camping.html">stuff sack out of a FedEx tyvek envelope</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/jFJD5nkwH7KesWI4_oosfzWiupv70N-RGKSfyQFBX78?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TBukH6xr-GI/AAAAAAAACzk/aWwNZbe5xPw/s800/P1040331.jpg" /></a><br /><br />Under gear which was reviewed last week we find the <a href="http://www.fjaderlatt.se/2010/06/tn-laser-photon-light-and-not-half-bad.html">Terra Nova Laser Photon review</a> by Jörgen Johansson, which is still one of the lightest double skin tents on the market.<br /><br />Roman has a <a href="http://lighthiker.wordpress.com/2010/06/25/first-look-katabaticgear-palisade-quilt/">first look at the Katabatic Gear Palisade quilt</a>, which is revolutionizing the quilt market quite a bit.<br /><br />Fraser has a review of <a href="http://mcalisterium.wordpress.com/2010/06/21/whisky-the-perfect-in-camp-drink/">the perfect in-camp drink, Whisky</a>.

Matias Hyde, who is planning to cycle around the world (or part of it!) and sketch while doing so, made a <a href="http://www.matiashydetravels.com/2010/06/the-way-of-st-james-days-8-to-10/">trip along the Way of St. James</a> and it looks like he took the less busy route.

It was an interesting week. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Nordic-Lightpacking/128701720487438">Nordic Lightpacking got its own Facebook Fansite</a>, and if you become a Fan it is an easy way stay on top of developments at NOL, as well as easy access to all our new articles.

Awesome red rock formations, cougar tracks, cows and toads make for a great read. Superb photography, as well.<br /><br /><a href="http://ulsterwalker.blogspot.com/2010/06/mourne-way-marathon-2010.html">Keith Brownrigg did the Mourne Way Marathon</a> this year, and in the 4:36:11 he run it in he even found time to snap some photos. His account is interesting, maybe this is something for the people hiking on the Fastlane!<br /><br />Mark&#8217;s trip report to the <a href="http://backpackingnorth.blogspot.com/2010/06/porcupine-mountains-michigan-trip.html">Porcupine Mountains in Michigan</a> has some sweet b/w photographs, and colour where colour is need.

Goes to show that video is becoming more and more popular among outdoor bloggers, which is great, I think!<br /><br />Talking of video, Jason Klass is the man to look for. Part 3 of his &#8221;<a href="http://www.geartalkwithjasonklass.com/2010/06/how-to-choose-alcohol-stove-part-3-diy.html">How To Choose An Alcohol Stove - DIY Or Buy?</a>&#8221; is out for your enjoyment and gives you advice on the options of commercial alcohol stoves or which tools you&#8217;d need for a MYOG project.<br /><br />This week Angelo from &#8220;The Creak of Boots&#8221; wrote an interesting <a href="http://creakofboots.blogspot.com/2010/06/gear-test-jacks-r-better-shenandoah.html">review on the Jacks &#8216;R&#8217; Better Shenandoah quilt</a> and his reasons for giving the quilt a go over a sleeping bag.

While I am at the <a href="http://www.riihimaenmessut.fi/en/">Riihimäki Outdoor fair</a> - the biggest Outdoor fair in Finland - and will be searching for lightweight and UL goodies from the Nordic manufacturers, you can lounge in your favourite chair and enjoy what happened this week in the outdoor blogsphere.<br /><br />To start off, you might have realized that I did a little re-design of the site (obviously not if you read it via RSS =). I want the design to be light, easy and less cluttered, just as I like to be on the trail. I sorted some stuff out, and you now can access all <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/p/reviews.html">gear reviews & first looks</a>, the <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/p/interviews.html">interviews</a> and my <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/p/reading-list.html">reading list</a> - which now includes books and the blogroll - via the above links. And I also did a little change to the <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/p/about-faq.html">About / FAQ</a> page, so go check that out if you&#8217;re of the curious kind!<br /><br />Secondly, I&#8217;d like to encourage you to share the content here more - this can easily be done with the share button under each post. Move your mouse over it and choose among Facebook, Twitter, Google, Delicious and other social networks to share it. You can start with this article! If you like the content please feel free to Flattr me - here you can <a href="https://flattr.com/">sign up for Flattr</a> and start using it, it is a great idea and I hope that many more start to use it on their blogs. Finally, an easy way to follow the developments here is to become a Follower by clicking the &#8220;Follow&#8221; button on the right; that brings the articles here right into your RSS Reader of choice and you let me and others know that you like this site!<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/WtB68R20ajnkS8tWMX9urYhiI5wKU10e5tzMb1Q04iQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TA6NsfPbBPI/AAAAAAAACwA/ucVOieYLjn4/s800/Discussing%2001%20%281%20of%201%29.jpg" /></a><br /><br />Video is the medium of the internet - I have said this before - and Londonbackpacker confirms this with his videos of the <a href="http://londonbackpackers.blogspot.com/2010/06/tgo-challenge-2010-day-seveneight-video.html">TGO Challenge</a>. Really cool stuff, so check them out!<br /><br />The Shed Dweller took his boys out <a href="http://sheddwellersmoments.blogspot.com/2010/06/woodland-wild-camp.html">for fishing and wildcamping</a>, and it looks like they had fun.<br /><br />Minimalgear took his son and wife on a <a href="http://minimalgear.blogspot.com/2010/06/solomons-first-trip.html">family trip</a>, with them the Tarptent Hogback, and realized that UL is perfect for such occasions.<br /><br />Knilch, MYOG-man extraordinaire, has little time but the time he has he spends <a href="http://ultraknilch.blogspot.com/2010/06/neue-rubrik-foto-des-tages.html">running up mountains behind his house</a>. Nice weather, great view.<br /><br />Trailblaze went on a five day trip to Knoydart in Scotland, and reports about swamps, lochs and mountains <a href="http://www.trailblaze.de/schottland-knoydart.html">in his trip report</a>.<br /><br />Also the Auld Blug went on a <a href="http://bluggery.blogspot.com/2010/06/scotland.html">trip to Scotland</a> and took along his DIY kajak Sedna - what a beautiful boat!<br /><br />Do you like clouds, mountains, interesting rock formations, wildlife and waterfalls, all with plenty of sunshine? Then check out Down The Trail&#8217;s trip in <a href="http://www.downthetrail.com/grand-canyon/hiking-upstream-in-phantom-creek-and-the-miners-route/">Phantom Creek and the Miners Route</a>, which is fantastic.<br /><br />James from Backpackingbongos did a <a href="http://backpackingbongos.wordpress.com/2010/06/09/backpacking-the-rhinogs-a-south-to-north-traverse/">south to north traverse of the Rhinogs</a> and the scenery was epic while the findings were Metal!<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/WM-B9sx8-w62PiX9wv0iea3_ZFCDtugbu0uvLrhUYgM?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TAvbFnuHsCI/AAAAAAAACtc/3nKPrAM2AKo/s800/P1020234.JPG" /></a><br /><br />In the gear department video is also on the advance, this week Darren gave us <a href="http://whitespider1066.com/2010/06/stove-talk-episode-5/">Episode five of his Stove Talk</a> which is about the Vargo Titanium Woodburning stove.<br /><br />Richard has a look at the <a href="http://maceachain.blogspot.com/2010/06/worlds-lightest-gas-stove-gosystem-fly.html">GoSystems Fly Ti</a> and wonders if it is the worlds lightest gas stove, while Roger tested the <a href="http://www.nielsenbrownoutdoors.com/2010/06/monatauk-gnat-update.html">Monatauk Gnat</a> and got pretty similar numbers. The smart person knows that it is one and the same stove just with a different brand written on it, as <a href="http://lighthiker.wordpress.com/2010/06/10/monatauk-gnat-vs-fire-maple-fms-116t/">Roman points out</a>.<br /><br />New tent needed? Maz, new to the blogsphere (Go say welcome!), reviewed his <a href="http://www.journeymantraveller.com/2010/06/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul1-and-seedhouse.html">Big Agnes Fly Creek UL1 and Seedhouse SL1</a> and compared it to the Vaude Power Lizard.<br /><br />Joe wrote a review on the <a href="http://thunderinthenight.blogspot.com/2010/06/inov8-terroc-330-shoe-review.html">Inov-8 Terroc 330</a> and concluded that he would buy a pair again if this one went broke today, so go read his reasoning!<br /><br />And also I did a short review on the <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/06/gear-that-worked-and-gear-that-didnt-ii.html">gear that worked and the gear that didn&#8217;t</a> while being in Sweden. A good discussion going on there, please join in!<br /><br />And also in the &#8220;Others&#8221; section, Video reigns supreme as this one shows: <br /><br /><object width="640" height="505"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/zwmwxkD86Ec&hl=en_US&fs=1&color1=0x234900&color2=0x4e9e00"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/zwmwxkD86Ec&hl=en_US&fs=1&color1=0x234900&color2=0x4e9e00" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="505"></embed></object><br /><br />Dressed in Dirt gives us some insights on <a href="http://www.dressedindirt.com/2010/06/why-you-should-hike-in-a-skirt-or-at-least-think-about-it/">why we should hike in a skirt - or at least think about it</a>. If pee-ability is something you&#8217;re looking for, give it a read.<br /><br />If Bushcraft is your thing, I reckon this Guide on &#8221;<a href="http://wildelycreative.wordpress.com/2010/05/24/how-to-make-primitive-kilns/">How to make primitive kilns</a>&#8221; is right up your alley. Now I just need to find some clay&#8230;<br /><br />Are you something wondering about the people you meet on the trail? Here&#8217;s a run-down of the <a href="http://hikingboots.com/blog/11-types-of-people-on-the-trail/">11 Types of people you meet on a hike</a> - though it seems they missed the elusive lightpacker!<br /><br />I recommend you check out <a href="http://traversejapan.wordpress.com/">Traverse Japan</a> which is the epic upcoming trip of a coast to coast in Japan with a visit to all the peaks over 3000m. And while you&#8217;re there, give Hamilton some <a href="http://traversejapan.wordpress.com/2010/06/04/gimme-shelter/">feedback on his shelter</a>, will ya?!<br /><br />Finally, inspired by the <a href="http://www.nordiclightpacking.com/">Nordic Fellowship of lightweight & UL bloggers</a>, hrXXLight has some <a href="http://hrxxlight.com/?p=353">thoughts on creating a European scene</a> - maybe you want to let him know your opinion on that matter?<br /><br /><a href="http://flattr.com/thing/985/Hiking-in-Finland-Ultralight-Backpacking-Blog" target="_blank"><img src="http://api.flattr.com/button/button-compact-static-100x17.png" title="Flattr this" border="0" /></a></div>
