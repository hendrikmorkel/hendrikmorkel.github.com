  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Monday morning, interview morning. I&#8217;m really excited to be able to present you a little know cottage, <a href="http://www.elementalhorizons.com/">Elemental Horizons</a>, today. Matthew Lagas-Rivera is the owner of this still very young company, which makes a variety of gear for lightweight backpackers as well as kayakers and canoeing folks. And because he didn&#8217;t like to waste material, he developed very stylish garments in addition to his packs and accessories! But please, take that cup of coffee or tea, open up another work related tab in case your boss stops by so that you look busy, and enjoy!<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/HzD2jdMHMPWBkA7HKgVFdA?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6ZqxodrgPI/AAAAAAAAB7s/YOGjF9jUwvY/s800/JMT08.jpg" /></a><br />Matthew on the John Muir Trail with Half Dome in the background, August 2008.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Matthew, please briefly introduce yourself and tell us who you are. Since when are you backpacking, and how did you start? How often are you out backpacking nowadays?</span><br /> <br />My name is Matthew Lagas-Rivera. I grew up in central North Carolina which is a great place for people who love all sorts of outdoor activities, you are close to both the mountains and the coast, nearly equidistant to both. My parents were avid campers when I was younger and many of my fondest memories are of time spent camping, fishing, canoeing, and sailing. I fell in love with hiking, backpacking, and rock climbing in College in the mountains of North Carolina where I often hiked and climbed 5 to 6 days a week (after my work and school responsibilities were over of course). During this time was when I designed my first pack. <br /> <br />After living in the mountains for about 6 years I moved back to central NC where I began traveling extensively to pursue the outdoor activities I love. I regularly climbed and hiked all over the southeastern US. Also during this time I began doing a lot of sea kayaking. I began instructing and guiding for a couple of local companies and doing several week to two week long trips a year. 2000 and 2001 were big years for me. I started in March 2000 and paddled from the NC/SC state line to the NC/VA state line approximately 330 miles in a total of 5 weeks. Then in September I did an 11 day self supported bike tour on the Blue Ridge Parkway totaling 520miles. In January and February 2001 my wife and I traveled to Australia and New Zealand for 6 weeks where we hiked, paddled, snorkeled and experienced as much of those two amazing countries as possible. I also applied and was accepted to a sea kayak instructor course with the National Outdoor Leadership School (N.O.L.S.). I participated in the NOLS instructor course where we paddled more than 200 miles of the outer coast of British Columbia, Canada and finished off the 2001 season as an instructor on a course in Prince William Sound, Alaska. <br /> <br />I now live in Southport, NC, a small town on the coast, with my wife and son. I get to go back packing a few times a year, mostly shorter trips, as my life and work responsibilities allow. Unfortunately I have been plagued on recent trips with problems in my knees and hips, and have been forced off trail on several recent trips to prevent further injury. These experiences have spurred in me an even greater interest in light weight gear and methodology. My son is at an age now where he is really excited about camping and doing things in the outdoors and I am trying to cultivate that interest as much as possible so that hopefully he will develop the same love of the outdoors that I have. So far I have a great camping partner in him.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/4wEUyXL2MO81D9PEVsAw9g?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6ZqwNNgd3I/AAAAAAAAB7k/zq-FiDTaEEc/s800/Hikingwithson09.jpg" /></a><br />Matthew with his son as they are departing on a day hike at Cliffs of the Neuse State Park early winter 2009.<br /> <br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Are you a lightweight/ UL backpacker? If so, what is your typical baseweight?</span><br /> <br />I consider myself a light weight backpacker. My base weight varies depending on the weather and time of year, but is generally in the 14 to 17 pound range. I like to experiment with different gear lists and try different things and so my weights can vary quite a bit. Because of reoccurring knee and hip problems I am actively exploring ways to lighten my load even more.<br /> <br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Elemental Horizons makes a some very original gear, from the Northern Lite backpack over to the Utility Belt and other accessories and apparel. Can you tell us a bit how you decided to start the company, how you developed the Northern Lite bag and where you plan to take the company?</span><br /> <br />Elemental Horizons has grown out of my love of the outdoors, my personal philosophy of learning and problem solving, and the fact that I am a hopeless gear nut. I have lived, worked, and traveled in the outdoors and outdoor industry for as long as I can remember, and my love of the outdoors and passion for technical, fully featured gear drives me and my products.<br /> <br />Many of the products that I make with Elemental Horizons have developed out of personal wants or needs. My first product was a kayak paddle bag, which I designed to protect my paddles while I traveled. The original bags were as much attractive as they were functional but were incredibly time consuming and expensive to produce. They were a major learning process for me about design and manufacturing. My fleece hats and sunglasses cases came about in an effort to conserve materials and reduce the amount of waste produced by my company. The original paddle bags had multi-color fleece exteriors and created a great deal of scrap. I designed the hats and sunglasses cases to better utilize this waste and because I love wearing a comfy warm fleece hat on cool days. <br /> <br />The packs have been an ongoing design and development process. I designed my first back pack in college more than 10 years ago. But at the time I did not know how to sew let alone make a pack and so I drew it up in one of my many idea books and did not do anything with it for years, until eventually I learned to sew. One day I was talking to George at AntiGravityGear and decided to make that pack. Well, some of the features that I want to incorporate in that design have proved to be a little more challenging than I originally anticipated and it has still not progressed into a fully functional prototype. However, during the process of learning to make that pack I have designed several others including the Northern Lite. One of my major life and design philosophies is to always be learning about and from everything around me and to seek out new solutions to problems. I adamantly believe that there is always a way to do anything, it is up to me to find the way - I don’t believe in “can’t”. The Northern Lite is a great example of this philosophy. I literally worked on the lower compression system of that pack for months before finally settling on the design in use today. The lower compression straps of that pack not only compress the load in 2 places but also lift the bottom of the pack, thereby providing excellent compression and load stabilization as well as preventing the feeling of low riding that some packs have. And they do all this without interfering with the usability of the large mesh pocket. I think more than anything else this process of learning and problem solving is why I like making gear. <br /> <br />My goal for Elemental Horizons is simple: Total world domination! Seriously though, I would like to continue to make the best gear I can as long as people like what I am doing and as long as I enjoy it. I have ideas for several new packs one of which will hopefully be available later this season, this year we are launching a line of mesh bags and duffles for paddle sports, and I would like to branch out into bike touring accessories in the future as well.<br /> <br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Matthew, we love to be let in on the work-in-progress stuff! Can you let us know what kind of new products you&#8217;re working at the moment?</span><br /> <br />Well as I mentioned earlier we are launching a new line of mesh duffles and bags this season. There are 3 different sizes with varying features. Two are duffle style bags and the other is a tote style with a single strap. And of course there is the new pack. This pack is designed to be frameless, and to accept one of my aluminum frame stays. It is smaller in volume than the Northern Lite, and is designed for lighter loads. It is also significantly lighter in weight. I just sent a prototype off for testing and feedback, and already have a few tweaks in mind. My hope is to have it in limited production by mid May but we will just have to see how things go. <br /> <br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">How works the R&D at Elemental Horizons, do you have a need yourself that you try to fix, or do some of your clients inspire you for new products or ask you for solutions to their problems?</span><br /> <br />I get my inspiration from all over the place. Some products I want or need personally, others are suggested by customers, and sometimes ideas just pop into my head. The UL insulated water bottle holder is a great example of a customer suggested product. That product was suggested by the first customer to buy a Northern Lite. He needed an insulator that he could use during the day to keep his water cool in the Sierras and wanted to be able to use the same insulator to rehydrate his meals at night. We bounced ideas around for a while and I came up with a holder similar to what I sell now. It worked great for him on his High Sierras Trail hike this past fall! I love talking to other gear nuts! People who use the gear day in and day out know what works and what doesn’t and really get my creative juices flowing. Sometimes the highly specialized or specific needs of one person won’t necessarily fit the broader market, but I am more than happy to make custom gear for people.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">What is the most sold piece of gear from Elemental Horizons? Also, where do your customer come from?</span><br /> <br />I sell more accessories than the big ticket items. I sell lots of accessory pockets, water bottle holders, and hats; stuff like that. But the packs are catching on more and more and I think as I introduce more designs and people start to hear about me more my sales in other areas will increase.  I have customers all over the world. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Are you in touch with other cottage manufacturers in Europe, the USA, Canada or other places, besides AntiGravityGear with whom you cooperate very closely?</span><br /> <br />Yes, the outdoor industry is a pretty close knit group of companies especially the smaller companies. We all go to the same events and shows like Trail Days and talk gear and swap stories. Many of us use each other’s gear and love checking out the newest coolest brain storms of each other and we do occasionally work together on projects. For example last summer I made a pack for Russ over at Trail Designs that might eventually go into production. Jacks ’R Better and Trail Designs are two companies that I speak to pretty regularly. I have not yet had the opportunity to meet any of the companies from Europe or Canada but I welcome the opportunity.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/knGo1JnnViswHwIJ7Uczhw?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6Zquiq1LSI/AAAAAAAAB7g/5r0WSrS3qGc/s800/Amicalola-Falls-2010.jpg" /></a><br />Matthew at the Appalachian Trail celebration at Amicalola Falls State Park in George, where Matthew was sharing a booth with AntiGravityGear and showing his products. The gray and green pack is the new prototype design.<br /> <br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">What is your own favorite backpack, sleep system and shelter? Any other favourite piece of gear which you always carry with you?</span><br /> <br />I have to say that right now my favorite back pack is the Northern Lite. It is perfect for me right now, but I am really excited about this new pack I am working on as well. My sleep system is one area that I have been doing a lot of experimenting with recently. I have been testing out quilts and am experimenting with hammock camping some too. I have a Jacks ‘R Better quilt which I really like both on the ground and on the hammock which also is a JRB. I generally use an AntiGravityGear tarp on backpacking and bicycle touring trips and a Sierra Designs tent on paddling trips. I also really love my Caldera Ti-Tri - I just got an Inferno set to go inside and plan to use it on my next trip. <br /> <br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">When and where was your last longer backpacking trip, and what was your baseweight? Are you planning to get out for a trip soon, and enjoy the winter/ spring season?</span><br /> <br />My last longer backpacking trip was in 2008. I was supposed to hike a 5 day stretch of the John Muir Trail in California. But I blew out my knee early in the trip and had to come off the trail. My base weight for that trip was about 15 pounds. It was my first trip to the Sierras and I was not really sure what to expect - I definitely would go lighter next time. I had a trip planned for 3 weeks ago and had to reschedule due to hip issues. It is looking like now it might be May or June. But I am really looking forward to it.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/vflplsVwHWp35dfCiUWSKQ?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6ZqyuAu9xI/AAAAAAAAB7w/qEqtf2xYgDc/s800/MS-TourtoTanglewood-09.jpg" /></a><br />MS Tour to Tanglewood 09 – In September 09 Matthew participated in a Multiple Sclerosis fund raiser bike ride, where he rode 47 miles in the rain on the first day of the event. This picture was taken at the end of that first day, and the other person in the picture is his good friend and teammate Cliff Pender.<br /> <br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Do you think ultralight backpacking will become more popular and break into the mass market, or will it continue to be something for a small group of people?</span><br /> <br />I do believe that light weight backpacking will become a more mainstream facet of the sport. As with everything, I think there will always be a select few who really push the envelope of the sport and themselves by being truly ”ultra” light, but as more and more people start to use light weight techniques and gear more companies will begin to offer a wider range of products for the light weight enthusiasts. <br /> <br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Matthew, I thank you for taking the time to answer my questions. Is there something you would like to add?</span><br /> <br />I would like to thank you for inviting me to participate in this ongoing discussion. It has been my pleasure to share my thoughts and ideas with you and your readers. I am excited about the many opportunities awaiting me and my company in the future and hope to be able to be a part of this great community of outdoors people long into the future. Happy Trails!</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Five o&#8217;clock in the morning, time to get up. It is still dark outside, and I try to convince myself that I need to get out of the bed now, if I want to catch all the trains and the only bus to Repovesi national park. Coffee, smoothie, an apple and pear put into the side pocket of the <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/02/gear-talk-golite-pinnacle-2010-backpack.html">Pinnacle</a>, and off I go to the railway station, which is already busy with people. Five hours later the bus driver lets me out at the road to Lapinsalmi, the entrance of the national park. Already here there is silence, and only the occasional bird song disturbs the tranquility. Four kilometers later I stand at the entrance, a huge parking lot is witness to the masses of people which must be here in the summer and on weekends.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/asEjufPZTtTBTquaSJba9w?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjdz9m0rcGr_QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6Hgz4cGQjI/AAAAAAAAB4k/bCcy2j9PRRI/s800/P1030224.JPG" /></a><br />On the way to Lapinsalmi.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/KcFT0dipI9GCYZKZOXSvIQ?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjdz9m0rcGr_QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6HhALPQDNI/AAAAAAAAB4o/rbzpXyMFIN4/s800/P1030240.JPG" /></a><br />On top of Lapinsalmi hanging bridge.<br /><br />The trail towards Lapinsalmi hanging bridge is well worn out, testifying that the weekend must have been busy with folks - snowshoes not yet needed. The clouds disappear, I cross the bridge and go down to the hut. Lunch time, refilling water bottles in the stream, observing the woodpecker close by, enjoying the sun. <br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/YRLHqzs9ujNltcjwqPRnNA?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjdz9m0rcGr_QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6HhGe8U_5I/AAAAAAAAB4s/g9BV07fT_Nw/s800/P1030248.JPG" /></a><br />Guerilla marketing.<br /><br />As I continue, I see the tracks of the guy which got out a few kilometers before me, and follow them back to the hut. He carries a 70+ l backpack, has a Pulka with him, and is of course German. We chat a few minutes, but he ain&#8217;t too social so I continue. I follow the trail for a moment, but because it goes up and down the hills I decide to take the easy route - the frozen Katajajärvi lake. I always feel a bit uneasy on the ice, even if it is -8°C and only a few centimeters of snow cover, my concentration is on and I am listening to possible cracks. I should feel save, after all there&#8217;s a well worn ski trail, but somehow I&#8217;m not totally relaxed.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/94plntqzAG5jT14-EtA3Zw?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjdz9m0rcGr_QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6HhODbv1fI/AAAAAAAAB4w/sYwxFQidUqU/s800/P1030266.JPG" /></a><br />Leaving tracks on Katajajärvi lake.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/GlzD8GVfGkF3D57WhzlY5A?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjdz9m0rcGr_QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6HhTtGdunI/AAAAAAAAB40/kIs8tivjXso/s800/P1030271.JPG" /></a><br />View on Mustavuori hill, across the Kuutinlahti lake.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/bTq1Lic7wVxysXrcCsrdWQ?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjdz9m0rcGr_QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6HhgariWsI/AAAAAAAAB44/coxwP4mVHv0/s800/P1030295.JPG" /></a><br />Spring is in the air - most trees were already snow free.<br /><br />I walk over Kuutinlahti lake towards the hut, have a short peek inside and continue towards the Mustavuori hill. A 109 m ascent, and some folks did this without snowshoes, potholing the complete way up - in nearly a meter of snow, quite a feat. The view is worth it, though. I walk along the cliff, take in the view and spot a nice site where I&#8217;d like to pitch the tarp and start compressing the snow before I continue to the viewing tower, so it has time to settle.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/5uDbWbOAbKsz8kfB32cjQA?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjdz9m0rcGr_QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6HhyWfN9ZI/AAAAAAAAB5M/BH9k7DSrpTQ/s800/P1030316.JPG" /></a><br />View from the tower across Kuutinlahti lake and the Ruskiasalmi strait.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/8yrZsx1FdGaBmgrc5siInQ?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjdz9m0rcGr_QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6Hh79EzYVI/AAAAAAAAB5U/RV_8eqa0bsY/s800/P1030324.JPG" /></a><br />Olhavanvuori in the distance.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/0uplb1Fgiu2tm_g7VZ4sHQ?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjdz9m0rcGr_QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6HuJ8s4eYI/AAAAAAAAB68/gO7JvmNp1uo/s800/Owl_ball.jpg" /></a><br />The view tower seems to be a favourite spot of owls, as this owl pellet shows.<br /><br />Back at the designated site to pitch the tarp I am encountering a problem as I put the trekking pole in the snow - another 90 cm of snow till the bottom. I wonder, should I dig a snow cave, bivy under the clear sky or go down to the hut? After a while of wrestling with my own comfort zone, I decide to take the easy way out, and descent down towards the hut. <br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/ct7Em_WSk1UMNdJ8olVViA?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjdz9m0rcGr_QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6HpsLDLsFI/AAAAAAAAB5Y/rk4xDZAYXiA/s800/P1030334.JPG" /></a><br />Deep snow.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/jGz66bTxQfdMFriZ8kusEw?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjdz9m0rcGr_QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6HpzNT9sFI/AAAAAAAAB5g/N_RZhpoIDDE/s800/P1030354.JPG" /></a><br />Dusk ain&#8217;t too bad from down here.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/40BNDs_wFFZxcX8hGLTEXA?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjdz9m0rcGr_QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6Hqdl13wnI/AAAAAAAAB58/hZePGl4cllw/s800/P1030372.JPG" /></a><br />The comfort zone.<br /><br />The fire is going, sausages are barbecued, I sawed plenty of wood for the night, and enjoy the clear sky with its millions of stars. The ice is cracking, an owl is hooting, and I roll out the sleeping bag and mats, boil water for the night bouillon and tuck myself in. A fine night, waking up every once in a while to throw more wood on the fire, and relaxed I wake up at seven the next morning. The fire is still going, and I heat up the rest of the bouillon for breakfast, pack up and start walking again.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/NTAvid7hq_644Pf-7bqquA?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjdz9m0rcGr_QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6HqnB9sMtI/AAAAAAAAB6A/3pUtWZKfwcA/s800/P1030386.JPG" /></a><br />The collapsed cliffs at Kuutinkanava, an amazing acoustic here, no wonder they have concerts here in the summers.<br /><br />I head towards Kuutinkanava over the lake, enjoy the echo, have a look at the old log flute and continue through the forest towards the Katajajärvi fire site and onwards towards Kapiavesi fire site. Passing over the ice towards the Lapinsalmi entrance, I see the German&#8217;s red pulka in the distance at the Lapinsalmi hut - apparently he didn&#8217;t venture further and stayed there for the night. The four kilometers towards the main road are walked quickly, and ten minutes later I was able to hitch a ride to Kouvola.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/w4rKSZUDOwB-0xttrm339Q?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjdz9m0rcGr_QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6HqvqvPPgI/AAAAAAAAB6E/qRiUYLH_wfk/s800/P1030397.JPG" /></a><br />Mouse tracks in the snow.<br /><br />It were two beautiful days out. I am a bit disappointed with myself that I didn&#8217;t succeed in wildcamping on top of Mustavuori, I reckon the sunset and dawn would have been very impressive from up there - the next time then. Too bad I also only had two days time, there would have been more hills to climb and sights to see, and at the moment it is perfect to navigate there, as you can use the frozen lakes, which is a lot easier than scrambling through the forest. I hope to return there while the lakes are frozen and the snow is covering the land, it is a beautiful national park and not many people are around. Anyone want to go for a weekend?<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/C5Z96XIy_I9o_5tNjMl1GA?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjdz9m0rcGr_QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6Hq1YDhGgI/AAAAAAAAB6I/jTTxvSL_yco/s800/P1030412.JPG" /></a></div>

The next installments of interviews with cottages manufacturers, this time with a company who&#8217;s product lets you take smart and great photos of yourself - <a href="http://www.thestickpic.com/">TheStickPic.com</a>. Rod Java came out of his secret laboratory to tell us where their company is headed, which none-photographic products we can expect from them in the future and what kind of process it is to start up a cottage manufacturing business. This one is definitely going to make you smile and brighten up your day, so enjoy!<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/3zivdr2Qa0pz2qkzNQA-ug?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S50tUEDa7HI/AAAAAAAAB2w/Zymsju9_oGY/s800/IMG_4301.jpg" /></a><br />StickPic partners and good hiking friends David Lopez (left) and Rodney Java.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Rod, please briefly introduce yourself and tell us who you are. How often are you out backpacking nowadays?</span><br /><br />Hello. I’m Rod Java, the kooky inventor of the StickPic. My good friend and hiking partner, David Lopez, and I are business partners and came up with the name, &#8220;TheStickPic.com&#8221;. I should also mention that behind every great husband entrepreneur is a great wife. And behind me is my wife Sylvia. For all those single ladies out there, David is single too! While David handles all the books, I stay hidden deep down in my secret laboratory inventing new hiking gadgets.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Since when are you backpacking, and how did you start?</span><br /><br />I’m a self taught backpacker. My parents emigrated from the Philippines in 1950 and never ventured into the wilderness. I’m sure it was their fear of all the lions, tigers and bears that would eat you up once you stepped into the forest. I, on the other hand, grew up street wise and knew better. There are no lions or tigers in California, only bears like Yogi Bear in the cartoons. And nobody should be afraid of Yogi Bear, right? Anyway, I’ve been hiking in the California Sierras since 1974.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">How often are you out backpacking nowadays?</span><br /><br />Since I’m also a Sierra Club backpack section leader, I hike about 30 days each year. It’s great that I can claim every trip as a business expense since I am always asked to demonstrate and explain the StickPic to everybody that sees me using it.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Are you a lightweight/ UL backpacker? If so, what is your typical baseweight?</span><br /><br />In 1974 I definitely started out “old school” wearing Levi pants, bulky construction boots, and a 60 pound backpack. These days, I have adopted the Ultra Lightweight philosophy and lifestyle. Because I hike primarily in areas where a bear canister is required, my base weight is a little different from others. For most hikes I can get below 15 pounds base weight including an Expedition size Bearikade bear canister. <br /><br />I can get my weight down low because I make my own custom external framed backpack frames from carbon fiber and have a unique way to carry all my gear without a traditional pack bag. It’s a concept I invented which I&#8217;m always developing.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">TheStickPic.com makes the very innovative Stick Pic, which is now in its second reincarnation and is a perfect way to photograph yourself in a decent manner. Can you tell us how you came up with the idea, how you went about manufacturing it, and decided to start the company?</span><br /><br />This is a great question. Since I like to hike solo, it was a no brainer to come up with the StickPic idea. On most of my early solo hikes, I would snap lot pictures of all the beautiful sights I came across. When I would show them to my friends, they would all ask questions like, “Where are you in the picture?” or, “OK, Rod, sure you made it to the top of Mt Whitney……How about showing me some proof???? Like a picture of you on top of Mt. Whitney!” As you can tell from the questions, some of my friends like to kid around with me. <br /><br />Since my arms are too short to take a good self portrait, I thought, “There has to be a better way!” This is when the light bulb on top of my head can be seen. What if I attached my camera to the end of my trekking pole, set the timer and take a self portrait? Would it work? Will my camera come off and fall off down a 13,000 foot mountain? Will I look weird if somebody saw me doing this? Will my friends believe me now, even if I have proof?<br /><br />Needless to say, I took all those chances and followed my heart. I was ridiculed by many a hiker. I would hear them say, “It will never work!”&#8230;“You look very silly doing that!”&#8230; “You are wasting your time!”&#8230; “The world is flat and you will sail over the edge!”&#8230;<br /><br />Really, I never did hear those things. But those were some of the things going through my head at the time. I actually was given a lot of support and encouragement from everybody to pursue my dream of making a better life for solo backpackers.<br /><br />Since I am a home shop machinist, I have a complete machine shop in my garage and was able to experiment with many different materials and designs. I initially made all the StickPics one by one then decided to contract the work to a small machine shop. This way all the StickPics were made with consistent results.<br /><br />From the moment my first prototype was tested in the Sierras, hikers wanted to know where I got it and where they can buy one too. My thoughts were, “You mean you want to pay me to make you one?” <br /><br />Now I have to admit, that when David and I decided to make a business of selling the StickPic, I was dreaming of driving a new car, buying a new home, a boat, and finally able to afford the unobtainable Gossamer Gear Lightrex trekking poles. But first I had to enlist the help of the most credible, honest, reliable, believable, dependable people on the face of this planet; the PCT thru hiker. It’s the Pacific Crest Trail thru hiker who will examine every piece of gear in their pack, count every gram and only take what is required to survive and live on the trail for the next 5 to 6 months.<br /><br />Just a few weeks before the ADZPCTKO in April 2008, I contacted the organizers of this great event for their permission to give away, that’s right, give away our first prototype of the StickPic to every single 2008 PCT thru hiker who was brave enough to want and try one out. In exchange for the free StickPic we only asked for their honest feedback, comments, and suggestions to make the StickPic better. We made a promise to listen to what they had to say and act on their feedback.  <br /><br />In 2008, 150 thru hikers started their 2600 mile journey with our beta StickPic in their pockets. We kept our fingers and toes crossed for weeks and months hoping that these thru hikers would keep their promise and contact us with their honest comments. And without a doubt the comments and suggestions came trickling in. And as promised, we took their comments and suggestions seriously and immediately began a series of improvements based on their suggestions. In 2009 we were invited back to the ADZPCTKO as official vendors and sold a whole bunch more StickPics to the &#8216;09 thru hikers. <br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/o5a-YtjgsXIkHaEmf-I53w?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S50tTe8bX2I/AAAAAAAAB2s/xZKPlWD-j2o/s800/pic%20%2875%29.JPG" /></a><br />Rod demonstrating and giving away the first prototype StickPic to all 2008 PCT thru hikers.<br /><br />We continued to make improvements throughout 2009 and now in 2010, we have what we think is the final version of the StickPic. Our eternal gratitude goes out to the organizers of the ADZPCTKO who gave us our chance as a cottage industry gear manufacturer and to the hundreds of PCT thru hikers who helped us out.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Rod, we love to be let in on the work-in-progress stuff! Can you let us know if you&#8217;re working on any new products or a new version of the Stick Pic at the moment?</span><br /><br />As far as the StickPic, we want to get the StickPic used on top of the highest peaks in the world. That includes Mt. Everest! We are currently working with a few high altitude mountain climbers who will test the StickPic in severe snow conditions and let us know how we can develop a StickPic for these conditions. If you know of anybody that can also help us out, please put them in contact with us. We would love to work with them too. Besides a free StickPic, they can claim to be the first ever to take a StickPic self portrait on top of the world!<br /><br />I personally, have 2 projects that I am working on which will someday be sold at our website. The first is my revolutionary method of carrying all my gear without a bag and while strapping a bear canister on my back. Secondly, is a retractable sun/snow/rain shade that attaches to my custom external pack frames which I named the SierraShade. I also am working on a universal SierraShade that will easily adapt to most internal framed packs. <br /><br />If you ever hiked in the desert when the temperatures are above 110 degrees or hiked above tree line where there is no shade in sight, you will know why I invented the SierraShade aka SaharaShade. Maybe later in the year I can share with you and your readers more about these projects. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">What is the most sold Stick Pic, version one or two? Also, where do your customer come from?</span><br /><br />Our #2 StickPic is our best seller because it fits 75% of all trekking poles including all Leki sticks. The #3 & #5 StickPics fit the popular Black Diamond sticks and is our 2nd most sold model number. We are fortunate to have customers from all around the world including, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, UK, Germany, France, Sweden, Switzerland and of course Finland.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Are you in touch with other cottage manufacturers in Europe, the USA, Canada or other places?</span><br /><br />Becoming a small cottage manufacturer is a very slow process. You first have to work real hard to develop a great product then work even harder to make sure all your customers are happy with the product and customer service.<br /><br />Once this is accomplished, your customers will start talking positively about you and your product and the good word starts to spread like wildfire on the internet. This is when other cottage manufacturers will notice you and respect you for your efforts. You then have to establish yourself as somebody who is going to be around for a while rather than open and close, fly by night operation.<br /><br />I don’t mean to be a name dropper, but it’s taken almost 3 years before I could rub shoulders with the great cottage pioneers like Glen Van Peski from Gossamer Gear, Brian Frankle from ULA and Lee, Rand and Russ from Trail Designs. <br /><br />As the StickPic becomes a more familiar name on the trail and in the outdoor industry, we plan to align ourselves with more cottage industry manufactures. But for now, we like to take it slow and one step at a time.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">What is your own favorite backpack, sleep system, shelter and camera? Any other favourite piece of gear which you always carry with you?</span><br /><br />If I’m not using my custom made external frame setup, I like to use my Golite Jam pack. I hope to one day have a Gossamer Gear Gorilla pack or a ULA Circuit pack. All of which will have my SierraShade mounted to them!<br /><br />As far as shelters, I have a few tents, but I always seem to take my Big Agness UL Seedhouse 2 on most trips. I know, I know, it’s not ultra light. At 3 pounds, it’s the lightest 2 person, free standing tent that I know is bombproof. I have been in extreme rain and wind conditions and this tent never failed me. I like to keep all my gear inside my tent at night and enjoy the extra space in my tent when stuck in the tent for 10-12 hour straight. <br /><br />My favorite compact camera is the Samsung DualView TL225 12.2 MP digital camera. It’s perfect for taking shots with the StickPic because it has a viewfinder in the front as well as in the back of the camera. I wish I invented this camera! One of my favorite pieces of gear is the AuqaStar Plus UV water treatment device. I had to modify it to suit my needs by drilling a hole in the bottle and inserting a short water tube with a bite valve at the end. This way I don’t have to remove the UV element every time I need to take a drink as the manufacturer recommends. In my opinion this is a fault in their design. This is a great lightweight water filter if you know how to use it correctly.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">When and where was your last longer backpacking trip, and what was your baseweight? Are you planning to get out for a trip soon, and enjoy the winter/ spring season?</span><br /><br />My longest trip was in 2006 when I solo hiked the JMT southbound in 15 days. My step off weight, including water and food for 9 days, was only 28 pounds. This included my 3 pound Berikade Expedition model bear canister. In the Summer of 2010 I hope to again hike the JMT, but this time Northbound. This all depends if I have been good around the house and my wife gives me her blessing. Only the married guys out there will know what I’m talking about.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/67hBdtGzGLtkFmmlL7YoAw?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S50tUnne04I/AAAAAAAAB20/FoITaY1Ri6Q/s800/IMG_4398.jpg" /></a><br />Rod taking a group shot on a Sierra Club backpacking trip.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Do you think ultralight backpacking will become more popular and break into the mass market, or will it continue to be something for a small group of people?</span><br /><br />I recently noticed at many of the outdoor stores, that the really large packs of 6000 – 7000 ci are rarely sold. More common are the smaller packs around 3000-4000 ci. So I think the big companies like Northface, REI, Gregory and Osprey realize that backpacking with a 60 pound pack is a thing of the past and want to align their other lightweight products like tents and sleeping bags with their lightweight packs. This is only my theory and I’m sticking to it.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Rod, I thank you for taking the time to answer my questions. Is there something you would like to add?</span><br /><br />I just want mention how honored I am to be considered worthy of your time for this interview. It tells me that we are heading in the right direction as far as developing a product that works and is considered a valuable piece of gear for many hikers. It also shows me that the way we treat our customers is really paying off. Thank you again for this wonderful experience and have a great day!</div>
