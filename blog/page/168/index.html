  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I am interviewing Jan Betros from Sweden, Founder of Röjk. &lt;a href=”http://rojk.se/”target=”_blank”&gt;Röjk&lt;/a&gt; is a young company which makes garments that are very functional, stylish and have proper ethical and sustainable credentials. In this interview Jan highlights how he started the company, the ideas that drive his designs and what we can expect in the future from Röjk! <br /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7202349350/" title="Me hiking Yellow mountains in China by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7238/7202349350_19f93ff2d7_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Me hiking Yellow mountains in China" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Jan, please briefly introduce yourself and tell us who you are. Since when are you backpacking &amp; bikepacking, and how did you start?</strong><br />
I am rased and born in Stockholm near the archipelagos, mountains, sea and nature was always close. I spent my youth as a professional gymnast and finally when I was 21 I moved to Annecy in the French Alps to spend time for hiking, skiing, rock climbing and cycling. For five years I was backpacking and skiing around the world and earned my living by working in ski- and mountainshops. My interest for making innovative sportswear grew and finally I started my studies at University of Derby with Performance Sportswear Design. With the help of my seamstress grandmother in Sweden I made my first prototype of the Tvister Helmet Hood who in 2007 won the Innovation For Extremes Prize for best design and innovation. After the award I got a lot of publicity and the brand RÖJK SUPERWEAR was introduced to the market in fall 2009.<br /></p>

<p><strong>How often are you outdoors hiking, skiing or backpacking nowadays?</strong><br />
Unfortunately not as often as I used to, but at least I get to make awesome gear for everyone who spends time in the outdoors :)<br /></p>

<p><strong>Are you more of a “weekend hiker” or do you have some long distance trips under your belt?</strong><br />
Nowadays I am more of a weekend hiker because of a lot of work but I always plan at least one or two long backpacking trips every year.<br /></p>

<p><strong>Which category would you put yourself in: SUL, UL, Lightweight or Bushcraft</strong>? What is your typical baseweight?**<br />
Well as weekend hiker I hike rather light, average is around 30 - 45 liters but for my backpacking trips where I am aways for at least 2 or 3 month I carry 60-70 liters.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7202350426/" title="The Röjk Superwear base.2 by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7096/7202350426_ecc38ed75c_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="The Röjk Superwear base.2" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Please tell us where the name “Röjk” came from, and what it stands for.</strong><br />
RÖJK is a shortage for RÖJÅK which is an expression for the PERFECT RIDE. It’s all about the perfect ride and making things perfect :)<br /></p>

<p><strong>Röjk designs functional garments, which are Made in Portugal &amp; Sweden. Can you tell us how the idea to start the company emerged and how you see its future?</strong>
Röjk makes innovative and attractive garments. We make all our garments in Portugal, all beanies and socks in Sweden. The idea for Röjk is to make garments that look good, with versatile use. For example our Helmet Hood can be used for running, skiing, hiking and cycling. Our liner socks can be used for hiking, skiing, running, cycling and with jeans or a suit instead of a cotton sock! We will continue so make more versatile garments mainly for the average people, backpackers and for everyone who likes to spend time int the outdoors. Garments will include running, light hiking, cycling, yoga, backpacking, travelling, surfing, and for everyone who enjoys the good things in life :)</p>

<p><strong>What makes Röjk different from other outdoor companies?</strong>
Well many things actually, first of all we are a small and independent company and they are big companies! We are focusing on the average person who is not particularly a top athlete but who likes adventures and sports but wants something that is of great quality and good looking as well. The old and big outdoor brands are focusing on the hardcore user and uses the term “Outdoor” but for us we are the new and next generation and we are focusing on “what is now” and we rather use the term Backpacker and Adventurer. I try to find gaps rather than making things that already exists.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7202348814/" title="Me backpacking in Portugal by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7090/7202348814_8c7632b54d_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" alt="Me backpacking in Portugal" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Your company makes its garments in Europe, and uses recyclable materials, so does pretty well in environmental terms. What brought this decision on?</strong>
Well I thought that if I want to make garments that are suitable for spending most time in nature then of course I should try to be nice to nature. Simple as that :)</p>

<p><strong>Röjk is starting to get more exposure in outdoor blogs lately; how about magazines, are they featuring your goods?</strong> 
We have only been on the market for 3 years and things are going fast. We have not been active with making press releases etc. - mostly because we wanted to make the company grow a little bit by itself. Now and then we can see our stuff in both national and international magazines, it’s great that they chose our stuff and to write good things about us. </p>

<p>**Can you tell us a bit how you went about the design process of the Tvister Hoody, and where the inspiration came from? **
I wanted to develop the ultimate and versatile hoody of all time, something that no one else had made and so simply that it would make the big brands wonder why they never thought of that, and so I did :). I started to put on many different layers of tops from layer 1 to layer 3 and eliminated everything that was uncomfortable such as zips, pockets, seams on wrong places and finally I narrowed it down to what i need and do not need in my hoody. Finally the design of the garment had tvisted arms, a balaclava shaped hood that can be used under a helmet and thereof the name. When I was done with the construction I thought I would make the design different and something that everyone can recognize and I made the asymmetrical colors.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7202348268/" title="bild by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7226/7202348268_15a54a074f_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="bild" /></a></p>

<p><strong>You use a lot of bright colours in your garments, and aren’t afraid to mix it up. This and your garments asymmetric seams make Röjk garments stand out. Are you do this to simply differentiate yourself, or what’s the story behind these?</strong><br />
Well at first I understood that I have to stand out and I wanted people to see what a Röjk garment is without having to see the name. I thought that why would the shops want to buy Röjk if it looks like everything else so I would be more safe by standing out rather than not standing out. And in the end of the day I want to make garments that I like to wear :)<br /></p>

<p><strong>Jan, we love to be let in on the work-in-progress stuff! Can you let us know what kind of new products you’re working on at the moment?</strong><br />
Well, we are developing our first spring/ summer range that will be on the markets spring 2014 which will include bikewear, running and backpacking. And for next fall we have developed some cool compression garments and more hoodys and T-shirts in merino wool, I love hoodys and t-shirts and can’t have enough of them :)<br /></p>

<p><strong>Any new lightweight materials that have you all excited?</strong><br />
There’s so many but I am working really close with PrimaLoft right now to develop a lightweight range in PrimaLoft.<br /></p>

<p><strong>How works the R&amp;D at Röjk, do you have a need yourself that you try to fix, or do some of your clients inspire you for new products and ask you for solutions to their problems?</strong><br />
So far it has been mostly me finding new solutions but as we grow we are getting a lot of feedback and many requests. We also have our friends who we call “Superheros”, they are professional athletes who can test our garments and new developments on an intense way and give us a great feedback. <br /></p>

<p><strong>Where do your customer come from?</strong><br />
Tricky question, it varies a lot but mostly from they’re adventurers, backpackers and the average person who is off for a short trip and wants something really good &amp; attractive!<br /></p>

<p><strong>Do you think the lightweight backpacking principles will become more popular and break into the mass market, or will it continue to be something for a small group of people?</strong><br />
I think it is growing and more people are asking for it, however I think that the demand is higher than the supply.<br /></p>

<p><strong>Are you in touch with other smaller manufacturers in Europe, the USA, Japan, and other places?</strong><br />
Not really as we have not had the time really to focus on others but we have plans on working more close with other small manufacturers.<br /></p>

<p><strong>What is your own favorite backpack, sleep system and shelter?</strong><br />
I just bought an OSPREY Exos 58 wich will be perfect for my shorter trips, I have a Hilleberg Nallo 2 GT and Thermarest NeoAir Xlite. I have so much gear for different occasions.<br /></p>

<p><strong>Any other favourite piece of gear which you always carry with you?</strong><br />
I’m a bit of a gear-nerd and I have many bit’s and pieces :)<br /></p>

<p><strong>When and where was your last backpacking/ skiing/ bikepacking trip?</strong><br />
This March I went with a friend to Switzerland for one week to ski. It was great, we stayed in a French town called Bulle and everyday we went to a new place to ski. Last summer I went to Australia for three months. First I went skiing for 2 months in the snowy mountains of NSW and then went off backpacking and rock climbing for a month. I also have a big crush on Portugal and I go there at least five times every year mainly for the manufacturing of our great garments and while I’m there I go for backpacking, surfing, rock climbing and I enjoy the nice wine :) <br /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7202349898/" title="The Röjk Superwear base.1 by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5231/7202349898_ce0766dfe6_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="The Röjk Superwear base.1" /></a></p>

<p><strong>And where is your dream backpacking/ skiing/ bikepacking trip taking you?</strong><br />
I really need to go back to New Zeeland and see all of it. I plan to go to Patagonia this fall to go rock climbing and I want to ski in Japan, damn so many places I still need to explore and lets not forget about Finland, I need to see more of Finland as well.<br /></p>

<p><strong>Are you planning to get out for a trip soon, and enjoy the Swedish spring?</strong><br />
Yes, me and my girlfriend are first going hiking Kungsleden in the north of Sweden for a week, then I’m going with some friends to Riksgränsen to celebrate Swedish midsummer and do some late spring skiing. We are also going to Portugal for two months to do some backpacking, surfing and take a language course in Portuguese. Besides from these plans I always have many spontaneous trips going, live is good :)<br /></p>

<p><strong>Jan, I thank you very mucho for taking the time to answer my questions =) Is there something you would like to add?</strong><br />
Thank you and I’m glad you like what we are doing and dont forget to &lt;a href=”http://www.facebook.com/pages/R%C3%B6jk-Superwear-AB/230356607022905”target=”_blank”&gt;LIKE us on Facebook&lt;/a&gt; to keep up on what we are doing next and spread the word about us :)<br /></p>

<br>The Snowspeeders landed at dusk on Hoth. Four UL conscripts, arriving from warm, sun-spoiled Tatooine to train in their fight against the heavyweight backpackers, embarked from the Snowspeeders, on their backs light packs, filled with the finest equipment to survive in the demading environment of Hoth. While the hanger crew took care of the Snowspeeders the conscripts walked over to the baracks, where beds and showers were waiting for them. As Commander Hesse walked in to inspect & interview them, he found them sorting through their kit, full of questions for the coming training in the ice & snow desert. How much insulation clothing would be needed, what is the weather forecast, where to deposit for not-needed gear during the exercise. Hesse answered their questions, and after the conscripts were done packing the group went to a local food parlour, where they discussed the plans for the coming exercise. Relaxed and full from good food, the group dispersed and retired to their beds, mentally prepared for what lay ahead.<br>
<br>
The next day the sun rose in the East, bathing Hoth in a warm glow. Last supplies were gathered by the group, before they and Commander Hesse boarded a transport ship which brought them to the outpost of Ruovesi. The weather was changing, from sunny to snowing and cloudy, but by the time the group disembarked from the transport ship the sun was dominating the sky. The five saddled their backpacks, with skis and snowshoes attached, and set out towards the end of the village. Ruovesi being a small outpost, the group soon walked on the prepared skiing track leading into the wild, and Commander Hesse put on his skis while conscript Fliegengewicht got his UL Pulka out and ready.</br>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/6993030521/" title="Over a field by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7038/6993030521_827da832cc_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="Over a field"></a>

<br>While the Commander skied ahead of the group, the four conscripts made good speed on the well frozen path, and the first few kilometers were quickly behind our group. The plan included following the skiing track for a while, until crossing over to a road and walk till the beginning of the training area. The conscripts put on their snowshoes to cross a field; without they sunk in until their thighs, with snowshoes only ankle to knee-deep. Hesse sped over the field, before taking his skis off and leading the way along the road till the training area was reached.<br>

<br>A first small break was enjoyed, food and water was shared, before the group entered the forest and climbed up the ridge. While Hesse was leading on the open fields and forest, climbing the steep ridges with his skis was suboptimal and he fell behind the conscripts with their snowshoes, easily traversing the terrain. Once again down on the other side of the ridge however, Hesse was again leading the pack. With skeptical looks the conscripts observed how the Commander skied onto the lake, reassuring them that it was safe. Carefully, close to the shore, the conscripts set foot on the ice, thankful that it carried well and offering a vastly superior walking experience to the deep snow in the forests.<br>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/6993041929/" title="In the shadows by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7181/6993041929_cf97ea210b_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="In the shadows"></a>

<br>Strong winds opposed our little group, with wind speeds of over 15 m/s howling over the smooth, frozen lakes, transforming the mild temperatures of -2°C into body-numbing -22°C. Every possibility for a sheltered advance were taken, and breaks to snack and drink, to keep the energy up, kept the mood of the group high. So the two lakes were traversed without incidents and good speed was made, and the benefits of light gear became apparent.<br>
<br>
At the end of the lakes, the group followed a small stream to the higher up lake, where camp should be made. The low sun was making the shadows on Hoth long, and the temperature fell a little, though it was felt by our group, which by now started to get tired. This tiredness became apparent when two of the conscripts broke through the ice on the river, and got wet feet. Thus our group increased the speed, despite tiredness, and soon came to the end of the small stream, where they found open water flanked by cliffs on both sides blocking their advance. The conscripts had again an advantage in climbing up the steep ridge, while Commander Hesse took off his skis and climbed, knee-deep in the snow, the ridge up. Up on top, the sun had set in the west by now, basking the lakes and forests in a warm, orange glow while from east a deep blue crept over the horizon. How to proceed: Camp on top of this hill, or advance further down to the lake and the cooking shelter not far from here? The possibilities were discussed, and the shelter and fireplace swayed the group to press onward.<br>

<br>After the descent the group followed the forest road to the cooking shelter, which was only a short walk away. Quickly fires were started, a Shangria-La 4 was used to close down one of the open sides, and sleeping places were claimed. After food and warm drinks were consumed, our little group stood under the starry sky, admiring Venus, Jupiter and the Milky Way, while faint Nordic Lights danced through the sky.<br>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/6993051489/" title="Fire by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7046/6993051489_05478b8d23_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="Fire"></a>

<br>The next morning the sun returned in the east of Hoth, bathing it in its warm, bright light. Stoves were lit, and snow for the day ahead was melted, while quilts were hung up to air and packs made ready. The shadows of the forests became shorter as the sun rose over the lakes, and at the tenth hour of the day, after a small warm-up, our group left the cooking shelter and headed further north over the ice of the lake. They followed the tracks of a wolf, who traveled along the shore, while lynx and hare tracks crossed the lake. It didn&#8217;t take our group long to reach another camping site, and a decision to ski and walk to a nearby road was made.<br>

<br>Passing by a farm, the group was surprised to see two Ostriches and a party of Wild Boars, animals not native to Hoth. They continued their walk down towards where a narrow path went off into the forest again, and weren&#8217;t stopped by fallen trees in their way. The sun continued to shine down on them, and by the time they arrived at the hut of Helvetinkolu, they were able to enjoy the warmth in only their baselayers outside.<br>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7108813079/" title="Hindernis by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7063/7108813079_87e4ee569a_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="Hindernis"></a>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/6846937886/" title="Hut at Helvetinkolu by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7062/6846937886_a08907ae03_c.jpg" width="800" height="531" alt="Hut at Helvetinkolu"></a>

<br>Inside discussions were held about how to proceed: Stay at this wonderful hut for the night and explore the surroundings, or move on towards a fine camping spot a half days travel from here. Looking at the distance to be covered in total, the group broke camp in the early noon, to traverse by map and compass the terrain between the hut and the lake, at whose shore their camping spot lay.<br>

<br>Our group skied and snowshoed through forests, crossed swamps and climbed further steep ridges, and showed immense team spirit during the day. So was Commander Hesse skiing first over the swamp, encouraging the conscripts onwards, despite their sinking in to the knees in the snow; while the conscripts helped Hesse carry his skis when they climbed the ridges, in which Hesse sank in to his knees and further. Only because of this team work the group arrived after mere hours at the shore of the lake, which would take them to their camping spot.<br>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7108815593/" title="Over swamps by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7073/7108815593_95af83f2f9_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="Over swamps"></a>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/6993063107/" title="Almost there by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7045/6993063107_8688d41dc7_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="Almost there"></a>

<br>They pressed onwards, still under the warm glow of the sun, the light reflecting from the ice and snow on the lake, and reached in the early afternoon the camping spot. Again they decided to sleep in the cooking shelter, though Hesse insisted on them pitching their shelters on the lake for practice. And so three lightweight shelters sprung up on the ice, and the group inspected the different shelters: A LAUFBURSCHE Laavu, a LOCUS GEAR Khufu Sil and an GoLite Shangria-La 4. As quickly as they were pitched they disappeared again in their stuff sacks, and the group started to melt snow and prepare for the night.<br>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/6962741374/" title="Pitching exercise by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7223/6962741374_3b222e9516_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="Pitching exercise"></a>

<br>Laughter and conversation started to erupt from the cooking shelter, while tasty meals were prepared and consumed and small bottles of fine beverages were passed around. As night fell, the sounds of owls sounded through the forest, and the greatness and magnificence of our galaxy, suspend over our heads, so clearly to be seen while standing on the lake, was evident. Somewhere out there, heavyweight backpackers under the the command of Darth Heavy planned for the destruction of lightweight. Little do they know that we are prepared, and that the force is strong in us.<br>

<br>At dawn Commander Hesse awoke, skinning himself out of his quilt and bivy to enjoy the fresh, cold morning air down on the lake. The sun was illuminating the trees on the opposite shore, while male Black Grouse were on the ice, their songs being heard far and wide. Today the group would train to navigate the forest roads to reach their destination of the night, a Laavu south of their current position. One of the conscripts joined Hesse on the lake, and when they walked back up to the shelter the others were already busy making breakfast and packing.<br>

<br>The conscripts, in light of the terrain to be travelled across, opted to strap their snowshoes to their packs, while Commander Hesse preferred to ski on the ice and little snow of the forest roads. While this gave him a slight benefit in terms of speed, it was more a decision to not needing to carry the unwieldy skis and boots on his pack.<br>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/6993101299/" title="Splendid skiing conditions by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7038/6993101299_43d390d330_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="Splendid skiing conditions"></a>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/6962818660/" title="Lunch break by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7224/6962818660_8f6bcaebdc_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Lunch break"></a>

<br>The group made good speed on the forest roads, as lunchtime approached quickly. Here some differences became apparent: while the conscripts preferred to rely for energy on snacks throughout the day, Hesse liked a warm lunch in the cold weather, including melting snow for a warm cup of tea. So lunch breaks were a relaxed moment of interruption, to stretch muscles and talk. Once everyone was fed and ready, the group continued their journey south.<br>

<br>After a while they left the well maintained forest roads and continued on the track of a snowmobil through the forest, passing by summer houses and hunting towers until they came upon the Pirkan-Taival trail, running from the Ruovesi Outpost to the Kuru Outpost. Along this trail lay their goal, the Kivikieringan Laavu, perched atop a small cliff, overlooking a tiny valley and the forest. The group split apart, with everyone walking and skiing at their own speed, and so Hesse and conscript Fliegengewicht were the first ones to arrive at the lean-to shelter. Conscript Fliegengewicht quickly gathered wood and started to split it for his fine wood stove, while slowly the rest of the group arrived.<br>

<br>Sleeping places in the laavu were claimed, wood for the group fire carried from the wood shed, trails to the other buildings were established in the snow, and the benches around the hut were dug out. While it was still early, the blue sky had given way to a grey overcast heaven, with mist hanging in the air. So the group huddled around the fire, napped in their quilts and ate, until it was time to lay down for the night.<br>

<br>On the morning of the fourth day of the exercise, Hesse would leave the group to return to the HQ, and to see if the group, now equipped with the skills and knowledge to navigate & survive in the environment of Hoth, would be ready for the war. Snow for the day ahead was melted, while sleeping gear disappeared in backpacks, and coffee & müslis were consumed. At nine in the morning, with heavy mist in the air, under a grey sky, Commander Hesse gave final instructions to the conscripts, and told them that he expects to seem them the next evening back at HQ. So the group parted ways - Hesse skied back to the Ruovesi Outpost, while the conscripts snowshoed onwards to the Outpost of Kuru.<br>

<br>Commander Hesse skied like the wind, and after just 180 minutes entered the Outpost, 15 km from where he left the laavu in the morning. The personnel there was clearly surprised to see him so early, and needed some time to organize a transport ship for him back to Tampere. So he whiled away the time in the outpost, checking via satcom with the conscripts what the situation was like, and consumed coffee and cake till the transport ship finally landed. While he boarded the ship, he thought back with a smile to the past days, and that the force will be with the Ultralighters in the coming war.<br>
