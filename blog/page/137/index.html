  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
As you likely have noticed, the amount of posts has gone down a bit in the last months. Reason is simply that my business takes a lot of time at the moment, and with upcoming life changes in August time will be even more limited. Time to sit back, and outline what will happen here over the next months.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/HtmlVtopPR4tRLTKaaeGrA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S-A3_s5_ZYI/AAAAAAAACYs/6tWJgbFsb3E/s800/P1040476.jpg" /></a><br /><br />First and foremost, I will start an education to become a <span style="font-weight:bold;">wilderness guide</span> in mid-August. It is a ten months, full-time education and besides learning in the classroom expeditions are part of the curriculum. A two week autumn expedition to north-eastern Russia, a two week solo skiing expedition in Lapland in winter, a canoe expedition and other trips will certainly teach me new skills and make a superb basis to show how far ultralight gear can go. I aim to use UL gear for this education, and show that one doesn&#8217;t need 80l backpacks and bombproof gear. Also, I will be running <a href="http://www.korpiconsulting.com">my company</a> at the same time, so I will be very busy and might not always find the time to write interesting and exciting posts. The aim with this course is to have the skills, knowledge and legal requirements to offer [UL] courses in the future - but that is so far off that I will tell about this at another time!<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Ultralight from A - Z</span> is a new video series I am working on. In this 26 part series I am going to explain Ultralight backpacking from A to Z in a video for each letter, from skills to gear and philosophy I am hoping to explain ultralight backpacking it in an easy and understandable manner. It will start in the autumn, so stay tuned!<br /><br />In the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Gear Reviews</span> department I have a steady pipeline of new and exciting gear to test and tell you about. I hope to be able to write a gear article a week, it is just about finding the time.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Trip Reports</span> are still what I love best, and I aim to tell and show you more about the beautiful Finnish landscapes which I enjoy so much. The expeditions will be covered as well, so there should be a few very interesting reports coming up.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Advertising</span>. You might have seen the box on the right, this is an experiment I am trying at the moment - I saw it on <a href="http://sectionhiker.com/">sectionhiker</a>&#8217;s blog and decided to try it out myself. It helps to pay for trips & running the website, but will have no influence on the content. If I find it doesn&#8217;t work or is not worth the trouble, I will remove it. Also the <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/p/about-faq.html">Donate button on the About page</a> is there for the same idea - content will remain free, but for those who would like to give there is now the opportunity.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Interviews</span>. With already <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/p/interviews.html">23 interviews</a> on this site one might think I ran out of interesting people to talk to. Well, that is not the case and I have over half a dozen interviews in the pipeline at the moment, so that is a good reason to become a Follower or subscribe to the RSS feed to stay tuned and up-to-date!<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/mMJ1RO_t9OWn_6Ybb3m3Zw?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S-A38jmuKPI/AAAAAAAACYo/2jVIXNz9kGY/s800/P1040474.jpg" /></a><br /><br />That are my plans for the near future. I would like to thank you all for reading and commenting, it is very rewarding to see that so much people enjoy the site, it keeps me motivated to produce top-notch content. I am looking forward to you questions, comments and observations =)

Finland is experience a real heatwave at the moment, we reach temperatures of close to 30°C during the day and I somehow am happy that I can work at home in the shadow. Once the first rain starts falling and it cools down a bit, I will be off for my first packrafting trip. <br /><br /><object width="800" height="450"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=13211055&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=ff9933&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=13211055&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=ff9933&amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="800" height="450"></embed></object><br /><br />In the trips section, Roman Dial posted another episode of his fantastic packrafting trip suggestions, <a href="http://packrafting.blogspot.com/2010/07/chitistone-skolai-pass-to-mccarthy.html">The Chitistone: Skolai Pass to McCarthy</a>.

Since a while I have been using the <a href="http://www.clikstand.com/">Clikstand</a> system to brew my hot chocolate when on a evening or day walk. It reminds me very much of the Trangia, but does away with the massive weight of the Swedish system. I have two of their combos, the <a href="http://www.clikstand.com/p_combinations_titanium.html">Denali Titanium Combo</a> and the <a href="http://www.clikstand.com/p_combinations_ssteel.html">Sierra Combo</a> - the Denali being Titanium awesomeness and the Sierra being affordable stainless steel. <br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/boeLd8-spXXcGNyH7cE9aivoLD1Hlr9wZnl_cc9kSyA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TDcryTaPu0I/AAAAAAAAC4Y/xIRhHItdtRQ/s800/IMG_7856.jpg" /></a><br /><br />Before you read on, hit play and enjoy the video I made, in which I compare the two systems to each other:<br /><br /><object width="640" height="505"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/EXyWhfnU5Jo&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?color1=0xe1600f&amp;color2=0xfebd01"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/EXyWhfnU5Jo&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?color1=0xe1600f&amp;color2=0xfebd01" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="505"></embed></object><br /><br />The Denali Titanium Combo weights are as follows:<br /><br />258 g Total <br />055 g Clikstand T-2<br />021 g Windscreen T-2<br />035 g Evernew Titanium Burner<br />118 g Evernew Titanium Ultralight 900 ml pot (Pot 82 g, Lid 37 g)<br />022 g Stuffsack<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/0mBI4BBSzm0ogIVocDjpeivoLD1Hlr9wZnl_cc9kSyA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TDcr__B-PTI/AAAAAAAAC4c/GPTzO0G_V_w/s800/IMG_7871.jpg" /></a><br />The Denali Titanium Combo packed.<br /><br />The Denali is the top of the line set, everything made of high quality Titanium, and very high build quality. The whole set fits into the 900 ml pot. And the pot would be one item where I could see improvement - I&#8217;d like to see Evernew add a spout and holes into the lid, as they have in their pasta pots. Besides that, I believe this is as close to perfection as it is possible. Quality and perfection have their price, and the Denali Titanium Combo retails for $163,95. <br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/MzRoLvd6Vour4f32DbFhtCvoLD1Hlr9wZnl_cc9kSyA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TDcsevYqaLI/AAAAAAAAC4o/qeVL1Ob8iTU/s800/IMG_7835.jpg" /></a><br />Evernew Ti Burner in action.<br /><br />Lets thus have a look at the Sierra Combo and its weights:<br /><br />245 g Total<br />096 g Clikstand S-2<br />038 g Windscreen S-2<br />111 g Trangia Burner (Burner 67 g, Simmer Ring 24 g, Closing Cap 21 g)<br /><br />The Sierra Combo sells without a pot, thus adding for example the above Evernew 900 ml pot would bring the weight up to 363 g. That is about one third of the Trangia 25-3 UL set (though it has two pots and a pan) which I see as the direct competitor of the Sierra Set. Anyway, the Sierra Combo is 134 g heavier as the Titanium version - the Trangia burner alone weights as much as the Ti Clikstand, Windscreen and Burner! However, at $51,95 it is also over one third cheaper than the Ti cousin. <br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/jWGOm68A1U8pV8A3VXh_hCvoLD1Hlr9wZnl_cc9kSyA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TDcslGa1YVI/AAAAAAAAC4s/j0fw0PFT0fc/s800/IMG_7848.jpg" /></a><br />Trangia burner in action.<br /><br />I think both systems are great for the Lightweight and UL backpacker who are looking for a lighter kitchen setup. The advantages are that the parts can be bought separate, allowing the Trangia and Evernew Burner owners to just get the Clikstand and Windscreen of choice and keep on using the burner and pots they have. It is easier and more &#8220;normal&#8221; as some other UL cooking systems (beer cans ;), and a very stable system. Finally, the Trangia simmer ring allows you to actually cook and not only boil water. <br /><br />The Evernew Burner is a lot faster than the Trangia, needing about 5 minutes to bring 500 ml of cold water to a boil, whereas the Trangia needs about 7 minutes. However, the Evernew burns only 7,5 minutes with 30 ml of alcohol, whereas the Trangia goes on for 10 minutes with the same amount of alcohol. As I said in the video, if you only want to boil water as fast as possible to pour it in our freezer bag, go for the Evernew - it is the speed machine. If you like to cook and simmer in camp, go for the Trangia, which has the added benefit that you can transport unused alcohol in thanks to the closing cap.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/D3rBMRUIVQIM6KTLP7oSIyvoLD1Hlr9wZnl_cc9kSyA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TDcsxsGg_PI/AAAAAAAAC4w/Jn88T_CJVBY/s800/IMG_7862.jpg" /></a></div>
