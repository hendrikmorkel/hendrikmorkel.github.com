Here and there I already mentioned that I am the fortunate owner of a new backpack, something very innovative, made by a UL cottage-in-stealth-mode from Germany, called LAUFBURSCHE. Here I want to present you a first look at this backpack, which is still a prototype but very close to the finished product which will go on sale during this summer. It is called the LAUFBURSCHE huckePACK.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/lQ4taPOvIqGa7Gk7OwPIkw?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6s_zVssQ2I/AAAAAAAAB-Q/rWrnfIEfU4E/s800/IMG_6146.JPG" /></a><br />UL awesomeness from Germany!<br /><br />I met the maker of the huckePACK during the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/2010/02/tufwt-10-trip-report.html">TUFWT 1.0</a> and could see for myself the packs in action. Mine above, packed with complete food and summer gear for an overnighter, has a 35 liter volume which can be expanded to 49 l thanks to the extendable collar. It is made of black silnylon, while the bottom is made of XPAC. <br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/l7FDrbmeWoROwu7yWlN-VQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6s-8WPN6XI/AAAAAAAAB90/z1IubrNN1_I/s800/IMG_6112.JPG" /></a><br />Front view. The front mesh pocket has plenty of space, and I can fit all my small stuff in there.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/3bC5YHZMdd1VKl1zpaFA0w?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6s_iq2ciQI/AAAAAAAAB-E/Bop7sWi6gJg/s800/IMG_6121.JPG" /></a><br />The lid. This is the most innovative lid I have seen thus far, and enables the pack to be nearly 100% waterproof. Check also the 3D shoulder strap.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Llwybg5dKrxRPXUajVjvWA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6s_nOg9bMI/AAAAAAAAB-I/I7ymsmWmjNQ/s800/IMG_6124.JPG" /></a><br />Backside. The shoulder straps are the most comfortable ones I have ever experienced, anatomically formed and of a very light yet durable material, 3D.<br /><br />The weight of this pack, which has removable trailpole holders, sternum strap, compression cordage, load lifters and much more, is 330 g. The craftsmanship is superb, &#8220;Quality Made in Germany&#8221; which doesn&#8217;t need to hide in comparison to established cottages. What I really like is that LAUFBURSCHE has used only the lightest components and best material available, without compromises. There is nothing fancy and extra, no big buckles or similar, only the smallest, lightest, highest quality material available. <br /><br />I used the huckePACK so far on small training trips, and it carries great; my summer kit fits in there with plenty of space to spare. This will be my go-to pack for probably all trips from summer till autumn. And before you ask: The LAUFBURSCHE huckePACK is not yet commercially available. You can check the as of the moment inactive <a href="http://www.laufbursche.blogspot.com">LAUFBURSCHE blog</a> (it should go life in a couple of weeks) about the upcoming launch of the cottage, which plans to offer the packs as a standard in black and grey silnylon as well as grey Dyneema X Gridstop, and other colours and materials will be as special wishes available. You&#8217;ll be able to see more of my huckePACK here in a couple of weeks in a video, when I will show you how to pack it, and what kind of Tardis it is!<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/y7UY6TP3kMsZP4eQqNxVdQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6tSJMmjtLI/AAAAAAAAB-0/gHiJStPry9A/s800/IMG_6133.JPG" /></a><br />Looking forward to summer backpacking!</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Five o&#8217;clock in the morning, time to get up. It is still dark outside, and I try to convince myself that I need to get out of the bed now, if I want to catch all the trains and the only bus to Repovesi national park. Coffee, smoothie, an apple and pear put into the side pocket of the <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/02/gear-talk-golite-pinnacle-2010-backpack.html">Pinnacle</a>, and off I go to the railway station, which is already busy with people. Five hours later the bus driver lets me out at the road to Lapinsalmi, the entrance of the national park. Already here there is silence, and only the occasional bird song disturbs the tranquility. Four kilometers later I stand at the entrance, a huge parking lot is witness to the masses of people which must be here in the summer and on weekends.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/asEjufPZTtTBTquaSJba9w?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjdz9m0rcGr_QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6Hgz4cGQjI/AAAAAAAAB4k/bCcy2j9PRRI/s800/P1030224.JPG" /></a><br />On the way to Lapinsalmi.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/KcFT0dipI9GCYZKZOXSvIQ?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjdz9m0rcGr_QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6HhALPQDNI/AAAAAAAAB4o/rbzpXyMFIN4/s800/P1030240.JPG" /></a><br />On top of Lapinsalmi hanging bridge.<br /><br />The trail towards Lapinsalmi hanging bridge is well worn out, testifying that the weekend must have been busy with folks - snowshoes not yet needed. The clouds disappear, I cross the bridge and go down to the hut. Lunch time, refilling water bottles in the stream, observing the woodpecker close by, enjoying the sun. <br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/YRLHqzs9ujNltcjwqPRnNA?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjdz9m0rcGr_QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6HhGe8U_5I/AAAAAAAAB4s/g9BV07fT_Nw/s800/P1030248.JPG" /></a><br />Guerilla marketing.<br /><br />As I continue, I see the tracks of the guy which got out a few kilometers before me, and follow them back to the hut. He carries a 70+ l backpack, has a Pulka with him, and is of course German. We chat a few minutes, but he ain&#8217;t too social so I continue. I follow the trail for a moment, but because it goes up and down the hills I decide to take the easy route - the frozen Katajajärvi lake. I always feel a bit uneasy on the ice, even if it is -8°C and only a few centimeters of snow cover, my concentration is on and I am listening to possible cracks. I should feel save, after all there&#8217;s a well worn ski trail, but somehow I&#8217;m not totally relaxed.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/94plntqzAG5jT14-EtA3Zw?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjdz9m0rcGr_QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6HhODbv1fI/AAAAAAAAB4w/sYwxFQidUqU/s800/P1030266.JPG" /></a><br />Leaving tracks on Katajajärvi lake.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/GlzD8GVfGkF3D57WhzlY5A?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjdz9m0rcGr_QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6HhTtGdunI/AAAAAAAAB40/kIs8tivjXso/s800/P1030271.JPG" /></a><br />View on Mustavuori hill, across the Kuutinlahti lake.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/bTq1Lic7wVxysXrcCsrdWQ?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjdz9m0rcGr_QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6HhgariWsI/AAAAAAAAB44/coxwP4mVHv0/s800/P1030295.JPG" /></a><br />Spring is in the air - most trees were already snow free.<br /><br />I walk over Kuutinlahti lake towards the hut, have a short peek inside and continue towards the Mustavuori hill. A 109 m ascent, and some folks did this without snowshoes, potholing the complete way up - in nearly a meter of snow, quite a feat. The view is worth it, though. I walk along the cliff, take in the view and spot a nice site where I&#8217;d like to pitch the tarp and start compressing the snow before I continue to the viewing tower, so it has time to settle.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/5uDbWbOAbKsz8kfB32cjQA?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjdz9m0rcGr_QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6HhyWfN9ZI/AAAAAAAAB5M/BH9k7DSrpTQ/s800/P1030316.JPG" /></a><br />View from the tower across Kuutinlahti lake and the Ruskiasalmi strait.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/8yrZsx1FdGaBmgrc5siInQ?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjdz9m0rcGr_QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6Hh79EzYVI/AAAAAAAAB5U/RV_8eqa0bsY/s800/P1030324.JPG" /></a><br />Olhavanvuori in the distance.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/0uplb1Fgiu2tm_g7VZ4sHQ?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjdz9m0rcGr_QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6HuJ8s4eYI/AAAAAAAAB68/gO7JvmNp1uo/s800/Owl_ball.jpg" /></a><br />The view tower seems to be a favourite spot of owls, as this owl pellet shows.<br /><br />Back at the designated site to pitch the tarp I am encountering a problem as I put the trekking pole in the snow - another 90 cm of snow till the bottom. I wonder, should I dig a snow cave, bivy under the clear sky or go down to the hut? After a while of wrestling with my own comfort zone, I decide to take the easy way out, and descent down towards the hut. <br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/ct7Em_WSk1UMNdJ8olVViA?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjdz9m0rcGr_QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6HpsLDLsFI/AAAAAAAAB5Y/rk4xDZAYXiA/s800/P1030334.JPG" /></a><br />Deep snow.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/jGz66bTxQfdMFriZ8kusEw?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjdz9m0rcGr_QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6HpzNT9sFI/AAAAAAAAB5g/N_RZhpoIDDE/s800/P1030354.JPG" /></a><br />Dusk ain&#8217;t too bad from down here.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/40BNDs_wFFZxcX8hGLTEXA?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjdz9m0rcGr_QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6Hqdl13wnI/AAAAAAAAB58/hZePGl4cllw/s800/P1030372.JPG" /></a><br />The comfort zone.<br /><br />The fire is going, sausages are barbecued, I sawed plenty of wood for the night, and enjoy the clear sky with its millions of stars. The ice is cracking, an owl is hooting, and I roll out the sleeping bag and mats, boil water for the night bouillon and tuck myself in. A fine night, waking up every once in a while to throw more wood on the fire, and relaxed I wake up at seven the next morning. The fire is still going, and I heat up the rest of the bouillon for breakfast, pack up and start walking again.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/NTAvid7hq_644Pf-7bqquA?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjdz9m0rcGr_QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6HqnB9sMtI/AAAAAAAAB6A/3pUtWZKfwcA/s800/P1030386.JPG" /></a><br />The collapsed cliffs at Kuutinkanava, an amazing acoustic here, no wonder they have concerts here in the summers.<br /><br />I head towards Kuutinkanava over the lake, enjoy the echo, have a look at the old log flute and continue through the forest towards the Katajajärvi fire site and onwards towards Kapiavesi fire site. Passing over the ice towards the Lapinsalmi entrance, I see the German&#8217;s red pulka in the distance at the Lapinsalmi hut - apparently he didn&#8217;t venture further and stayed there for the night. The four kilometers towards the main road are walked quickly, and ten minutes later I was able to hitch a ride to Kouvola.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/w4rKSZUDOwB-0xttrm339Q?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjdz9m0rcGr_QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6HqvqvPPgI/AAAAAAAAB6E/qRiUYLH_wfk/s800/P1030397.JPG" /></a><br />Mouse tracks in the snow.<br /><br />It were two beautiful days out. I am a bit disappointed with myself that I didn&#8217;t succeed in wildcamping on top of Mustavuori, I reckon the sunset and dawn would have been very impressive from up there - the next time then. Too bad I also only had two days time, there would have been more hills to climb and sights to see, and at the moment it is perfect to navigate there, as you can use the frozen lakes, which is a lot easier than scrambling through the forest. I hope to return there while the lakes are frozen and the snow is covering the land, it is a beautiful national park and not many people are around. Anyone want to go for a weekend?<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/C5Z96XIy_I9o_5tNjMl1GA?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjdz9m0rcGr_QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6Hq1YDhGgI/AAAAAAAAB6I/jTTxvSL_yco/s800/P1030412.JPG" /></a></div>

The idea of this article is to give you some tips on how to weigh especially bulky or big items, how to categorize them and how to make a packlist. It should help you to determine how heavy your pack is, and gives you the opportunity to easily see where possible weight savings can be made.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/gCBTtDG9o8ecsoqPHz_nrA?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S5vCgtpmwtI/AAAAAAAAB08/vdP08rsYlSs/s800/IMG_6442.JPG" /></a><br />All the gear for my <a href="http://www.luontoon.fi/page.asp?Section=5261">Repovesi</a> trip.<br /><br />The first thing you should do once you decide to lighten up your backpack, is to weigh your gear. A digital scale which can give you the weight in gram is what I use, those who use ounces and pounds likely will use a scale with these measurements. Either way, a digital scale with as small increments as possible should be your first investment when you decide to lighten up. I have one which can weigh stuff up to 5 kg in 1 g increments, and has a tare function. The tare is important, as in that way you can use something to balance big items on the scale which otherwise would touch the table and thus might not represent the accurate weight. Tare usually functions so that you put your scale on, wait till it shows it is ready, place the bowl or other item on it and hit tare, now its back to zero and you can start weighting your bulky gear. Check the photos to see what I mean.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Iy-84uYZlEnPK0sw6k13Fw?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S5vF9XVKn-I/AAAAAAAAB1o/ZD225YqtJtc/s800/P1030100.JPG" /></a><br /><a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/01/video-msr-lightning-ascent-review.html">MSR Lightning Ascent</a> snowshoes on the scale, with the help of a bowl and tare function the exact weight can be determined.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/9R1nwRajWTDxBIAfiqpi1Q?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S5vGA73rDzI/AAAAAAAAB10/x1GRNkjWYuE/s800/P1030102.JPG" /></a><br />The <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/02/gear-talk-golite-pinnacle-2010-backpack.html">GoLite Pinnacle</a> has a lot of straps and is bulky, again with the help of the bowl its easy to measure the weight.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/46o6Mk4d6Z9l-nOPlSZAyA?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S5vF-cO30eI/AAAAAAAAB1s/Ta58YtF54z8/s800/P1030101.JPG" /></a><br />Also small items, like these MLD snow gaiters, can be easily weigh.<br /><br />As you can see, I document the weight on a piece of paper, if I&#8217;d be smart I would take my laptop right next to it and save writing it twice. There&#8217;s a plethora of gear calculators out there, but the majority of folks seem to use the good old spreadsheet to list and calculate their gear weights. And why not, its easy, and with the help of <a href="http://docs.google.com/">Google docs</a> you even can store it online and have it open for other people to see and comment on. That&#8217;s what I did with my Repovesi packlist, and you can view it <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AuhX9Un08Z3EdHdPLUthb0ZjM1hNZ0JtUFViNURXQUE&hl=en">here</a>. There&#8217;s also <a href="http://www.geargrams.com/">GearGrams</a> if spreadsheets and formulas are not your métier, but I haven&#8217;t tried that out.<br /><br />I sort the gear in various categories, that makes it easier to oversee. There&#8217;s packing, shelter & sleeping, kitchen, clothing, various and consumables. I also list my camera kit under its own category, but you could just put it under various if you want to make it simpler. At the end I calculate the total of everything, and then sort by consumables, pack weight excluding consumables and with consumables and what I wear. That gives me the information I need to know, and leaves nothing out. <br /><br />So, with the help of this spreadsheet I now know exactly what I am carrying - it is also a useful checklist to see if everything is packed when leaving, and after a trip I can open the spreadsheet and see what actually got used, what didn&#8217;t, if I took too much food with me or if it was too less or just right, and where potential weight savings could be achieved. For me on this trip, I carry a few luxury items with me, like my woolen camp shoes, an extra piece of Z Lite as camp seat, a nice piece of cheese and reindeer ham and a book. I could save some weight by taking a lighter headlamp, leave the Nalgene at home and make a cozy for the Platy, combine sleeping system with camp gear, but I&#8217;d need a VBL suit for that and as I don&#8217;t have one yet that&#8217;s currently not an option. And I am expecting temperatures of -14°C so I&#8217;d rather have a good, warm sleeping bag with me, and sufficient isolation to the ground.<br /><br />I hope this gave you some ideas on how to weigh and list your gear before you go around shopping for new equipment. Listing things up with their weight helps you to make informed decisions where the easiest and best weight savings can be made, before going on a shopping spree =)<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/SB8GRJCrgPIovliopwmE7A?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S5vDDuXWXbI/AAAAAAAAB1M/3QC8XyqgCn0/s800/IMG_6449.JPG" /></a><br />Packed and ready to hike!</div>
