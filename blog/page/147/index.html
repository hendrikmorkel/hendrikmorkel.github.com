  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Five o&#8217;clock in the morning, time to get up. It is still dark outside, and I try to convince myself that I need to get out of the bed now, if I want to catch all the trains and the only bus to Repovesi national park. Coffee, smoothie, an apple and pear put into the side pocket of the <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/02/gear-talk-golite-pinnacle-2010-backpack.html">Pinnacle</a>, and off I go to the railway station, which is already busy with people. Five hours later the bus driver lets me out at the road to Lapinsalmi, the entrance of the national park. Already here there is silence, and only the occasional bird song disturbs the tranquility. Four kilometers later I stand at the entrance, a huge parking lot is witness to the masses of people which must be here in the summer and on weekends.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/asEjufPZTtTBTquaSJba9w?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjdz9m0rcGr_QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6Hgz4cGQjI/AAAAAAAAB4k/bCcy2j9PRRI/s800/P1030224.JPG" /></a><br />On the way to Lapinsalmi.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/KcFT0dipI9GCYZKZOXSvIQ?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjdz9m0rcGr_QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6HhALPQDNI/AAAAAAAAB4o/rbzpXyMFIN4/s800/P1030240.JPG" /></a><br />On top of Lapinsalmi hanging bridge.<br /><br />The trail towards Lapinsalmi hanging bridge is well worn out, testifying that the weekend must have been busy with folks - snowshoes not yet needed. The clouds disappear, I cross the bridge and go down to the hut. Lunch time, refilling water bottles in the stream, observing the woodpecker close by, enjoying the sun. <br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/YRLHqzs9ujNltcjwqPRnNA?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjdz9m0rcGr_QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6HhGe8U_5I/AAAAAAAAB4s/g9BV07fT_Nw/s800/P1030248.JPG" /></a><br />Guerilla marketing.<br /><br />As I continue, I see the tracks of the guy which got out a few kilometers before me, and follow them back to the hut. He carries a 70+ l backpack, has a Pulka with him, and is of course German. We chat a few minutes, but he ain&#8217;t too social so I continue. I follow the trail for a moment, but because it goes up and down the hills I decide to take the easy route - the frozen Katajajärvi lake. I always feel a bit uneasy on the ice, even if it is -8°C and only a few centimeters of snow cover, my concentration is on and I am listening to possible cracks. I should feel save, after all there&#8217;s a well worn ski trail, but somehow I&#8217;m not totally relaxed.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/94plntqzAG5jT14-EtA3Zw?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjdz9m0rcGr_QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6HhODbv1fI/AAAAAAAAB4w/sYwxFQidUqU/s800/P1030266.JPG" /></a><br />Leaving tracks on Katajajärvi lake.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/GlzD8GVfGkF3D57WhzlY5A?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjdz9m0rcGr_QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6HhTtGdunI/AAAAAAAAB40/kIs8tivjXso/s800/P1030271.JPG" /></a><br />View on Mustavuori hill, across the Kuutinlahti lake.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/bTq1Lic7wVxysXrcCsrdWQ?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjdz9m0rcGr_QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6HhgariWsI/AAAAAAAAB44/coxwP4mVHv0/s800/P1030295.JPG" /></a><br />Spring is in the air - most trees were already snow free.<br /><br />I walk over Kuutinlahti lake towards the hut, have a short peek inside and continue towards the Mustavuori hill. A 109 m ascent, and some folks did this without snowshoes, potholing the complete way up - in nearly a meter of snow, quite a feat. The view is worth it, though. I walk along the cliff, take in the view and spot a nice site where I&#8217;d like to pitch the tarp and start compressing the snow before I continue to the viewing tower, so it has time to settle.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/5uDbWbOAbKsz8kfB32cjQA?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjdz9m0rcGr_QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6HhyWfN9ZI/AAAAAAAAB5M/BH9k7DSrpTQ/s800/P1030316.JPG" /></a><br />View from the tower across Kuutinlahti lake and the Ruskiasalmi strait.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/8yrZsx1FdGaBmgrc5siInQ?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjdz9m0rcGr_QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6Hh79EzYVI/AAAAAAAAB5U/RV_8eqa0bsY/s800/P1030324.JPG" /></a><br />Olhavanvuori in the distance.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/0uplb1Fgiu2tm_g7VZ4sHQ?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjdz9m0rcGr_QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6HuJ8s4eYI/AAAAAAAAB68/gO7JvmNp1uo/s800/Owl_ball.jpg" /></a><br />The view tower seems to be a favourite spot of owls, as this owl pellet shows.<br /><br />Back at the designated site to pitch the tarp I am encountering a problem as I put the trekking pole in the snow - another 90 cm of snow till the bottom. I wonder, should I dig a snow cave, bivy under the clear sky or go down to the hut? After a while of wrestling with my own comfort zone, I decide to take the easy way out, and descent down towards the hut. <br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/ct7Em_WSk1UMNdJ8olVViA?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjdz9m0rcGr_QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6HpsLDLsFI/AAAAAAAAB5Y/rk4xDZAYXiA/s800/P1030334.JPG" /></a><br />Deep snow.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/jGz66bTxQfdMFriZ8kusEw?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjdz9m0rcGr_QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6HpzNT9sFI/AAAAAAAAB5g/N_RZhpoIDDE/s800/P1030354.JPG" /></a><br />Dusk ain&#8217;t too bad from down here.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/40BNDs_wFFZxcX8hGLTEXA?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjdz9m0rcGr_QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6Hqdl13wnI/AAAAAAAAB58/hZePGl4cllw/s800/P1030372.JPG" /></a><br />The comfort zone.<br /><br />The fire is going, sausages are barbecued, I sawed plenty of wood for the night, and enjoy the clear sky with its millions of stars. The ice is cracking, an owl is hooting, and I roll out the sleeping bag and mats, boil water for the night bouillon and tuck myself in. A fine night, waking up every once in a while to throw more wood on the fire, and relaxed I wake up at seven the next morning. The fire is still going, and I heat up the rest of the bouillon for breakfast, pack up and start walking again.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/NTAvid7hq_644Pf-7bqquA?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjdz9m0rcGr_QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6HqnB9sMtI/AAAAAAAAB6A/3pUtWZKfwcA/s800/P1030386.JPG" /></a><br />The collapsed cliffs at Kuutinkanava, an amazing acoustic here, no wonder they have concerts here in the summers.<br /><br />I head towards Kuutinkanava over the lake, enjoy the echo, have a look at the old log flute and continue through the forest towards the Katajajärvi fire site and onwards towards Kapiavesi fire site. Passing over the ice towards the Lapinsalmi entrance, I see the German&#8217;s red pulka in the distance at the Lapinsalmi hut - apparently he didn&#8217;t venture further and stayed there for the night. The four kilometers towards the main road are walked quickly, and ten minutes later I was able to hitch a ride to Kouvola.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/w4rKSZUDOwB-0xttrm339Q?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjdz9m0rcGr_QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6HqvqvPPgI/AAAAAAAAB6E/qRiUYLH_wfk/s800/P1030397.JPG" /></a><br />Mouse tracks in the snow.<br /><br />It were two beautiful days out. I am a bit disappointed with myself that I didn&#8217;t succeed in wildcamping on top of Mustavuori, I reckon the sunset and dawn would have been very impressive from up there - the next time then. Too bad I also only had two days time, there would have been more hills to climb and sights to see, and at the moment it is perfect to navigate there, as you can use the frozen lakes, which is a lot easier than scrambling through the forest. I hope to return there while the lakes are frozen and the snow is covering the land, it is a beautiful national park and not many people are around. Anyone want to go for a weekend?<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/C5Z96XIy_I9o_5tNjMl1GA?authkey=Gv1sRgCLjdz9m0rcGr_QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6Hq1YDhGgI/AAAAAAAAB6I/jTTxvSL_yco/s800/P1030412.JPG" /></a></div>

The idea of this article is to give you some tips on how to weigh especially bulky or big items, how to categorize them and how to make a packlist. It should help you to determine how heavy your pack is, and gives you the opportunity to easily see where possible weight savings can be made.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/gCBTtDG9o8ecsoqPHz_nrA?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S5vCgtpmwtI/AAAAAAAAB08/vdP08rsYlSs/s800/IMG_6442.JPG" /></a><br />All the gear for my <a href="http://www.luontoon.fi/page.asp?Section=5261">Repovesi</a> trip.<br /><br />The first thing you should do once you decide to lighten up your backpack, is to weigh your gear. A digital scale which can give you the weight in gram is what I use, those who use ounces and pounds likely will use a scale with these measurements. Either way, a digital scale with as small increments as possible should be your first investment when you decide to lighten up. I have one which can weigh stuff up to 5 kg in 1 g increments, and has a tare function. The tare is important, as in that way you can use something to balance big items on the scale which otherwise would touch the table and thus might not represent the accurate weight. Tare usually functions so that you put your scale on, wait till it shows it is ready, place the bowl or other item on it and hit tare, now its back to zero and you can start weighting your bulky gear. Check the photos to see what I mean.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Iy-84uYZlEnPK0sw6k13Fw?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S5vF9XVKn-I/AAAAAAAAB1o/ZD225YqtJtc/s800/P1030100.JPG" /></a><br /><a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/01/video-msr-lightning-ascent-review.html">MSR Lightning Ascent</a> snowshoes on the scale, with the help of a bowl and tare function the exact weight can be determined.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/9R1nwRajWTDxBIAfiqpi1Q?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S5vGA73rDzI/AAAAAAAAB10/x1GRNkjWYuE/s800/P1030102.JPG" /></a><br />The <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/02/gear-talk-golite-pinnacle-2010-backpack.html">GoLite Pinnacle</a> has a lot of straps and is bulky, again with the help of the bowl its easy to measure the weight.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/46o6Mk4d6Z9l-nOPlSZAyA?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S5vF-cO30eI/AAAAAAAAB1s/Ta58YtF54z8/s800/P1030101.JPG" /></a><br />Also small items, like these MLD snow gaiters, can be easily weigh.<br /><br />As you can see, I document the weight on a piece of paper, if I&#8217;d be smart I would take my laptop right next to it and save writing it twice. There&#8217;s a plethora of gear calculators out there, but the majority of folks seem to use the good old spreadsheet to list and calculate their gear weights. And why not, its easy, and with the help of <a href="http://docs.google.com/">Google docs</a> you even can store it online and have it open for other people to see and comment on. That&#8217;s what I did with my Repovesi packlist, and you can view it <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AuhX9Un08Z3EdHdPLUthb0ZjM1hNZ0JtUFViNURXQUE&hl=en">here</a>. There&#8217;s also <a href="http://www.geargrams.com/">GearGrams</a> if spreadsheets and formulas are not your métier, but I haven&#8217;t tried that out.<br /><br />I sort the gear in various categories, that makes it easier to oversee. There&#8217;s packing, shelter & sleeping, kitchen, clothing, various and consumables. I also list my camera kit under its own category, but you could just put it under various if you want to make it simpler. At the end I calculate the total of everything, and then sort by consumables, pack weight excluding consumables and with consumables and what I wear. That gives me the information I need to know, and leaves nothing out. <br /><br />So, with the help of this spreadsheet I now know exactly what I am carrying - it is also a useful checklist to see if everything is packed when leaving, and after a trip I can open the spreadsheet and see what actually got used, what didn&#8217;t, if I took too much food with me or if it was too less or just right, and where potential weight savings could be achieved. For me on this trip, I carry a few luxury items with me, like my woolen camp shoes, an extra piece of Z Lite as camp seat, a nice piece of cheese and reindeer ham and a book. I could save some weight by taking a lighter headlamp, leave the Nalgene at home and make a cozy for the Platy, combine sleeping system with camp gear, but I&#8217;d need a VBL suit for that and as I don&#8217;t have one yet that&#8217;s currently not an option. And I am expecting temperatures of -14°C so I&#8217;d rather have a good, warm sleeping bag with me, and sufficient isolation to the ground.<br /><br />I hope this gave you some ideas on how to weigh and list your gear before you go around shopping for new equipment. Listing things up with their weight helps you to make informed decisions where the easiest and best weight savings can be made, before going on a shopping spree =)<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/SB8GRJCrgPIovliopwmE7A?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S5vDDuXWXbI/AAAAAAAAB1M/3QC8XyqgCn0/s800/IMG_6449.JPG" /></a><br />Packed and ready to hike!</div>

A few weeks ago I met my Finnish friend Matti, and discussing over a beer we decided to go for a weekend trip together soon, a one-nighter close by Tampere. Fast forward to Saturday, 6th of March at the bus stop, where we meet again. Matti with his 260 cm long skis and I with my <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/01/video-msr-lightning-ascent-review.html">snowshoes</a>, perfect sunshine and a bit of snow coming down from heaven, we talk about hiking and how great it is to go out for a night.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/HHqPIl-OLctlvPej4fbTPw?authkey=Gv1sRgCLmRuYfL4oL-5AE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S5QCguq4YuI/AAAAAAAABzY/O1Svkxf-dxg/s800/IMG_6221.JPG" /></a><br />It&#8217;s still getting better.<br /><br />An hour later we get out at the lonely bus stop in the middle of nowhere. <a href="http://www.luontoon.fi/page.asp?Section=873">Siikaneva</a> is Southern Finland&#8217;s biggest swamp area, and wide rolling marshes intermixed with little patches of forest will be our sight this weekend. But before we&#8217;ll see any of it, a short three to four kilometer hike to the area needs to be made. Matti asks me if we go on the road or off piste, and seeing that I am in capable hands I let him guide us off piste through the forest. He does a good job, and an hour later we arrive at the entry.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Q38_TW88SKaTIRn0G_chhg?authkey=Gv1sRgCLmRuYfL4oL-5AE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S5QB3f9hdnI/AAAAAAAABzA/JnAcrjzRNEo/s800/IMG_6166.JPG" /></a><br />On the way in, still glorious sunshine.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/P6TvXOJ9unNUP89Z5VKt2Q?authkey=Gv1sRgCLmRuYfL4oL-5AE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S5QB4Iv3jiI/AAAAAAAABzE/CgXsKmWCf38/s800/IMG_6167.JPG" /></a><br />Wind blown snow holes.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/YuGwmtzF0TssK4Yculqk1g?authkey=Gv1sRgCLmRuYfL4oL-5AE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S5QB4-nZlnI/AAAAAAAABzI/w75Y14M4dug/s800/IMG_6179.JPG" /></a><br />At the start of Siikaneva, the fox tracks leading into the forest.<br /><br />With our arriving at Siikaneva also the clouds arrive, and the previous blue sky is covered in grey. Matti gives me a short rundown how to navigate, and so we break yet again more trail in a straight line to the camp. The snow carries well although I do break in a couple of times, one time so deep that I need help from Matti to pull me out. I repay the favour to Matti a bit later, and realize that also on skis one can tumble and fall =)<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/qs0GePvyeyyanHzZAweQIg?authkey=Gv1sRgCLmRuYfL4oL-5AE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S5QB5UBAZHI/AAAAAAAABzM/MIdTvt_7-gk/s800/IMG_6185.JPG" /></a><br />A few sparse trees in the swamp&#8230;<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/OjSJLlchy12dwn6lXtUjmA?authkey=Gv1sRgCLmRuYfL4oL-5AE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S5QB6MiEhOI/AAAAAAAABzQ/O_cACN3rvYk/s800/IMG_6191.JPG" /></a><br />&#8230; and many huddled together on the rocky outcrops.<br /><br />Matti tells me that our camp is on top of a hill, and so our ascent starts. Its slightly easier with snowshoes, but where the snow is soft I break in till my crotch, and getting out of that is difficult, for a beginner like me at least. I do succeed and manage to get to the top, just to hear Matti tell me that I should come down as I went in my effort to &#8220;bag the peak&#8221; a bit too far away from the direction we should be going to.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/NqBiMAH52bMNJImA7dr0Xg?authkey=Gv1sRgCLmRuYfL4oL-5AE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S5QCf76_-AI/AAAAAAAABzU/fEWGCkzJhsw/s800/IMG_6202.JPG" /></a><br />Breaking in.<br /><br />We arrive at camp, where there&#8217;s six other people and the fire is going. I put on more clothes, drink some cold tea and eat a musli bar, while the other Finns throw their sausages on the grill and open their beers. There&#8217;s a couple there, about my age, and we have amusing conversations with them. The man is German, and it goes again to show that whereever you go, you&#8217;re bound to meet Germans! Later they pack up their Fjällpulka with enough supplies and equipment to last them a week in Lapland, and start the four kilometer trek back to the parking lot. <br /><br />Being alone now, we roll out the pads and let the sleeping bags loft, while we chop more wood for the night. As we&#8217;re finished, the sun starts to set, and it is the most beautiful sunset I can remember. We stand on the rocky outcrop and enjoy the view over the vast swamp area towards where the sun sets, a magnificent display of colours accompanying it. <br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/4JNz7guJkj1CN4KrcCRX-w?authkey=Gv1sRgCLmRuYfL4oL-5AE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S5QCha8TN7I/AAAAAAAABzc/hVVgkuerdYk/s800/IMG_6244.JPG" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/EBkaYOqVrpKYuW2rt8Er7Q?authkey=Gv1sRgCLmRuYfL4oL-5AE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S5QCiQgPvkI/AAAAAAAABzk/xKjZarQBxnI/s800/_MG_6273.JPG" /></a><br />Warming my hands at the fire.<br /><br />The sky clears and millions of stars illuminate it, making it a perfect night. We enjoy dinner and a few Minttu Kakaos before we throw some big logs on the fire and creep into our sleeping bags. I read a bit more in the light of the fire before I doze off into the realm of dreams, waking up a few times at night to have a pee and throw more wood on the fire. <br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/6fOaTH3vcnzOtzQDNtPaAA?authkey=Gv1sRgCLmRuYfL4oL-5AE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S5QCkWvGPfI/AAAAAAAABzs/udLrIy22hi4/s800/_MG_6339.JPG" /></a><br />View from my sleeping bag the next morning =)<br /><br />I get up around nine the next morning, make a new fire, set my shoes close to it, have a few bites from my Flapjack and go back into the sleeping bag. Its to early to be up on a Sunday, I decide, and read a bit while listening to the bird songs. The sun is out again, and no cloud is to be seen in the sky. Glorious weather to be outdoors.<br /><br />We take our time to eat breakfast, chop more wood for the people who might come after us, and pack up. As we leave around half one, already four other day trippers are sitting around the fire and grilling their sausages. Finns and their sausages! Off the rocky outcrop and down into the swamp, the sun is almost blinding. Spectacular, and so we ski and walk towards the road, mostly off track, exploring the little patches of forests and the hidden swamps.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/iJaVSFhbb6VQHWgqvm7yOg?authkey=Gv1sRgCLmRuYfL4oL-5AE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S5TAFrT2nzI/AAAAAAAAB0g/gC4b0MDgd_k/s800/_MG_6346.JPG" /></a><br />Matti on his skis.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/5JuzB31WUgi5jUxUlU6l5A?authkey=Gv1sRgCLmRuYfL4oL-5AE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S5QCl7wWzQI/AAAAAAAABzw/j_n0Lq95HiA/s800/_MG_6352.JPG" /></a><br />Rabbit tracks leading into the forest.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/JAHZ-cmmeN4EbVbVUwS_0w?authkey=Gv1sRgCLmRuYfL4oL-5AE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S5QCmUqXHQI/AAAAAAAABz0/JiH_Kqs8btM/s800/_MG_6358.JPG" /></a><br />Self portrait.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/dxugiydDjpB513Ohd9alpQ?authkey=Gv1sRgCLmRuYfL4oL-5AE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S5QCnB3ipmI/AAAAAAAABz4/_9BavYzzEGw/s800/_MG_6368.JPG" /></a><br />Fox tracks leading into the distance.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/QYblQPTVUfnuIOxlgJP8lA?authkey=Gv1sRgCLmRuYfL4oL-5AE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S5QCoBSl_SI/AAAAAAAABz8/YgjEJlAPS6s/s800/IMG_6393.JPG" /></a><br />Matti leading the way.<br /><br />The beauty of winter is so apparent around us. The sun shining, we have smiles on our faces as we ski and walk through this great area. We come across different sorts of tracks, left during the previous night, and Matti takes out his book and we try to identify the tracks in the snow. As we come across the tracks of an Elk, I amazed at the vigor of this animal: Every step it breaks through the at least one meter high snow, and walking here must be take a lot of energy for it. <br /><br />Another short break with a camp fire, where I munch down my Ramen noodles, before we walk the last stretch to the road. We&#8217;re waiting for a while till the bus takes us in again; and driving back home my thoughts go back to the vast, white swamp area, glistering in the sunlight, the beautiful sunset, and I long for more. <br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/CJ2tI-Tw7f1o3BGgx9G8jQ?authkey=Gv1sRgCLmRuYfL4oL-5AE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S5QCo6WbsMI/AAAAAAAAB0A/i0JgAaZEXps/s800/IMG_6403.JPG" /></a><br />Elk tracks leading into the forest.</div>
