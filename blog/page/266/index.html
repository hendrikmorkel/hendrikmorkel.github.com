<span style="font-size:100%;">I left on Saturday morning as I wasn&#8217;t able to leave on Friday. I arrived punctually at the bus station and as soon as I entered the bus it started to rain, and it shouldn&#8217;t stop till six in the evening. The bus arrived in Parkano, from where I started to walk the 19 km to the National Park. After about three kilometers a car on the opposite lane stopped and asked me where I am going. I told the driver, and he told me to get in. He turned around, and the driver told me he saw me walking from the crossroad up ahead, and thought I could need a ride - lucky me! He dropped me off at the Visitor Centre and wished me a good trip. I quickly jumped in the Visitor Centre and asked about the lean-to shelter at Rysäslammi. The time was now 11.30 and I started walking, walking in the rain.<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2795.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2795.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2801.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2801.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2804.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2804.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2806.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2806.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br />Seiseminen consists of extensive forests, bogs and esker ridges, and there was also an old croft at Kovero on my path. I met one person during the whole trip in the park. It was peaceful, and only the rain and wind were accompanying me.<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2809.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2809.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2811.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2811.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2817.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2817.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2819.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2819.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2822.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2822.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br />I was making good speed on the park&#8217;s trails, and enjoyed the ups and downs and the walks over the planks, though they were slippery. A cuckoo was calling in the distance. I was still quite dry, walking mainly on broader paths under forest cover.<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2824.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2824.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2825.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2825.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2827.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2827.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br />The landscape changed every kilometer, and I saw moss (or do you call it dosh?) in many different shades of green.<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2829.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2829.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2836.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2836.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2837.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2837.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2842.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2842.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br />The path continued and I was in good spirit. I liked the fresh smell of the wet forest, and the silence. It was clean here. It was pristine nature.<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2853.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2853.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2846.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2846.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2854.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2854.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2859.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2859.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br />After about two hours I arrived at Koverolampi, where there is a campsite and a short walk of 200 meters to the croft. I put my backpack down under a fir and walked to shore of the small lake. It was swampy, and blueberry shrubs were all around. This will be a good place in the autumn to come and collect them.<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2870.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2870.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2874.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2874.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2878.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2878.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2879.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2879.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br />I shouldered my backpack and continued to the croft, where I met the only person during this trip, a daytripper. The old croft is a cultural heritage site, and I looked into the old stables and buildings before I continued my trip to Jokiristi. Part of the path was now a nature path, and some explanatory signs were standing at the side of the path.<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2894.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2894.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2898.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2898.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2904.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2904.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br />The anthill was as tall as me, 175 cm. I was amazed, it must be a old one. On that stretch of the path, there were another three right next to the path. The ants, however, were &#8220;inside&#8221; and waiting for the rain to stop. Smart ones, as the rain increased and the drops grew bigger. So big actually, that after about four hours I was rather wet. My spirit went down, and I decided to have a break and drink a hot chocolate. At Jokiristi they were building a new shelter, and I stopped in the not finished shelter to cook my hot cacao.<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2907.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2907.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br />Yes, that helped. With fresh energy I continued, as did the rain. I reached the old mill, which was very pretty and would make a good emergency shelter.<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2909.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2909.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2915.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2915.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2917.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2917.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br />Shortly after the battery died, and I didn&#8217;t have an extra pack with me. But my spirits were again high, and after passing Liesijärvi which had a great camping place I arrived at 18.00 o&#8217;clock at the Rysäslammin lean-to shelter. The fire in front of it was burning, and I suspect that the car which passed me five minutes earlier had the guys  within it which lighted it. I was wet to the bone after six and half hours in the rain, and needed a break. After cleaning the shelter - those guys had their beer cans and garbage thrown in the landscape - I set up the trusty Trangia and cooked me a delicious dinner. About half past seven the sun decided to show itself, and while I ate I enjoyed the view on the lake where a goose was swimming its circles.<br /><br />Not feeling comfortable with the shelter being so close to the forest-road, I decided to continue another 8 km to the next shelter. I arrived at it at 22 o&#8217;clock and made a fire to dry my cloths, before I slipped into the sleeping bag and was quickly asleep.<br /><br />At six in the morning the sun shone in my face, as my shelter was on top of a hill and facing slightly east. It was a beautiful morning, with a clear blue sky and no cloud to be seen. After breakfast I broke camp and continued the last 8 km to the town of Kuru, where I had a coffee and cake. The bus would leave in two hours, so I went down to the road to try to hitch a ride. After ten minutes I was on my way back home!<br /><br />All in all it where 35,5 km, of which the majority was the Pirkan-Taival trail. Its an European long distance trail, connecting Seitseminen NP to Helvetinjärvi NP and its well marked with good possibilities to camp. I think I will need to check it out during the summer, as its bound to have a route which starts or ends in Tampere!<br /></span></div>

<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">From my <a href="http://hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/2009/05/isojarvi-trip.html">recent trip</a> to Isojärvi National Park I present thee some more wildlife pictures and stories. There was no shortage of wildlife on this trip, and as I sat down this afternoon to remember all the impressions I decided to share some additional photos.<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&current=IMG_2622.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2622.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a><br />Frog spawn<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&current=IMG_2632.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2632.jpg" border="0" alt="Isoj&amp;auml;rvi"></a><br />Groupsex and a happy onlooker<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&current=IMG_2688.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2688.jpg" border="0" alt="Isoj&amp;auml;rvi"></a><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-throated_Diver">Black-throated Diver</a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&current=IMG_2778.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2778.jpg" border="0" alt="Isoj&amp;auml;rvi"></a><br />The first spring flowers<br /><br />These weren&#8217;t all, but I was too slow to snap pictures of the other animals. A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Pheasant">common pheasant</a> was seen while walking on the grit-road. A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Woodpecker">Black Woodpecker</a> I saw on my way to the Kalalahti lean-to shelter, its pecking sound was heard already way before I finally spotted it. The Black-throated Divers - there were two couples on the Kuorejärvi lake - has an incredible <a href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/b/blackthroateddiver/index.asp">call</a> and I was first thinking that an Elk must be in the forest across the lake - how wrong I was! They also had quite show going on after dawn, running two full circles in the water around the island and slapping their wings in the water. <br /><br />There were a few more birds I saw, but being far from a expert on birds I wasn&#8217;t able to identify them. However, I managed to <a href="http://www.allaboutfrogs.org/weird/general/frogtoad.html">distinguish</a> the frogs and toads. Toads are considered frogs, but there is the sub-species of the &#8220;true toad&#8221;. I saw a common toad which disappeared into its underground shelter as I approached, not even two meters from my sleeping place. All the frogs and toads showed that it was an amazingly healthy environment I was in, as they are considered a good indicator for an intact ecosystem.<br /><br />I already mentioned the two pike earlier. I heard an Owl at night, but am not able to tell which species. Thus all in all, quite a variety of wildlife for only two days out in the forest. Sure, there was nothing huge like an Elk (of which I saw two the weekend before, as I was fishing with my father-in-law in Vaasa) or rare like a lynx or bear, though I was happily surprised about the amount of wildlife I saw. I expect it will increase even during the following weeks, as spring turns to summer. Thus I hope to be able to snap some more photos of the wildlife here in Finland on my next trips, about which I will tell you soon more. </span></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">I got back already from Isojärvi (which means &#8220;Big Lake&#8221; in English), I planned to stay till tomorrow but some pain in my Achilles heel made me decide to come home already today. The trip was good. Isojärvi is a beautiful place, and it has three Lean-to shelters as well as a Rental Cabin with Sauna, so its well equipped for those folks without tent. <br /><br />I changed by plans a bit, and decided to go by bus to Kuhmoinen and then walk the 17 km to the National Park from there, then walk another few kilometers to the Kuorejärvi lean-to shelter and stay there for the night. I had a early start, and was walking at about 12.30 yesterday. However, those 17 km were boring grit-roads, so walking wasn&#8217;t to interesting. <br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&current=IMG_2619.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2619.jpg" border="0" alt="Isoj&amp;auml;rvi"></a><br /><br />Happily there were some nice spots along the way, as spring is just starting here in Finland so the Toads and Frogs were in love, and I also passed a nice old store and a bus stop which hasn&#8217;t seen much traffic lately. I also managed to snap some photos of some butterflies =) <br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&current=IMG_2637.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2637.jpg" border="0" alt="Isoj&amp;auml;rvi"></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&current=IMG_2634.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2634.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&current=IMG_2642.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2642.jpg" border="0" alt="Isoj&amp;auml;rvi"></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&current=IMG_2646.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2646.jpg" border="0" alt="Isoj&amp;auml;rvi"></a><br /><br />After around three hours I reached the National Park Info centre, and there were quite a few cars parked there. I started walking, and soon reached one of the first lakes, where I refilled by water bottle. As usually, I don&#8217;t use any filters or tablets, the water is very clean here and I am careful with the spots from where I pick my water. There was still some ice on the lake, too. <br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&current=IMG_2652.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2652.jpg" border="0" alt="Isoj&amp;auml;rvi"></a><br /><br />I reached my camp site after another hour, and started to look around the place a bit. <br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&current=IMG_2699.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2699.jpg" border="0" alt="Isoj&amp;auml;rvi"></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&current=IMG_2700.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2700.jpg" border="0" alt="Isoj&amp;auml;rvi"></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&current=IMG_2693.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2693.jpg" border="0" alt="Isoj&amp;auml;rvi"></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&current=IMG_2671.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2671.jpg" border="0" alt="Isoj&amp;auml;rvi"></a><br /><br />If you look closely on the last photo above, you&#8217;ll be able to see two pike next to each other. I saw those two &#8220;love birds&#8221; as I went to get water for cooking, and was surprised to see two tail fins almost jumping in my pot! My natural hunter instinct said &#8220;Take your knife and grab one by the neck!&#8221; though my environmentalist instinct said &#8220;Take the camera and snap some photos!&#8221;. I listened to the latter one. Those two were quite active the rest of the evening, splashing in the water close to the shore.<br /><br />I slept on the floor, on my Therm-A-Rest and a groundsheet, though I would have fit in the lean-to shelter. Just felt I wanted my privacy and not lie next to two strangers. There were some interesting bird calls during the evening, and they continued till near darkness. Lying comfortably warm in my sleeping bag, I was glad as it became a bit colder because so the few mosquitos also disappeared. <br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&current=IMG_2711.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2711.jpg" border="0" alt="Isoj&amp;auml;rvi"></a><br /><br />This morning I started early, made a fire to warm myself up a bit and had a good breakfast. At about nine I was on the road, and I passed some interesting sites. Isojärvi National Park is quite small, but it has three or four Nature trails, which overlapped with my chosen path at times. <br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&current=IMG_2718.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2718.jpg" border="0" alt="Isoj&amp;auml;rvi"></a> <br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&current=IMG_2727.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2727.jpg" border="0" alt="Isoj&amp;auml;rvi"></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&current=IMG_2745.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2745.jpg" border="0" alt="Isoj&amp;auml;rvi"></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&current=IMG_2756.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2756.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&current=IMG_2753.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2753.jpg" border="0" alt="Isoj&amp;auml;rvi"></a><br /><br />The frog (or is it a toad?) above probably didn&#8217;t hear me approach. Normally I could see them disappear way before I reached their location, its surprising me time and again how well they can feel the vibrations of an approaching person. At noon I reached the Kalalahti lean-to shelter, and a had a bit of lunch. This was the spot I was planning to stay for the night here, but didn&#8217;t feel like hanging around for 10 hours till its dark, so I continued to the exit and the 10 km to the village. All in all it were  43 km I reckon. <br /><br />Also close to Kalalahti was a beaver damn, and the underneath collection of mating frogs. It was quite a concert those fellows gave. And on the way back, there was one more toad which was trying not to let me pass =)<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&current=IMG_2768.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2768.jpg" border="0" alt="Isoj&amp;auml;rvi"></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&current=IMG_2775.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2775.jpg" border="0" alt="Isoj&amp;auml;rvi"></a><br /><br /></span></div>
