It is getting warmer here in Finland, yesterday we had 7°C and it was raining - reason enough for me to take out the <a href="http://inov-8.com/Products-Detail.asp?PG=PG1&L=26&P=5050973003">Inov-8 Roclite 295</a> from the cupboard and go for a run around Pyynikki, the green area behind my house. It was a great feeling to get rain on your face, it is a sign of spring and I am looking forward to the time when the snow is gone. <br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/XrAp3U-mEkPLRn48PBS_2Q?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S64ypUB3UII/AAAAAAAACAE/1_bcmfYDr8U/s800/inov-8%20Roclite%20295.jpg" /></a><br />Inov-8 Roclite 295 are great trail running and backpacking shoes - comfortable, light, breathable, and very grippy.<br /><br />I got the Roclite 295 as my spring till autumn backpacking shoes, and the pair is 602 g. If you have been lightning up during the winter months and got your base weight down to 10 kg or less, you might be ready to make the next step, and use lighter footwear like trailrunners for backpacking. The Roclite 295 is very comfortable, and the unique Inov-8 support system will hold your foot down and give you that great grip which you need on the trail. Lighter shoes mean less stress for your feet, walk in more comfort, and strengthen your feet and leg muscles. Considering that usually trekking boots are usually upwards of 800 g a boot, that is half a kilo less per foot when you use trail runners. <br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/ZvX9ja7gUgmrUhc3mD-Tsg?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S64yP3_jWDI/AAAAAAAAB_8/7oz8ioaZ1Qo/s800/P1030464.jpg" /></a><br />In the snow&#8230;<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/XstICV7eePZNRjYySs3eqQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S64yjToFQJI/AAAAAAAACAA/ycULEc2kebo/s800/P1030470.jpg" /></a><br />&#8230; and on wet rock - no slipping.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve been wearing my pair for my training runs and on a trip last autumn, and you&#8217;ll see them on my feet during the coming warmer months. They have no Goretex lining, I prefer breathability and quick drying shoes, and if it is wet - like yesterday and today - I wear my <a href="http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B002XEWIXI?ie=UTF8&tag=hikiinfinl-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1638&creative=6742&creativeASIN=B002XEWIXI">TrekMates Amphibian Socks</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.de/e/ir?t=hikiinfinl-21&l=as2&o=3&a=B002XEWIXI" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> and Voilá: Dry feet for 72 g. Multiuse and better than lined shoes, it is the way to go.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/MKE_Q25X87mY6dooBoxsww?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S64zI4oBE9I/AAAAAAAACAI/ercE7LfnUro/s800/P1030485.jpg" /></a><br />Front view of the Roclite 295.  <a href="http://inov-8.com/Find-Retailers-Countries.asp?L=26">Check the Inov-8 website for a Retailer near you</a>!</div>

Here and there I already mentioned that I am the fortunate owner of a new backpack, something very innovative, made by a UL cottage-in-stealth-mode from Germany, called LAUFBURSCHE. Here I want to present you a first look at this backpack, which is still a prototype but very close to the finished product which will go on sale during this summer. It is called the LAUFBURSCHE huckePACK.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/lQ4taPOvIqGa7Gk7OwPIkw?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6s_zVssQ2I/AAAAAAAAB-Q/rWrnfIEfU4E/s800/IMG_6146.JPG" /></a><br />UL awesomeness from Germany!<br /><br />I met the maker of the huckePACK during the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/2010/02/tufwt-10-trip-report.html">TUFWT 1.0</a> and could see for myself the packs in action. Mine above, packed with complete food and summer gear for an overnighter, has a 35 liter volume which can be expanded to 49 l thanks to the extendable collar. It is made of black silnylon, while the bottom is made of XPAC. <br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/l7FDrbmeWoROwu7yWlN-VQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6s-8WPN6XI/AAAAAAAAB90/z1IubrNN1_I/s800/IMG_6112.JPG" /></a><br />Front view. The front mesh pocket has plenty of space, and I can fit all my small stuff in there.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/3bC5YHZMdd1VKl1zpaFA0w?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6s_iq2ciQI/AAAAAAAAB-E/Bop7sWi6gJg/s800/IMG_6121.JPG" /></a><br />The lid. This is the most innovative lid I have seen thus far, and enables the pack to be nearly 100% waterproof. Check also the 3D shoulder strap.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Llwybg5dKrxRPXUajVjvWA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6s_nOg9bMI/AAAAAAAAB-I/I7ymsmWmjNQ/s800/IMG_6124.JPG" /></a><br />Backside. The shoulder straps are the most comfortable ones I have ever experienced, anatomically formed and of a very light yet durable material, 3D.<br /><br />The weight of this pack, which has removable trailpole holders, sternum strap, compression cordage, load lifters and much more, is 330 g. The craftsmanship is superb, &#8220;Quality Made in Germany&#8221; which doesn&#8217;t need to hide in comparison to established cottages. What I really like is that LAUFBURSCHE has used only the lightest components and best material available, without compromises. There is nothing fancy and extra, no big buckles or similar, only the smallest, lightest, highest quality material available. <br /><br />I used the huckePACK so far on small training trips, and it carries great; my summer kit fits in there with plenty of space to spare. This will be my go-to pack for probably all trips from summer till autumn. And before you ask: The LAUFBURSCHE huckePACK is not yet commercially available. You can check the as of the moment inactive <a href="http://www.laufbursche.blogspot.com">LAUFBURSCHE blog</a> (it should go life in a couple of weeks) about the upcoming launch of the cottage, which plans to offer the packs as a standard in black and grey silnylon as well as grey Dyneema X Gridstop, and other colours and materials will be as special wishes available. You&#8217;ll be able to see more of my huckePACK here in a couple of weeks in a video, when I will show you how to pack it, and what kind of Tardis it is!<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/y7UY6TP3kMsZP4eQqNxVdQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6tSJMmjtLI/AAAAAAAAB-0/gHiJStPry9A/s800/IMG_6133.JPG" /></a><br />Looking forward to summer backpacking!</div>

Like many who go backpacking, I pack bars - chocolate, cereal (or Müsli as we say in German) and variations thereof - for the time between breakfast and dinner. Usually I don&#8217;t bother with lunch, as I am too busy walking and taking photos, so my bars need to give me enough energy to walk for six to eight hours. So as the dedicate UL backpacker I am, I sat down, took the weight of the bars, listed their calories and fat and made a chart of it.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/9-Y7EK33ua1oh0jjTRBhCw?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6j2ABXne2I/AAAAAAAAB80/31zEL8gEKes/s800/P1030457.JPG" /></a><br />Nam nam!<br /><br />This was a fun exercise and definitely something different from the normal gist. It included me buying many, many different bars (which I would have needed either way =) and also doing some research, as not all of those bars list their calories and fat on the packaging. And often if they do, they do it for a 100 g bar, so it is distorted. Anyhow, here&#8217;s the chart I came up with:<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/_Q744X5x2IvoV9voJjS24Q?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6j2u9iiyFI/AAAAAAAAB9Q/F1sE-PUcPGU/s800/Screen%20shot%202010-03-23%20at%206.57.26%20PM.jpg" /></a><br />Click to see it bigger.<br /><br />Calories are in kilojoule (kJ). The most important column for you to look at is the &#8220;Calories to Weight Ratio&#8221; column, here I simply divided the calories of each bar by its weight (including packaging, I didn&#8217;t want to eat ten bars in one go). The higher this number, the better, as it means you get more calories per gram carried. There are some differences, though.<br /><br />The Biona, Fazer and Vegan Organica bars are chocolate bars, thus will give you pretty much an instant boost of energy, but not for long. If you need the energy divided over a longer amount of time, you might want to grab a Flapjack, Eat Natural, Suunita, Jannis or Rapunzel bar. And then you got the nakd and Trek bars, who are at the lower end of the calories to weight ratio, but have more of that energy which will go into your system over time. <br /><br />If you divide the price column and compare it with the calories to weight ratio, you also can see which bar gives you the most energy for your money. That I have done here: <br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Jkfu4x49Q4dnfR7-inMn1g?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6j7zmW7eGI/AAAAAAAAB9U/H54C2QWr4s8/s800/Screen%20shot%202010-03-23%20at%207.34.40%20PM.jpg" /></a><br />The smaller the number in the &#8220;Price to Calories to Weight Ratio&#8221; column, the better.<br /><br />The clear winners here are the Fazer chocolate bar and the Jannis Sesame with Honey bar, who both are 0,60€. While the Sunita bars are the clear winners if it comes to calories to weight, they are double the price of one Jannis bar, so I usually take the Jannis, who are also very tasty. Speaking of taste, you will see that there&#8217;s a lot of coconut there, I really like coco so it is usually what I like to take along for a trip. But there&#8217;s a wide variety of different flavours available for most of the listed bars, so you likely would find something to suit your taste (I like them all, otherwise I wouldn&#8217;t buy them). And besides the Fazer and Jannis bar, all others are either Fair Trade, Vegan, Soil Association or similar approved, so you can snack with a good conscience. <br /><br />Here a list of links to the websites of the manufacturers, often with the possibility to order a box of the bars, as well as some subjective comments from me about the taste. Worth to check out, especially for the UK readers (somehow a whole bunch of those companies are from the UK!).<br /><br /><a href="http://rjfoods-flapjack.com/">Flapjacks</a>: They&#8217;re like a meal, seriously. I often can only eat half of them in one go, so these are basically for me two bars in one. Tasty and in a lot of different flavours. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.naturalbalancefoods.co.uk/store/trek/default.aspx">Trek</a>: Good but expensive, at least here in Finland. Given their low calories to weight ratio score, I probably won&#8217;t buy these anymore.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.venturefoods.com/">Vegan Organica</a>: I love these. I carry one for every day I go out with me, and savour every bite. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.eatnatural.co.uk/View-Products.aspx?Category=EatNaturalBars">Eat Natural</a>: Very nice and fruity, with many different flavours. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.windmillorganics.com/brandcat-28-12.html">Biona</a>: Another one of those awesome coconut bars. I usually take the Vegan Organica ones though, as they&#8217;re a bit cheaper.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.guardianecostore.co.uk/products/sunita/sunita-organic-sultana-sesame-bar-30g/">Sunita</a>: I like Sesame, its very tasty, and if you&#8217;re looking for the most calories per gram, this is your go-to bar.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.jannis.gr/en/products_det.asp?product_id=17">Jannis</a>: Cheap and tasty, I usually always have one per day with me. <br /><br /><a href="http://rapunzel.de/">Rapunzel</a>: Great energy provider, good taste. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.datahotelli.com/fazermakeiset/tuotetiedot/en/?productId=&brandId=&productGroupCode=5100&searchTerm=&ingrTable=&specialDiet=">Fazer</a>: From Finland, many different, great flavours, cheap, and tasty quick energy.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.naturalbalancefoods.co.uk/store/nakd/default.aspx">nakd</a>: They&#8217;re good, but otherwise they have a low energy to weight ratio and are expensive. Probably not going to buy these again.<br /><br />Yeps, I hope this was also an interesting excursion for you, and helped you to see where you might be able to save weight in the food department. Taking lightweight, high calorie bars for the trail is the way to go in my opinion.  We often fuss around how we can save 100 g for our tarp by taking it in Cuben, when cheap and easy savings can be made with very basic items like these presented here. I hope it inspires you to have a look at the food you carry!</div>
