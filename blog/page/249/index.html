  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">The week started with an <a href="http://hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/2009/10/interview-henry-shires-from-tarptent.html">interview of US cottage manufacturer Henry Shires from Tarptent</a>, so what better way to close the week to interview one of Germany&#8217;s foremost UL backpackers, Carsten Jost - better know to many by his Trailname of &#8220;Sauerkraut&#8221;. Carsten writes his own blog <a href="http://fastpacking.de/wordpress/">Fastpacking</a> (in German), and he (nearly) thru-hiked this year the <a href="http://www.luontoon.fi/page.asp?Section=8300">Nordkalottleden</a>. So without any more of my drivel, here&#8217;s the interview!<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/_Ou0MxTipPew8bygF3flqw?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/SunTOhZEz9I/AAAAAAAAAwA/XQJLb5ELKKg/s800/Carsten_03.jpg" /></a><br />Goat Rocks Wilderness on the Pacific Crest Trail.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Carsten, could you tell a bit about yourself for those who don&#8217;t know you or your blog? Where are you from, when did you start backpacking?</span><br /><br />I&#8217;m from Germany and happen to live in the Allgäu region close to the Alpes which is a blessing if you are interested in outdoor sports in any form. I was pretty fortunate that I started backpacking pretty early when I joined the boy scouts at the age of 7. Scouts really use old traditional gear that really sucks even if you compare it to the new traditional stuff that is available in outdoor stores nowadays. The good thing is that if you use gear that is not really good you always have to have a Plan B. You have to be a problem solver and being able to adjust to situations. Not by using the coolest newest gear but with common sense and proper techniques.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">When and why did you adopt your UL philosophy, of packing light and going fast?</span><br /><br />Appalachian Trail here I come! On my first long-distance hike in 2004 I found out that I didn´t know everything there is to know about trekking even though I had thought that before I started the trail. Most hikers were definitely not as experienced as I was but still managed to stay alive with a lot less weight on their shoulders and flimsy looking gear. I basically had all the weird prejudices against UL gear that you can have. But after having hiked a couple of hundred kilometers and seeing that UL-gear worked for everybody around me it made me thinking wether I was just a stupid ignorant German, which I probably was :-) And honestly, once you felt the benefits of hiking UL, there is no turning back. It just makes sense.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">You hiked both the Appalachian Trail and the Pacific Crest Trail. You announced a while ago that you&#8217;re aiming for the Triple Crown and want to walk the Continental Divide Trail as well. When do you think it is so far, and how are you preparing yourself for it?</span><br /><br />The triple crown is not something you do because you want to have the triple crown. It&#8217;s something you can&#8217;t hide from if you did the other two already. It&#8217;s a force that pulls you and from my perspective there is something wrong with you if you can withdraw yourself from the call of the trail. You have to do it sooner or later. I had the plan to hike the CDT in 2011 but life is changing ever and always and so I don&#8217;t have a definite date right now. But the trail is calling and one day I WILL hike the CDT.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Qc7eOBdagVMeC0JFWjj2mg?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/SunTO2gUhoI/AAAAAAAAAwE/P_NWFYOBEns/s800/Carsten_02.JPG" /></a><br />On he Nordkalottleden.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">This year in September you did a thru-hike of the Nordkalottleden, starting in Norway and walking through Finland till you finished 800 km later in Sweden. Could you tell a bit about that experience? Was it your first time hiking in Lapland?</span><br /><br />Technically I didn&#8217;t thruhike the Nordkalottleden but &#8220;just&#8221; hiked from Kautokeino to Kvikkjokk. On the last stage I changed the route due to really bad weather. Instead of hiking the last 170km on the Nordkalottleden I hiked 140km on the Patjalantaleden. I had 15-20cm of snow and it kept snowing with gusty winds. As the Nordkalottleden is rougher than the other established trails in Lappland and higher in elevation than the Patjalantaleden I opted for the safer route. It was my first time in Lappland but I want to go back :-)<br /><br /><object width="480" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/WzSaSW4gxok&hl=en&fs=1&color1=0x234900&color2=0x4e9e00"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/WzSaSW4gxok&hl=en&fs=1&color1=0x234900&color2=0x4e9e00" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object><br />A short Video from the Beginning of the Nordkalottleden, and an unwanted pursuer!<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">You&#8217;re one of the leading UL backpackers in the German scene. What kind of advice would you give to someone who thinks about going UL?</span><br /><br />That sounds funny :-) I&#8217;m definitely one of the few fortunate German hikers that have the gut to take time off to realize their dreams. The hardest part of long-distance-hiking and probably going UL as well is just overcoming your fears and facing the unknown. Being open to new ideas and trying things to find out if it works for you is key.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Where do you think UL backpacking will go in the future? Will it become mainstream or will it always be something that only a select few will practice?</span><br /><br />I don&#8217;t think that UL will become mainstream. I went UL out of necessity and got hooked by the positive effects. It is much harder to go light if necessity is not a driving force. I totally think that most hikers would be better off with light gear but it is up to everybody himself to develop his or her own gear philosophy. What I wanted to say with this is simple &#8220;Hike your own hike&#8221;.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Finally, lets talk some gear. What are your favourite pieces of gear at the moment?</span><br /><br />As Lappland just kicked my butt big time and my gear helped me to work through the harsh conditions I come up with three products I really like:<br /><br />GG Mariposa Plus : Even though I will retire this pack after being on trails with it for 5000km it´s been my pack of choice.<br />Thermarest Neo Air short: Comfy and light.<br />Mammut Borah DLX: It was not the perfect shoe for the conditions I was in, but the shoe is definitely worth looking at if the terrain is a little more rugged than the normal long-distance-hike.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/w0m79Zpsq1ZkSA3tvLRZBw?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/SunTPtgq92I/AAAAAAAAAwI/1oNVHFkOmhY/s800/Carsten_01.jpg" /></a><br />Appalachian Trail.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Carsten, I thank you for your time. Do you have any wise words for the end?</span><br /><br />Overcome your fears. Hiking long-distance-trails and experiencing the freedom and flexibility that UL-gear will offer is so rewarding. I went UL for the last approximately 10.000km and I´m not going to change. That alone should make you start thinking wether you should give UL a try.<br /><br /><a href="http://technorati.com/faves?sub=addfavbtn&amp;add=http://www.hikinginfinland.blogspot.com"><img src="http://static.technorati.com/pix/fave/tech-fav-1.png" alt="Add to Technorati Favorites" /></a></span></div>

  <div class="entry-content">Together with looking for a <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2009/09/gear-talk-golite-ultra-20-initial-review.html">tarp</a>, I&#8217;m also in need of a bivy bag to keep the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/2009/09/gear-talk-golite-ultra-20-initial.html">Ultra 20°</a> dry from rain and dampness and increase the warmth rating of the quilt a bit. <br>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7381684016/" title="A bike and a bivy. by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8148/7381684016_5aefe0f5e9_o.jpg" width="4912" height="3264" alt="A bike and a bivy."></a>
<br>
I had a look around, and these are the bags I found which would suit my needs. The bivy doesn&#8217;t need to be water resistant as I will be under the tarp, so waterproof is enough (I don&#8217;t water resistance, though =). It should have good breathability and be light. Pretty much the standards, thus. Use is spring till autumn and in winter to increase the rating. Here the ones I am considering:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.titaniumgoat.com/Bivy.html">Titanium Goat Ptarmigan bivy</a><br />- 164 g in Intrepid/ Silnylon<br />- Mosquito netting, no zipper<br />- 90$<br /><br /> <a href="http://www.rab.uk.com/equipment/bivvis/ultra_bivi---70/">Rab Ultra Bivy</a><br />- 220 g in Pertex Quantum Endurance<br />- short zipper<br />- 65€<br /><br /><a href="http://www.integraldesigns.com/product_detail.cfm?id=821&CFID=1161559&CFTOKEN=57196832&mainproducttypeid=1">Integral Design Micro Bivy</a><br />- 535 g in eVent/ 70 denier coated nylon<br />- hood & draw cord, no zipper<br />- 210$<br /><br /><a href="http://www.mountainlaureldesigns.com/shop/product_info.php?cPath=22&products_id=39&osCsid=16ae04d23cde8a116479ca7d73e31cab">MLD LiteSoul Bivy</a><br />- 125 g in Momentum/ Spectralite .60<br />- no mosquito net, dual zipper<br />- 245$<br /><br /><a href="http://www.mountainlaureldesigns.com/shop/product_info.php?cPath=22&products_id=37&osCsid=16ae04d23cde8a116479ca7d73e31cab">MLD Soul Bivy</a><br />- 195 g in Momentum DWR/ Silnylon<br />- bug netting window, two sets of inside and outside sleep pad strap loops, top can be made in eVent<br />- 205$<br />- I also can imagine the <a href="http://www.mountainlaureldesigns.com/shop/product_info.php?cPath=22&products_id=38&osCsid=1ae63005ffeaf98b41fc0cf1ebca5d7f">Soul Bivy with a side zip</a><br /><br />I know there&#8217;s heaps more out there, and even a MYOG Tyvek bivy, like eg <a href="http://theotherface.wordpress.com/2009/03/11/myog-tyvek-bivy/">The Other Face</a> has made, would be sufficient for my needs, though somehow I prefer to get it in slightly more durable material. As this is again a fairly new topic to me, I am curious to hear which bivy you use.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">In an effort to understand what drives cottage manufacturers, on which we UL backpackers rely for a huge part for our equipment, I decided to ask a few of my favourite companies if they would be willing to participate in an interview and answer my questions. The idea is to show how they started out, what drives them and who the people behind the company are. The first in this series is Henry Shires from <a href="http://www.tarptent.com/">Tarptent</a>. A week after you were able to see some photos of the new <a href="http://hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/2009/10/new-scarp-1.html">Scarp 1</a>, Henry will answer my questions and tell us about the future of Tarptent. So without further ado, here is the Henry Shires interview:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Henry, since when are you backpacking, and how did you start? How often are you out backpacking nowadays?</span><br /><br />I started backpacking at age 11 or 12. My parents signed me up for a week-long hiking trip for kids in Yosemite National Park. I hated the hiking part&#8211;it was another year or two before I started to like hiking&#8211;but loved the high mountain destination lakes and snowfields.  Over the years I have spent a lot of time hiking here in the US and have had the privilege of hiking in Canada, New Zealand, the UK, Italy, and Nepal. There are a lot more places I&#8217;m anxious to hike but between business and family I struggle to find extended blocks of hiking time.  These days I manage to get out for several hikes a year but limited to a week or two at a time.  In 2010, I&#8217;m looking forward to doing the TGO Challenge in Scotland.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/mdyWc8Y9dj1N3965VMfOsA?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/SuQJYbOO81I/AAAAAAAAAt4/YPZBCRFrlDM/s800/henry_CDT.jpg" /></a><br />Henry on the Continental Divide Trail in 2008, Southwest Colorado.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">When and why did you start to go lightweight/ UL?<br /></span><br />When I hiked the Pacific Crest Trail in 1999, I made a big change in gear and hiking philosophy.  For that hike, I bought a sewing machine and made some of my own gear because I could not find commercial products that were light enough for my needs.  Once of those pieces of gear was a lightweight tarp with attached bug netting. That shelter ultimately started me on the tent-making path I&#8217;m on now.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Already since a few years you are making a name for yourself with Tarptent. Can you tell a bit more about how you started the company, and how it developed over time?<br /></span><br />Shortly before I left on my Pacific Crest Trail hike, I published a webpage with plans for making the original tarptent. When I came back from the hike I updated the page and began to get emails from hikers wondering if I would make a tarptent for sale. In those days I forwarded those requests off to a friend&#8217;s sewing company and went on with my life. Then, the following summer, my wife took the tarptent on a hike with friends and came home complaining that it was too hard to set up. So, in an effort to make her happy, I went about trying to improve the original design. I thought it would take me a weekend but it took months before I settled on what would later become the original &#8220;Virga&#8221; (and larger &#8220;Squall&#8221;). By then I had invested quite a bit of effort and decided to try to recoup my investment by getting a few of them made&#8211;I hired a friend&#8217;s sister to do the sewing&#8211;and selling them direct on a new website called &#8220;tarptent.com&#8221;  I honestly thought that there would be a market for perhaps 50 of them and that would be the end of it. Long story short, demand far exceeded my ability to produce and it was several years before I found real manufacturing and was able to make enough product to mostly keep up with demand.<br /><br />In the early days, I really had no idea how to design. I knew nothing about computer aided design (CAD) and only had very primitive computer programs that were ok for flat line drawing and not much else. The product line grew very slowly as I acquired better tools and learned how to design. Now I use advanced CAD tools and have learned a lot about design just by doing it over all these years. Design is hard, at least good design is hard, and I try to design tents that have not been done before. The thrill of designing something new and better is really what keeps me going.<br /><br />We have doubled our product line over the last year. We can&#8217;t keep going at that pace in 2010 but I do expect to slowly add more models as well as refine the ones we have now.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/iuKvdZMThUs7NZ3oLOALtw?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/SuQ3wuKADBI/AAAAAAAAAus/gNTbVzxEnaA/s800/henry_stuart.jpg" /></a><br />Henry with his son Stuart - the next generation Tarptent genius!<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Your newest creations, the Moment and the improved Scarp 1, were very well received. Can you tell us what is the most popular Tarptent? And from where do your customers come?<br /></span><br />Over the last year or two, the Contrail has been our biggest seller. I think the popularity is due to a combination of simplicity, pack size, weight, space, and price&#8211;not necessarily in that order&#8211;and there really isn&#8217;t anything on the market that hits that combination quite as well. The Moment is our latest shelter, and one of which I&#8217;m quite proud, but is only just on the market (and quickly sold out) so it remains to be seen how well it will do in the long term. The Scarp 1 in another design that I&#8217;m quite proud of but it is in a very different class than the Contrail, especially price and weight, so we don&#8217;t sell nearly as many of those as we do the Contrail. The revised Scarp 1 (out next month) will, I think, be more popular than the first generation model especially with our customers outside the US looking for more robust shelters for use in harsher climates.<br /><br />We sell all over the world but the US and Canada are certainly our primary markets. We have a growing market in Europe&#8211;it fluctuates somewhat with exchange rates&#8211;and another one in Australia/New Zealand. Asia, South America, and Africa are much smaller markets for us as I imagine they are for other tent companies as well.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">What kind of new innovations can we expect in the next years from you?<br /></span><br />If I knew the answer to that question, life would be much easier. Innovation is more perspiration than anything else. Design for me happens very organically and usually as a result of banging my head against a concept or concepts for a long time. Sometimes I just push existing designs to see what else pops out. The Moment happened that way (out of the Scarp 1 which happened out of seeing what I could do with a foldable corner support). Other times I try to make support structures out of trekking poles and one or more other poles and see what happens: Squall 2 and Rainbow happened that way. Materials innovations are not something I control but certainly we&#8217;re all waiting for advancements and I will use new materials as performance/ratios improve. Long story short, all I can say is that I&#8217;ll keep working at it and, with luck and lots of hard work, new things will take shape. I can also say that I could not imagine doing what I do without CAD. It allows me to think in ways that would otherwise not be possible.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/i8UbJt7YjVmJZCQYg4eHQA?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/SuQJX8iJT3I/AAAAAAAAAt0/ORI7itbElNE/s800/tarptentoffice.jpg" /></a><br />The Tarptent office and workshop with a few Moments set up on the grass.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">What is your own favorite tarptent? Did you make it yourself?<br /></span><br />Whatever I&#8217;ve worked on most recently is the generic answer to that question. For general 3-season use, I will using the Moment going forward. I don&#8217;t use trekking poles so, for me, it&#8217;s the perfect combination of quick setup, space, and weather protection and I&#8217;m willing to pay the small weight penalty over our other models that use trekking poles.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">You were hiking this summer in Washington state. What was your baseweight, and which pieces of your gear did you make yourself?<br /></span><br />Honestly, I didn&#8217;t weigh my pack so I don&#8217;t know. I did take the Moment as well as my favorite homemade piece of gear: a down quilt.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Do you think ultralight backpacking will become more popular and break into the mass market, or will it continue to be something for a small group of people?<br /></span><br />I think there is a general industry trend toward lighter weight gear. Given a choice between a 5-lb tent and 3-lb tent, both of which do the same thing and cost the same amount, consumers will generally choose the lighter tent. However, I don&#8217;t think any of the larger, mainstream companies will push completely into the ultralight realm because costs really start to go up when dealing with very light, high price fabrics like silnylon, spinnaker, cuben etc. And when large companies do foray into really light gear, their retail price points go far above what the cottage gear makers can do. Nearly all the mainstream companies manufacture offshore in order to sell retail so making things as cheaply as possible drives the business directions for most companies. &#8220;Mass Market&#8221; means mass production and mass retail marketing and that&#8217;s a whole different business model. The smaller companies, like Tarptent, sell direct and have very low overhead so we can afford to use lighter, higher priced fabrics and still keep the finished products somewhat competitive with retail price points. The downside of the &#8220;niche&#8221; market approach for us is that our volumes will always be much lower but I do think there&#8217;s room in the ecosystem for both approaches and the customer ultimately benefits.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Is the cottage industry cooperating &#8220;behind the scenes&#8221; with each other? Are you for example in touch with Ron Bell from MLD, Brian Frankle of ULA or any of the other small manufacturers, and talking about developments and the like?<br /></span><br />I don&#8217;t know Ron Bell personally&#8211;we have exchanged an email or two&#8211;but Brian Frankle is a friend as are other &#8220;cottage gear&#8221; founders and, yes, we do talk about manufacturing, problem customers, materials sources etc. I really enjoy my fellow gearmakers and there&#8217;s a real camaraderie among us.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Henry, I thank you for taking the time to answer my questions. Is there something you would like to add?<br /></span><br />Thanks for your blog. I read yours and others and learn a lot. Sitting here in an office a great deal of the time is otherwise pretty isolating and blogs such as yours are a great way to keep in touch with what the industry is doing and how customers are reacting.<br /><br /><a href="http://technorati.com/faves?sub=addfavbtn&amp;add=http://www.hikinginfinland.blogspot.com"><img src="http://static.technorati.com/pix/fave/tech-fav-1.png" alt="Add to Technorati Favorites" /></a></span></div>
