It is July, summer is in full swing and there is a lot going on in the lightweight and UL community. The weather is perfect here in Finland, long, sunny and hot days - I hope to go out on a trip soon. <br /><br /><embed src="http://media1.nfb.ca/medias/flash/ONFflvplayer-gama.swf" width="516" height="337" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="mID=IDOBJ348&image=http://media1.nfb.ca/medias/nfb_tube/thumbs_large/2008/787_5TVBIG.jpg&width=516&height=337&showWarningMessages=false&streamNotFoundDelay=15&lang=en&getPlaylistOnEnd=true&embeddedMode=true"></embed><br /><br />It is Sunday noon, so before you go and watch the above movie make yourself a cup of tea, some sandwiches and take some cookies along as you will not want to interrupt the one hour movie. It is about <a href="http://www.nfb.ca/film/Cesars_Bark_Canoe/">how to build a birch bark canoe</a>, the old way. No spoken words mean you just can enjoy looking and taking in the sounds. Fantastic.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/4JNz7guJkj1CN4KrcCRX-3ZMP1PuexCSr-lw5bI3W3A?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S5QCha8TN7I/AAAAAAAABzc/hVVgkuerdYk/s800/IMG_6244.JPG" /></a><br /><br />Talking trip reports, Gustav found the time to write his view on our Vålådalen trip, and he has some fantastic photos in his <a href="http://thebearablelightness.blogspot.com/2010/07/scandinavian-blogger-meetup-2010-trip.html">trip report</a> and also is able to name all the streams and mountains!<br /><br />Wondering what it feels like to walk on the Pacific Crest Trail? Check out Keith&#8217;s <a href="http://keithfoskett.blogspot.com/2010/06/gomez-meadow-i-struggled-to-stop-in.html">thoughts on Gomez Meadow</a> or why he feels guilty to be walking. <br /><br />So what is the perspective of someone from the UK (or Scotland!) to go hiking in the Nordics? That is what Jörgen asked <a href="http://www.fjaderlatt.se/2010/07/scandinavia-end-to-end-with-townsend.html">Chris Townsend, who walked the Scandinavian spine</a> twenty years ago. Go have a read of this great article.<br /><br />Caro & Tomie were preparing for the Fjällräven Classic with <a href="http://www.cathohi.de/home/2010/06/jurasteig-55km-vorbereitung-fur-die-fjallraven-classics">a walk on the Jurasteig</a>, and their superb photos show that one doesn&#8217;t always need to travel far to enjoy nice scenery.<br /><br />James shows us the lush green hills and the blue sea around <a href="http://backpackingbongos.wordpress.com/2010/07/03/beinn-na-croise-isle-of-mull/">Beinn na Croise on the Isle of Mull</a> and reminds us to eat fish and chips only there where you&#8217;re save from seagulls!<br /><br />Michelle shares with us her trip on the <a href="http://freespirittraveler.blogspot.com/2010/06/mount-seymour-dog-mountain-trail.html">Dog Mountain Trail on Mount Seymour</a>, and the photos look like they could come right out of Tolkien book - Magic!<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/ewCSO9gChD9lJOliR9-6tADlCYIKAPW8x6Ga1mQZ8IM?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/Sriqhikvc8I/AAAAAAAAAfY/GaI1AtPO8lE/s800/Mist_02.JPG" /></a><br /><br />Gear, one thing that sent ripples through the German UL community was <a href="http://trekking-ultraleicht.de/forum/viewthread.php?forum_id=2&thread_id=1212">LAUFBURSCHE&#8217;s XUL packing list</a> with a Full Skin Out - Base Weight of 2268g. What is really fantastic about this list is that the majority of items are MYOG and thus LAUFBURSCHE knows pretty well where the limits of this list are. Great, inspiring stuff!<br /><br />Shed Dweller shares his <a href="http://sheddwellersmoments.blogspot.com/2010/06/lakes-sul-trip-few-thoughts.html">thoughts on the gear</a> he used on his recent (S)UL trip to the Lakes, so if you wonder if it is possible to go so light and still be safe and comfortable, please have a look.<br /><br />Thomas shares his <a href="http://goinglighter.blogspot.com/2010/06/first-impression-ti-caldera-keg-h.html">initial impressions on the Ti Caldera Keg-H</a> with us, and for everyone who fancies cooking with a beer can and a woodfire this is required reading.<br /><br />If you prefer titanium pots for cooking with a wood fire on the other hand, have a look at <a href="http://thunderinthenight.blogspot.com/2010/07/four-dog-stoves-bushcooker-lt1-stove.html">Joe&#8217;s first look at the Bushcooker LT1</a> (and also at the accompanying <a href="http://thunderinthenight.blogspot.com/2010/06/not-risk-another-frontal-assault-that.html">Evernew Titanium Pasta Pot review</a>!), which is something to consider if you want to go (S)UL.<br /><br />Nibe, who walks in the Dutch mountains (!) shares his <a href="http://inthedutchmountains.blogspot.com/2010/06/last-weekend-part-one-gear.html">thoughts on his gear from his last trip</a>, and it is interesting for all those who are lightening up and trying lightweight gear one step at the time.<br /><br />Showing that 24h trips and lightweight/ UL gear are not exclusive to backpackers, we here see that <a href="http://vintageone.blogspot.com/2010/07/s24o-with-jeffj-and-ted.html">Sub 24hour Overnighters with lightweight gear</a> are also common in the cycling community. <br /><br />And in case you haven&#8217;t yet read my <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/06/gossamer-gear-spinntwinn-review-video.html">Gossamer Gear SpinnTwinn review</a> and video, please go and have a look if you&#8217;re in the market for a tarp!<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/IDKXgLkU_UuFPLPizZ67X3ZMP1PuexCSr-lw5bI3W3A?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S5QCjNNKx9I/AAAAAAAABzo/aSOojrNoANw/s800/IMG_6328.JPG" /></a><br /><br />If you forget your pot on a trip in the future but don&#8217;t want to go without your cup of tea or a hot meal, check out Nick&#8217;s <a href="http://www.skillsforwildlives.com/2010/07/boiling-water-in-a-birch-bark-container/">how to boil water in a birch bark container</a>, learn the skills and in future you can go without your titanium pot hiking, saving another 100 g.<br /><br />Japan has a very active UL scene, and some very worthy note-worthy Shops: <a href="http://locusgear.com/">Locus Gear</a>, <a href="http://moonlight-gear.com/">Moonlight Gear</a> and the <a href="http://ulgstore.exblog.jp/">ulgear weekend store</a>. While Locus Gear is a cottage manufacturer and a shop, the last two are dedicated UL shops. I really like the layout of Moonlight Gear, it is beautiful! ulgear weekend store on the other hand is a a shop and blog, and the owner always makes very interesting posts with lots of photos - often from cottage gear! So if you&#8217;re located in Japan and need some new UL toys, support these shops!<br /><br />The <a href="http://hrxxlight.com/?p=247">view into LAUFBURSCHE&#8217;s workshop</a> which Benjamin gave us already wetted the appetite of the up coming launch of the company. Bets are being made how many hours it will take that the company will be sold out of its initial stock after opening - if you want to take part, leave a comment here with your guess ;) <br /><br />And by now you know that I love Japan. It was thus with gusto that I read Hamilton&#8217;s latest article, Which asks &#8221;<a href="http://traversejapan.wordpress.com/2010/07/03/do-you-need-permission-to-play-outside/">Do You Need Permission to Enjoy Nature?</a>&#8221; and is a absolute fantastic piece, which showcases how different our (backpacking) cultures are. For everyone who is hiking in Japan or by the tiniest bit interested in the country a must read.<br /><br /><a href="http://flattr.com/thing/985/Hiking-in-Finland-Ultralight-Backpacking-Blog" target="_blank"><img src="http://api.flattr.com/button/button-compact-static-100x17.png" title="Flattr this" border="0" /></a></div>

Midsummer was this weekend (and the longest day aka summer solstice was last Monday) so now here up north we slowly edge again towards the dark and cold time of the year, winter. Time to think about the winter setup and procure the winter tent and stove, build a rulk and get the 3 meter long forest skis. But until then I&#8217;ll try and find the time to do a couple of summer hikes.<br /><br /><object width="800" height="440"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=6686768&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=ff9933&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=6686768&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=ff9933&amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="800" height="440"></embed></object><br /><br />Nick from Skills for Wild Lives has a great post titled &#8221;<a href="http://www.skillsforwildlives.com/2010/06/simplify-or-die/">Simplify of Die</a>&#8221; which I urge you to read. It&#8217;s about UL & lightweight backpacking, bushcraft, and the environment - excellent read.<br /><br />Hamilton asks <a href="http://traversejapan.wordpress.com/2010/06/23/114/">how many Dollars (or Euros or Yen or Pound) it takes to lighten your pack</a>, and it is worth reading if you plan to go lighter.<br /><br />In the MYOG vein Mungo injected some fresh ideas, as he makes a <a href="http://www.mungosaysbah.com/2010/06/tyvek-fedex-pouch-converted-to-camping.html">stuff sack out of a FedEx tyvek envelope</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/jFJD5nkwH7KesWI4_oosfzWiupv70N-RGKSfyQFBX78?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TBukH6xr-GI/AAAAAAAACzk/aWwNZbe5xPw/s800/P1040331.jpg" /></a><br /><br />Under gear which was reviewed last week we find the <a href="http://www.fjaderlatt.se/2010/06/tn-laser-photon-light-and-not-half-bad.html">Terra Nova Laser Photon review</a> by Jörgen Johansson, which is still one of the lightest double skin tents on the market.<br /><br />Roman has a <a href="http://lighthiker.wordpress.com/2010/06/25/first-look-katabaticgear-palisade-quilt/">first look at the Katabatic Gear Palisade quilt</a>, which is revolutionizing the quilt market quite a bit.<br /><br />Fraser has a review of <a href="http://mcalisterium.wordpress.com/2010/06/21/whisky-the-perfect-in-camp-drink/">the perfect in-camp drink, Whisky</a>. He obviously hasn&#8217;t yet tasted Minttu cacao!<br /><br />Andy Howell reviewed his <a href="http://www.andyhowell.info/trek-blog/2010/06/23/tgo-challenge-gear-review/">TGO Challenge gear</a>, which is very useful for those who think about participating in the event in the future.<br /><br />Peter from PTC has another <a href="http://www.petesy.co.uk/gear-diary-10/">Gear Diary post</a> up, and considering the amount of time I have to do reviews at the moment this might be a smart format for all the stuff I have flying around. Anyhow, go read his!<br /><br />Over on sectionhiker there is a nice review of the <a href="http://sectionhiker.com/inov-8-roclite-260-trail-runners-for-women/">Women&#8217;s Inov-8 Roclite 260</a> which should be of interest for the ladies as well as the husbands who aim to get their partners outdoors!<br /><br />Finally, Mark tested his new <a href="http://backpackingnorth.blogspot.com/2010/06/bushbuddy-garden-test.html">BushBuddy Ultra in the garden</a>, and his Nipsu cup is just awesome!<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/beSVV7e2tMMYheDUF-j7eTWiupv70N-RGKSfyQFBX78?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TBzSW0UUPwI/AAAAAAAAC0Q/Rm8aAmTifNI/s800/IMG_0575.JPG" /></a><br /><br />Lots of interesting trip reports this week. Matias Hyde, who is planning to cycle around the world (or part of it!) and sketch while doing so, made a <a href="http://www.matiashydetravels.com/2010/06/the-way-of-st-james-days-8-to-10/">trip along the Way of St. James</a> and it looks like he took the less busy route. Nice photos though Matias could learn a few things about lightweight traveling ;)<br /><br />Hamilton from Traverse Japan went on his <a href="http://traversejapan.wordpress.com/2010/06/21/training-hike-3-reasons-to-hike-when-it-rains/">third training hike</a>, in which he embraced the rainy season of Japan.<br /><br />Geoff from Backpacking in Britain went on a three day trip along the <a href="http://v-g.me.uk/Trips/G0072/G0072.htm">Upper Wye Hills</a>, an area which looks lovely in the sunshine.<br /><br />Roam The Hills posted <a href="http://roamthehills.blogspot.com/2010/06/kilimanjaro-shira-route-day-2-simba-one.html">Part 2 of the Kilimanjaro Shira Route hike</a> he did in 2008, worth your time.<br /><br />James from Backpackingbongos wrote down his <a href="http://backpackingbongos.wordpress.com/2010/06/20/meanderings-on-magical-mull/">meanderings on magical Mull</a> accompanied by some sweet photos. <br /><br />And <a href="http://www.deanread.net/weblog/pivot/entry.php?id=347">Dean Read&#8217;s Great Gable Wild Camp in the Lake District</a>, now that is again one of those posts which wants me to go backpacking in the UK. <br /><br />Japan is represented again as Hana and her owner ascent <a href="http://hana2009.wordpress.com/2010/06/24/amagoidake-雨乞岳/">Amagoidake</a>.<br /><br />Finally, if you have followed Michael then you already know that he <a href="http://freiwildontour.blogspot.com/2010/06/sommer-sonne-strand-und-vorfreude.html">quit his PCT thru-hike</a> :/ <br /><br /><a href="http://flattr.com/thing/985/Hiking-in-Finland-Ultralight-Backpacking-Blog" target="_blank"><img src="http://api.flattr.com/button/button-compact-static-100x17.png" title="Flattr this" border="0" /></a></div>

It was an interesting week. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Nordic-Lightpacking/128701720487438">Nordic Lightpacking got its own Facebook Fansite</a>, and if you become a Fan it is an easy way stay on top of developments at NOL, as well as easy access to all our new articles. With that out of the way, enjoy this weeks picks for &#8221; The Week in Review&#8221; - and check back tomorrow for another cottage manufacturer interview which you surely will like!<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/gG33CnV5zeAR3VEXTe20NzWiupv70N-RGKSfyQFBX78?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TBzRB10lViI/AAAAAAAACz8/6sS6tkLb6-s/s800/IMG_0565.JPG" /></a><br /><br />The light, rock formations and colours in the Grand Canyon are awe-inspiring, and Down The Trail takes us on a climbing trip up <a href="http://www.downthetrail.com/grand-canyon/climbing-cardenas-butte/">Cardenas Butte</a>.<br /><br />Cedar & Sand shares with us his trip to the Zion National Park and lets us take part in the &#8221;<a href="http://cedarandsand.blogspot.com/2010/06/other-zion-narrows-exciting-times-in.html">Exciting Times in Parunuweap Canyon</a>&#8221;. Awesome red rock formations, cougar tracks, cows and toads make for a great read. Superb photography, as well.<br /><br /><a href="http://ulsterwalker.blogspot.com/2010/06/mourne-way-marathon-2010.html">Keith Brownrigg did the Mourne Way Marathon</a> this year, and in the 4:36:11 he run it in he even found time to snap some photos. His account is interesting, maybe this is something for the people hiking on the Fastlane!<br /><br />Mark&#8217;s trip report to the <a href="http://backpackingnorth.blogspot.com/2010/06/porcupine-mountains-michigan-trip.html">Porcupine Mountains in Michigan</a> has some sweet b/w photographs, and colour where colour is need. Great report of what looks like another superb destination for a trip.<br /><br />Mungo & Matt went on a day <a href="http://www.mungosaysbah.com/2010/06/mungo-matts-hike-in-valley.html">Hike in the Valley</a>, which is a very excellently written post with humor and great photos. And you can also learn a thing or two, so go have a read!<br /><br />Kilimanjaro is a splendid destination, and <a href="http://roamthehills.blogspot.com/2010/06/kilimanjaro-shira-route-day-1-start-to.html">The Weekend Dude from Roam The Hills</a>, went to climb it in 2008. His account of this journey is now slowly finding its way online, and worthy of your time.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/AI5waPheTtbTFNtC6cLAC58W-vh5cI34sFNJ1D2LziY?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/Spvr-AjaQBI/AAAAAAAAAOc/VwWA0qlMRDY/s800/IMG_0573.JPG" /></a><br /><br />Cameron McNeish and Chris Townsend got together to make a <a href="http://www.cameronmcneish.co.uk/2010/06/chris-gear-for-the-pacific-north-west-trail/">great video</a> of the gear which Chris will be taking on his Pacific North-West Trail hike this summer, go have a look if you plan a long-distance hike!<br /><br />Another <a href="http://lightweightoutdoors.com/?p=1072">unpacking video</a> this week was done by Phil, who showed off his TGOC gear.
