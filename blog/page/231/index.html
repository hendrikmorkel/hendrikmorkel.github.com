Day 1 summary: Weather nice, conditions shit.<br />Day 2 summary: Weather shit, conditions worse.<br />Day 3 summary: I&#8217;m so glad I am on my way home.<br /><br />Not all backpacking trips are awesome, some suck. This trip was of the latter kind. Be prepared for some foul language, therefore this post is rated R 18. It is also a very long story with plenty of photos, so better take a cup of coffee/ tea and enjoy.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/GXDYblcxPQLBeD18eFtz9A?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S7nZ72VHIGI/AAAAAAAACEs/lw_2bwGaW8w/s800/P1030741.jpg" /></a><br />A lone star appearing at dusk of day one.<br /><br />It started out nice, the 3 hour ride to <a href="http://outdoors.fi/page.asp?Section=5313">Salamajärvi NP</a> went well, we arrived at one o&#8217;clock and despite the weather forecast&#8217;s promised rain we had a blue sky and sunshine. Xavier packed his ULA Conduit and soon after we set along the short stretch of road towards the trail head. Some fishermen were ice fishing, a good indicator that the ice still carries, despite a layer of water on top.  The Plan™ was to walk the 59 km Hirvaan kierros circle trail, but as so often with The Plan™, it didn&#8217;t work out.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/VObmz2uHTYTMqqjTWcVnzA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S7nsRfGrFxI/AAAAAAAACGU/qybTB1MQSDA/s800/P1030580.jpg" /></a><br />Xavier in a good mood at the trail head.<br /><br />The trail was unbroken. We tried for a minute without snowshoes, but sinking in till over the knee doesn&#8217;t make for good walking so the snowshoes came on. This improved the sinking in marginally, now we sunk in only till the knee, but every step was more difficult as the water soaked snow was heavy on the snowshoe surface, adding quite some weight to every step. Five minutes later I was ready to turn around, which I would have done if I wasn&#8217;t with company. Easter 2009 I spent alone hiking in <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2009/04/helvetinjarvi-easter-hiking-trip.html">Helvetinjärvi NP</a> and that trip of potholing was still fresh in my memory, I didn&#8217;t need to add a further one to it. Xavier said this would be normal snowshoe conditions for him, and that he was up for a challenge. A challenge for me would be <a href="http://i-cjw.com/blog/2010/03/05/thief-in-the-fortress/">climbing a mountain in Japan with Chris</a> and not potholing through a forest.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/ImZoHlIATjgHpfdNNjaIwA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S7nsWUVA8CI/AAAAAAAACGY/zYsQSHn963Y/s800/P1030585.jpg" /></a><br />The moss was happy about the amount of wetness, from above and beneath.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/218bKboy7lWAf7eDs0snjQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S7nsW9fmS2I/AAAAAAAACGc/x4GTMoRB54g/s800/P1030593.jpg" /></a><br />Finnish spring in the forest.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/hSNy5UHC7ZqUVYnRn0w6JA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S7nsYVZLjxI/AAAAAAAACGg/dJ-OjKzTbeE/s800/P1030594.jpg" /></a><br />Signs of previous forest fires.<br /><br />We continued, missed the first turn we should have taken and hence walked an additional five kilometers in these splendid conditions. The Plan™ of walking the complete 59 km circle was already buried, and so we decided to make the best of it. Because of the missed turn we went to Pahkahongankangas and further up to Pyydyskoski, where much to my pleasure someone with snowshoes had broken the trail for some part. Then 3,1 km through unbroken snow towards Heinkinjärvi, and while the sun was shining I was seriously frustrated. As we arrived at the lake, I spotted some tracks in the snow, and while we weren&#8217;t sure then I now know that they were from a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverine">Wolverine</a> - there are only around 150 of these in Finland, so quite a rare sight! With the lean-to in sight, my mood improved, and after a short break at the shelter I set off to explore the surroundings, while Xavier started the fire. <br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/qZEhCY3Y4hUZhbYNltzRkQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S7nsZveNKNI/AAAAAAAACGk/pr11jkqkmC0/s800/P1030599.jpg" /></a><br />Xavier enjoying the broken trail.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FwevkyG2MK9JWCFd72ThEQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S7nsbDpfNXI/AAAAAAAACGo/5CciBPPUr3o/s800/P1030608.jpg" /></a><br />Ants are getting ready for the summer.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/fgO3EgL5qzWASSxGYsf7oA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S7nsgIJMafI/AAAAAAAACGs/khvRG0m_CW4/s800/P1030616.jpg" /></a><br />Close to the lean-to shelter at Heikinjärvi, I can almost smile.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/DL36XrWPT2tGO9WckNdUPg?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S7nshbK0AQI/AAAAAAAACGw/C3zmcpd0LJU/s800/P1030619.jpg" /></a><br />Wolverine tracks!<br /><br />After my short trip I started to pitch the <a href="http://www.gossamergear.com/cgi-bin/gossamergear/Spinn-Twinn.html">Gossamer Gear SpinnTwinn</a>, in a nice spot, which will ensure the sun shining down on me in the morning. A pair of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_cygnus">Whooper Swans</a> was flying over the lake, their call echoing through the woods. With the very tasty <a href="http://www.trekneat.com/en/trekn-eat-products/products/katadynshopconnect/trekn-eat-gerichte-ohne-fleisch/tne-bio-chili-p252ree-mit-gem252se-hanfcrispies1p/">Trek&#8217;n Eat Vegetable Puree with chili and hemp seeds</a>, a kuksa of redwine, the warming glow of the fire and the pretty sunset, this was about the best moment on the trip. After a <a href="http://www.trekneat.com/en/trekn-eat-products/products/katadynshopconnect/trekn-eat-dessert/tne-mousse-au-chocolat-1-p/">Trek&#8217;n Eat Mousse au Chocolate</a> and a cup of tea I retired to my sleeping bag, falling asleep quickly. <br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/yjoObXYcoaEH10P6IEBSsQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S7nsjY0zZlI/AAAAAAAACG0/_Q70uZgApVU/s800/P1030632.jpg" /></a><br />Signage.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/0uQczZ6nXIBAEYBAaY9d2A?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S7nslVh42rI/AAAAAAAACG4/-BL8YVQrlhQ/s800/P1030657.jpg" /></a><br />SpinnTwinn from the side.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/BlIsmSdYD0LXqtfzrc0FMA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S7nsl3oW1-I/AAAAAAAACG8/giXtHpQtT3E/s800/P1030670.jpg" /></a><br />Home is ready, the woodshed in the background.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/RRhOEOM1PHXGP8rzEx5b6Q?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S7nsns9KFzI/AAAAAAAACHA/952QYC5PREM/s800/P1030682.jpg" /></a><br />Lifting my spirits, tasty food and red wine.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/v-hgxtCDrbse68_aPc7DCA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S7nsoDnkKCI/AAAAAAAACHE/k68DAqUyFHQ/s800/P1030696.jpg" /></a><br />Sunset.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/81TlrwRraNC9ZTYQHM0NnQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S7nsoSmthaI/AAAAAAAACHI/OOBIVif1cmg/s800/P1030729.jpg" /></a><br />Boiling water for my evening tea.<br /><br />The sunrise into the tarp never came. Instead, low hanging mist and rain which was falling on the spinnaker fabric of the tarp. The rain intensified the need to pee, and instead of getting into the hardshell clothes, have a pee and then getting out of them and back into the sleeping bag I decided to pack everything up and retire to the lean-to for breakfast. This was done in relative peace, I like rain but knew that this rain will make snowshoeing today utter misery. After the morning pee was taken care of, I decided to try to start the fire only with my puukko and firesteel, and after a while I had the piece of birch bark burning, and I was mighty proud of myself! The fire was burning well, and my coffee and breakfast water soon was hot.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/8BkTZ8dCXuppAkO39ArffA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S7nss9sFW1I/AAAAAAAACHM/op9uIXno9jo/s800/P1030749.jpg" /></a><br />Good morning! View from the sleeping bag.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/pV9NH3ymRKQ4n4DkluOOMQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S7nstTcSs0I/AAAAAAAACHQ/1dkEbdgL6rk/s800/P1030752.jpg" /></a><br />The fire which was made only with knife & firesteel.<br /><br />As Xavier still didn&#8217;t appear, I gave him a little visit, and still sleepy he said he shall rise soon. By the time he came I was fed and packed up, ready for snowshoeing in the rain. An hour later we hit the trail, and yes, it were the wretched conditions I thought they would be. The high exertion with the drizzling rain and general moistness brought the eVent membrane in the <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2009/11/gear-talk-rab-momentum-jacket-drillium.html">Rab Momentum jacket</a> to its limits, and it felt like I was as wet on the inside as I was on the outside. We walked to Heikinjärvenneva, where a bird watching tower rises over the swamp, giving a great view but there was not much to see except mist, rain, snow.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/KVs3ehf3Eg2hoYdNCS8Fbw?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S7nsvWQ0vGI/AAAAAAAACHU/c20Kf1YufKY/s800/P1030756.jpg" /></a><br />The Eye of Sauron.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/dWjzEFKfWYzd_TAiGrXwnw?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S7nswF_rRnI/AAAAAAAACHY/igTCRoaeJiM/s800/P1030771.jpg" /></a><br />View from Heikinjärvenneva tower.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/KeLKiGaKNoYdXKBZ11L0ZA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S7nswgm4qWI/AAAAAAAACHg/3yoqT2Veac8/s800/P1030778.jpg" /></a><br />Markings in bark.<br /><br />We continued towards Kaulus, an old smoke sauna building, and had a short rest in the cabin. A lonely skier peeked inside, said that he was on the way to Sysilampi cabin and will leave us a nice trail, and went off again. Motivated by the promise of a warm cabin, with an opportunity to dry the gear and ourselves, we continued and I managed to find a good gait and rhythm so I led for most of the time to Sysilampi. Arriving at the cabin, the lone skier was just eating his meal and chatting with his friend as we came in. Friendly talking about backpacking and trips ensued, and the misery was temporarily forgotten.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/YvBmbKFr7bW0bJwi7_UjMw?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S7nsyxREmMI/AAAAAAAACHk/y56BbngjVcA/s800/P1030786.jpg" /></a><br />Sysilampi cottage. Previously this was a day trip hut, but now has mattresses and it is allowed to sleep in it.<br /><br />The guys left, and soon after a group of three girls arrived. The cabin was big enough to house us five, but I decided to try and pitch the tarp, which thanks to the saturated ground was futile and so I told the girls that I&#8217;d retire to the room next to the woodshed while they could enjoy the cabin with the oven. The evening was spent drinking some more red wine and talking about this and that, and as the girls went off to the sauna I retired to my sleeping bag. <br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/lVnrQLsO6zdGJeszp98KpA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S7ns0ABojUI/AAAAAAAACHo/qHR3xHOtZ94/s800/P1030796.jpg" /></a><br />Boiling water on the morning of day three.<br /><br />Last evening Xavier and I had decided to walk this morning to the parking lot 600 m down the trail, and follow the road back to the car at Koirasalmi. I was not willing to put myself through another 10,2 km of snowshoeing when I could just walk 12 km on a forest road at triple the speed and a kazillion times more comfort. After a breakfast of <a href="http://travellunch.de/frameset_eng.htm">Travellunch müsli with orange juice</a> and a cup of coffee, kindly provided by <a href="http://www.petesy.co.uk/">Mr. Macfarlane</a>, we started walking. A mere two and half hours later we were back at the parking lot, I was happy to have put this behind me. In the car, on the way back to the main road I spotted a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrao_urogallus">Western Capercaillie</a> but by the time I had the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002MUAEX4?ie=UTF8&tag=hikiinfinl-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B002MUAEX4">Lumix GF1</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=hikiinfinl-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B002MUAEX4" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />out he had taken off to the top of a tree, and only aimed with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IKLJVE?ie=UTF8&tag=hikiinfinl-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B002IKLJVE">20mm Pancake Lens</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=hikiinfinl-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B002IKLJVE" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />I wasn&#8217;t able to get a decent photo of him. Ah well, their mating season is just starting so hopefully I will be able to see some and get a photo or two of them.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/-HmmVVO9fjJDWBsw9BnC9g?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S7ns1hKA7kI/AAAAAAAACHs/Xau0Jekr2iM/s800/P1030803.jpg" /></a><br />The road to Koirasalmi.<br /><br />My frustration with the snowshoeing this weekend is simple: The snow didn&#8217;t carry at all, and I broke in 95% of the time. Then the wet snow sat on top of the snowshoes, weighting them down and making walking a pain in the ass. What was very nerve wracking was that I never knew if the next step will carry or not, it did make a completely unpleasant experience. I asked the guys as the cabin how they fared in these conditions with the skis, and they said that on the swamp the skiing was OK while in the forest it was just as much of a pain as with snowshoes. So even with skis the whole trip would only have been around 30% better. While I am not normally someone who gives up easily, I knew I wouldn&#8217;t enjoy myself plenty under this conditions and hence my readiness to turn around. I didn&#8217;t turn around and while I had some good moments, I believe it would have been a better trip if either we would have had decent minus temperatures so that the snow carries, or there wouldn&#8217;t have been any snow.<br /><br />The national park was pretty, or at least what I saw of it - most of my concentration went towards placing the next step, so only once in a while I could take in the scenery. I plan to be back when the snow is gone, maybe in May or June, or then in autumn, that circle trail is still in my mind and I&#8217;d love to walk it. But for the moment, I will sit inside and wait till the snow is gone, as I don&#8217;t need another rather not so nice experience - I go backpacking to enjoy myself, and potholing with snowshoes in the rain certainly doesn&#8217;t count as enjoyment for me.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/NhQxll8S0D3abPf9GLdB6A?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S7ns2x-hoRI/AAAAAAAACHw/JxJIjAf6MRs/s800/P1030812.jpg" /></a><br />The garbage of the three days.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
A few watchful readers have seen already that I was sporting a <a href="http://www.montane.co.uk/">Montane</a> Fireball Smock <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/03/video-optimus-crux-lite-in-winter.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/03/first-look-laufbursche-huckepack.html">there</a>, and have requested further information. I shall not disappoint, and here&#8217;s a first look at this fine insulation garment.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/rOFm1oLBZhnf7BQPLculFg?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S7L3zxl_fUI/AAAAAAAACC8/2_m6gBZLnmM/s800/Montane%20Fireball%20Smock-2.jpg" /></a><br /><br />It is 262 g in Size M, which will be of interest to the weight conscious hiker and trailrunner. Filled with Primaloft Eco and covered in Pertex Quantum, it is warm, soft to the skin and keeps wind, snow and water out. I used it in <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/03/siikaneva-trip-report.html">Siikaneva</a> and <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/03/repovesi-trip-report.html">Repovesi</a> as well as on trail runs, and it does not fail to fulfill my expectations. It is roomy enough to wear it over my shell layer, and it is so warm that I didn&#8217;t need to wear the down pullover I brought on those trips. On my next trips I will leave the down at home and just take the Fireball, it&#8217;s that warm.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/K6syY_x5T_j4X0NoCCuFKQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S7L3ydSe8tI/AAAAAAAACC4/7ZMdW38ApRc/s800/Montane%20Fireball%20Smock-4.jpg" /></a><br />A look on the double zipper and the soft chin covers in the collar.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/mAhMPbcRjl9-VxNyU6eRuA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S7L3wjvVUwI/AAAAAAAACC0/gtNlw07A50E/s800/Montane%20Fireball%20Smock.jpg" /></a><br />Filled with Primaloft Eco (50% recycled fibers) makes me a happy and warm man.<br /><br />It has no pockets, which is fine for me. The reflective details are great for the dark months of winter when you wear it in the city, ensuring your safety. It has a stuff sack and can be compressed to the size of an orange, thus won&#8217;t take much space in your pack - though I usually have it on the outside for quick access. The double zipper allows you to vent with the top closed around the neck, and venting you&#8217;ll need if you decide to wear it while hiking, it is pretty damn hot. Available in the autumn from a dealer near you, or from the <a href="http://www.ultralightoutdoorgear.co.uk/montane.html">Ultralight Outdoor Gear Montane Pro Store</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FQo_Zzti3tubBP-21t4ZPg?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S7L31ikKqSI/AAAAAAAACDA/wyInxlHp7SQ/s800/Montane%20Fireball%20Smock-3.jpg" /></a><br />Venting.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
I&#8217;m very honored to present you another great interview this Monday. After Donald Kevilus from <a href="http://www.fourdog.com/">Four Dog Stove</a> saw my <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2009/12/video-bushcooker-lt-ii-in-winter.html">first video</a> of the Bushcooker LT 2 he range me up and gave me some valuable tips, resulting in my <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/02/video-bushcooker-lt-ii-in-snow-take-2.html">second try</a> which was much better. We have chatted a couple of times now, and I have learned a lot in our conversations and emails. Don is a very knowledgeable man if it comes to outdoor and bushcraft skills, and thus I am very proud to present you this interview! <br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/rtbNOL40CqfuinztfOAK7A?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S7DCrqmspqI/AAAAAAAACBA/Btl8v-Nj-Cg/s800/scan0004.jpg" /></a><br />Don with his work mules &#8220;Bill&#8221; and &#8220;Big Jake&#8221;.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Don, please briefly introduce yourself and tell us who you are. Since when are you backpacking, and how did you start? How often are you out backpacking nowadays?</span><br /><br />I&#8217;m a true Minnesota boy, born and raised. I was given the chance to spend a great deal of my childhood roaming and playing in the forest and fields. My people on both sides of my family where farmers and woodsman. So I learned my love of the land and a reference for nature from them. They were people of the land and had all come from hard scrabble, so from them I learned strong bush skills and how to make your own gear and that you never buy what you can do for yourself.<br /><br />My father was my greatest mentor, he taught me a love and respect for nature and how to do the most with the least. To him going to the woods was his place of worship. He never took more then he needed and always left more then he took. His idea of camping was a coffee can to cook in, a wool blanket and a piece of canvas using a old burlap feed sack for a backpack. He would always challenge himself how to do more with less. We would place ourself in the lap of mother nature and relish in it&#8217;s glory.<br /><br />He also taught me from a young age to be a true tinker, making things and modifying items to make them more useful for our needs. I don&#8217;t think he ever bought anything that he didn&#8217;t modify.<br /><br />I now I live in central Minnesota with the love of my life, my wife Roxanne, life partner of 25 years. We have 40 aces woods and pasture where we grow a large garden, have chickens, guinea fowl and saddle and work mules that I use for my farming and logging. We are not a cottage industry, where a back shed industry where the wife works with me to hand craft the stoves we use and sell. We a very lucky that we are able to live where we work and play.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/038MLeSnZXbz2W_otfyQ8g?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S7DCsnr4imI/AAAAAAAACBI/iW-HvY7WnXo/s800/IMG_0039.JPG" /></a><br />Roxanne Kevilus working on ti &#8220;Bushcooker Lt&#8217;s&#8221; with titanium tent stoves to the right in the shop.<br /> <br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Are you a lightweight/ UL backpacker? If so, what is your typical baseweight?</span><br /><br />I would say I&#8217;m more a lightweight/ bushcraft backpacker. I also like to go by mule, kayak or pull a pulk when I warm camp in winter. But by far my favorite method of travel in nature is with the bare minuim carried on my back. The more you know the less you carry. Weight is an issue but durability is also important. Having worked mules most my life and living hard I have found that items fail when they&#8217;re under stress. In my life that gets you damaged or makes for an unpleasant experience at best. I would rather carry a axe in winter and a strong durable &#8220;puukko&#8221; knife anytime I go to the bush knowing I can meet my needs for warmth and shelter. Also, if I buy or make it I only have to do it once. Technology never makes up for skill. My base weight would be 7 lbs 9 oz.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Four Dog Stove sells a lot of different gear, from the big Four Dog Stove over Titanium Portable Stoves to the Bushcooker Lt, as well as some Bush Gear. Can you tell us a little bit about the beginnings of Four Dog Stove, the birth of the Bushcooker Lt, and how it developed over time?</span><br /><br />I wanted the wife to go out with me in the winter months and with temps that go down to -35°F she wanted heat. So having made larger stoves to heat the house and shop before I made one for a tent. I wanted something durable that a person could sleep with loved ones and feel safe. That was the start of Four Dog Stove Company 22 years ago. Over the years from feedback from outfitters, trappers, hunters, guides and wilderness travelers there was a need for a stove that was light and durable that some where using for up to 3 months in the winter months at temputures down to -45 degrees for weeks on end.<br /><br />So in 1999 I started working making trails stoves out of titanium with great success because it gave the user a stove that was lighter, durable and that would last a life time and not fail. As you learned at -30 when failing is not an option. They have been in use now for eleven years with no failure to date.<br /> <br />From my experience as a youth, making hobo stoves with my dad from cans (who did ride the rails in the 1930&#8217;s) and being a student of refugee stoves in Africa I started to play with different designs using titanium. I started selling some in 2002 but became discouraged because of the the poor fire skills of most people. Up to that point most of my customer base had good basic outdoor skills so I had not experienced that before. From that point on I just sold to people that had good skills.<br /> <br />Then last June I developed the &#8220;Bushcooker LT titanium&#8221; that allowed the user to use alcohol, esbit and any bio-mass with the same stove at a weight never before seen. The beauty of the Bushcooker Lt is, it allows the user to use the fuels at the same time. So it makes a little bit of alcohol or Esbit in to a lot by using wood or charcoal. No other stove at this time offers the simplicity, durability, flexibility that the Bushcooker Lt offers. Use the alcohol and Esbit as training wheels, till the user learns good fire skills.<br /><br />All my stoves are made in my shop, nothing is out sourced. They are made with help from my helper Jeff Bruske, my wife Roxanne and myself. We are not brokers, we use what we make and sell what we make.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/ENpUIqUoS-GkT7iI9l1j0A?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S7DCtQxIrlI/AAAAAAAACBM/p1xEvwQhOiU/s800/IMG_0040.JPG" /></a><br />Roxanne and Jeff Bruski working in the shop. Combined Jeff and Don have over 75 years outdoor experience and 50 years metal working skills.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Don, we love to be let in on the work-in-progress stuff! Can you let us know a tiny bit on what kind of new products you&#8217;re working at the moment?</span><br /><br />I&#8217;m working on different pot and windscreen/ heat exchangers for the Bushcookers for long-range wilderness travel. The stoves are burning as efficient as possible now. What we have to work at is transferring that energy to what is being heated or cooked. Also I&#8217;m starting to do more instruction and hands-on workshops. I&#8217;m into the fifth year of doing my &#8220;TINCAN BUSHCOOKER&#8221; workshop where the students hand craft there own gasifiction wood stove from paint cans using basic hand tools. At the end they all burn and learn how to use the stove bringing a litre of water to a roiling boil in 8-10 minutes with 3 1/2 oz of twigs. I will be posting directions on my web sight in the near future for people to do it themselves.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/IzDL_53wP_3LLgOfRA-k0g?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S7DCvRigisI/AAAAAAAACBg/pq_jJu8YGIQ/s800/008.JPG" /></a><br />Bushcooker LT I + Bushcooker LT II with windscreen heat exchangers and Evernew 0,75 l and 1,0 l pasta pots.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">How works the R&D at Four Dog Stove, do you have a need yourself that you try to fix, or do some of your clients inspire you for new products or ask you for solutions to their problems?</span><br /><br />I have always listened to my clients and their needs. I feel very lucky to have been able to learn from them and provide them solutions for their cooking and heating needs in some of the coldest places on earth.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">What is the most sold piece of gear from Four Dog Stove? Also, where do your customer come from?</span><br /> <br />The flagship of Four Dog Stove would be my Four Dog Model steel stove. They are primarily sold to the USA western hunting market where 25% of the hunters are still packing in with horses and mules.    <br /> <br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">What is your own favorite backpack, sleep system and shelter?</span><br /><br />My favorite pack would be  Gossamer Gear Mariposa, sleep system would be Exped hammock + Feathered Friends Winter Wren<br />(plus a Exped 7 Downmat in winter), as well as a Hilleberg Bivanorak.<br /> <br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">From our telephone calls I know that you know Mors Kochanski, and meet him every once in a while. I consider you very skilled and informed when it comes to bush craft, can you tell me and my readers a few of these skills which you think would be most essential to know when going out?</span><br /><br />After my father Mors would be my Guru. I know of no other person more knowledgeable of the Boreal forest, my home, than Mors. His knowledge and ability to teach others no matter their age or skill level about the wilderness is amazing. I feel honored and humbled to know and have sponsored courses done by Mors and to say he is my friend.<br /><br />I would say after 50 years of sleeping in the bush the most important skills to have would be clothing, fire and knife skills; and going to gain the knowledge necessary to be become truly at ease in the arms of mother nature, no matter what the season or the weather.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">When and where was your last longer backpacking trip, and what was your baseweight? Are you planning to get out for a trip soon, and enjoy the winter season in Minnesota?</span><br /> <br />I&#8217;m very lucky that where I live that I can go out of my door and be in nature. I normally try to sleep out at least 2-3 nights per month. Sometimes it&#8217;s only 1/2 mile from the house, other times I will travel to one of the many wilderness areas we have here in Minnesota for 2-3 days. Because of my livestock and business it limits the length of time I can be away. I always warm camp<br />3-4 days when it gets the coldest in Jan or Feb to test gear and concepts. If it works at 30 below it works anytime.<br /> <br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/RlejtmdEVUQAit_ePeu_rQ?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S7DCuKJEVxI/AAAAAAAACBU/74iYZcxscG8/s800/IMG_0048.JPG" /></a><br />Titanium tent stoves being pre-burned for shipment to the Netherlands to be used in Swedish made Tentipi tents.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Do you think ultralight backpacking will become more popular and break into the mass market, or will it continue to be something for a small group of people? </span><br /><br />I think most outdoor camping is on the decline because people have found easier ways to entertain themselves, with things which take less effort and skill. It takes time and willingness to learn how to enjoy the outdoors on its terms and not to endure. I do think there will always be a core group with a passion that will follow their heart. But main stream no. They will buy the clothes and maybe some gear but never take the time to develop their skills which they will need to truly enjoy the woods.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Don, I thank you for taking the time to answer my questions. Is there something you would like to add?</span><br /> <br />I once again I would like thank you for the chance to share with you and others a little bit about myself and Four Dog Stove Co. I hope that I&#8217;m able with what I make and the knowledge I can share, I will help people to get out into nature and be able to enjoy it with family and friends. If in a small way I help that happen I have done something right. So thank you and may you always find a warm meal and a dry bed.</div>
