I hate November in Finland. It is by far the most miserable and grey month, and I decided that this will be the last November I will have spent in Finland. Next year I will swap this grey misery of fog and no sunshine to a month at the beach or mountains or rainforest or all of the aforementioned, somewhere in the south where the sun shines and the sky is blue. There shall be possibilities for hiking, climbing and biking as well, besides lounging at the beach. After some time googling for ecological holiday homes and only finding rubbish a friend recommended me <a href="http://www.airbnb.com/tell-a-friend?airef=w3kpza02eczz5"target="_blank">Airbnb</a>. I had a look at the site, checked available accommodations at our preferred destinations, and it definitely looks like the way to go. So if you&#8217;re equally fed up with grey, foggy, depressive, snowless Novembers in you neck of the world, check out  <a href="http://www.airbnb.com/tell-a-friend?airef=w3kpza02eczz5"target="_blank">Airbnb</a>. <br /><br /><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/16442800?color=ffffff" width="440" height="248" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen allowFullScreen></iframe><br /><br />Darren lives in Australia. Australia is totally a country where I could picture myself living. Their Novembers are not grey & depressive. Not at all, as Darren shows on his <a href="http://djm74.blogspot.com/2011/11/packrafting-shoalhaven-river.html"target="_blank">packrafting the shoalhaven river</a> trip.<br /><br />John is walking the GR7 at the moment, and it took him to <a href="http://e4longdistancewalk.blogspot.com/2011/11/stage-3-gr7-through-murcia.html"target="_blank">Murcia</a> last week. The sun shines also in Spain.<br /><br />Nick <a href="http://www.invertedworld.co.uk/blog/2011/11/welcoming-back-greenwich-mean-time-on-scolty-hill/"target="_blank">welcomes back Greenwich Mean Time on Scolty Hill</a>.<br /><br />The 2012 Ultralight Backpackers Summit will be held in Slovenia, as decided by the majority of people who voted - Awesome =) Now <a href="http://ultralightsummit.com/2011/10/31/the-polls-are-closed/"target="_blank">lets find a date which suits most of us</a>. Please go and <a href="http://www.doodle.com/smbrqiz62xa88cpv"target="_blank">choose your preferred date in the Doodle calendar</a> before the hobbits, dwarfs and elves behind this continue planning!<br /><br />David&#8217;s mate took some <a href="http://www.selfpowered.net/2011/11/smorgasboard-of-gentle-adventuring.html"target="_blank">fine photo on the HRP</a>.<br /><br />Dave discusses <a href="http://ultralighter.blogspot.com/2011/11/backpacking-in-or-out.html"target="_blank">In Or Out</a>?<br /><br />Jack shows us a <a href="http://velohobo.com/2011/11/05/free-ultralight-wood-burning-stove/"target="_blank">free, UL wood stove</a>.<br /><br />Alan had <a href="http://alanrayneroutdoors.blogspot.com/2011/10/sad-sensible-and-greendale-tarn-oh-and.html"target="_blank">a wet walk on Greendale Tarn</a>.

Snow like Ryan had it on his <a href="http://guthook.blogspot.com/2011/10/snowy-stratton-102911.html"target="_blank">Snowy Stratton daytrip</a>.<br /><br />James shares <a href="http://glencoemountaineer.blogspot.com/2011/11/some-thoughts-on-soloing-posted-by.html"target="_blank">some thoughts on soloing</a>.<br /><br />Kinpu continues to post superb MYOG articles. His latest article shows how he made a <a href="http://lamarcheasuivre.blogspot.com/2011/11/sac-dos-concept-prototype-en-tyvec.html"target="_blank">backpack prototype out of tyvek</a> - which has the advantage of being easy to work with and cheap.

Or possibly she should have read Mike&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ukhillwalking.com/articles/page.php?id=2923"target="_blank">Successful Long Distance Path Walking</a> article beforehand.<br /><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Lk0IGB6p-rtPUJbDTHKV9ZaRYsR4KT_8jKEdg9tkUtU?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-uEH-zOeLEHg/TiwYmYvTucI/AAAAAAAAFBg/LdrT7qgw3wM/s800/P1030334.jpg" height="600" width="800" /></a><br /><br />Ken is currently in Turkey. Turkey is the beautiful country between the Mediterranean and Black Sea. It also has beautiful Novembers. Ken&#8217;s account of his hikes around the country are well worth your time, and his <a href="http://awanderingknight.blogspot.com/2011/10/turkey-day-4-ephesus.html"target="_blank">Ephesus</a> account will delight the history and archeology fans among you.<br /><br />If you like grey and soggy weather, I reckon you will love Scotland. James seems to like <a href="http://backpackingbongos.wordpress.com/2011/11/05/bothy-vagabonds-in-the-far-north-pt1-ben-armine/"target="_blank">Scotland, and Bothys</a>. I wonder if he was disappointed by the sun and blue sky, which occasionally seemed to come through.<br /><br />If you like racing, backpacking, and a combination of both, check out the inaugural <a href="http://bedrockandparadox.wordpress.com/bob-marshall-wilderness-open/"target="_blank">Bob Marshall Wilderness Open</a> which Dave is putting together.<br /><br />A <a href="http://lacemine29.blogspot.com/2011/11/whistler-2011.html"target="_blank">MTB park video</a>.

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
I have been lusting for a GoPro camera since well over a year. I know <a href="http://contour.com/"target="_blank">there are</a> <a href="http://www.vio-pov.com/"target="_blank">others</a> out nowadays, but the GoPro is the original for me - it was the first one around, is used by all the cool kids up in Alaska on their packraft and bikepacking trips, but yet I always held out - the sound of the original GoPro was not up to scratch, and 300$ is a lot of money. <br /><br /><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/GUEZCxBcM78?hd=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />Well, that all changed just with the introduction of the GoPro HD HERO2 this week. Called the &#8220;Professional&#8221; HD camera it is double as awesome as the original <a href="http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-5513079-10726106" target="_blank" onmouseover="window.status='http://gopro.com';return true;" onmouseout="window.status=' ';return true;">GoPro HD Cameras</a><img src="http://www.lduhtrp.net/image-5513079-10726106" width="1" height="1" border="0"/>and one of the things which makes is really cool in my opinion is its in-build setting for time lapse. Yeps, that&#8217;s right - time lapse, that malevolently difficult way of photographing stuff and making it look awesome afterwards. It also adds a microphone jack, so I can attach my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005D9VILS/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=hikiinfinl-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=B005D9VILS">Rode Videomic Pro.</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=hikiinfinl-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B005D9VILS&camp=217145&creative=399373" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />Exquisite, if I may say so. If you haven&#8217;t yet, now would be a good time to click play on that video up there to see what the HERO2 is capable of. I will wait here, so go ahead, click play.<br /><br />The new HD HERO2 Outdoor Edition comes with a waterproof housing to 60 meters, so I can take it diving, a whole assortment of straps to attach it to my helmet - nice for [ice] climbing, cycling and packrafting (also eliminates the fear of accidentally dropping an absurdly expensive photo camera into the water!) and a variety of other mounts as well as a pivot arm. Damn, all that&#8217;s missing is a dolly! It shoots 1080p at 30 FPS, has a f/2.8 Fixed Focus with a variety of Fields of View Options: From super-wide 170º Wide FOV over 127º Medium FOV to the narrow 90º FOV, there&#8217;s something for every situation. In addition it got an easy User Interface and red LEDs on all sides which let you know the camera is running. And instead of me repeating the Specs & Features, you could just head over to the GoPro site and read them yourself. If you rather hear it from me - its a fine piece of gadgetry HD video camera widgetery which opens up very creative possibilities for us backpacking, bikepacking, packrafting, skiing and climbing folks.<br /><br />At the same time as the HERO2 was announced, GoPro also told us about the Wi-Fi BacPac + Wi-Fi Remote which will come out in February 2012. What&#8217;s cool about the former is that it will enable long range video remote control via the Wi-Fi Remote or, much cooler,  a smartphone GoPro App. That is pretty forward thinking stuff right there - use your phone to control the camera, and see what the camera sees. You even could live stream if you&#8217;re inclined to do so. Its almost Star Trek kind-of-awesomeness.<br /><br />So, in case you haven&#8217;t guessed yet: I made a purchase decision for a GoPro HD HERO2, Outdoor Edition. I can&#8217;t wait till the camera arrives, allowing me to filming mundane things like walking with the pram in the park and cycling through the city to more adventurous stuff like singletrack mountain biking, packrafting and climbing. I&#8217;m also really looking forward to shoot time lapses with it, and use it as a Behind-The-Scenes camera for ULAZ. <br /><br />Go get yours at the <a href="http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-5513079-10701008" target="_blank" onmouseover="window.status='http://gopro.com';return true;" onmouseout="window.status=' ';return true;">Official GoPro® Store</a><img src="http://www.tqlkg.com/image-5513079-10701008" width="1" height="1" border="0"/> - the HERO2 comes in three outfits (you want the Outdoor one!) for 300$ while the original HD HERO retails now for 200$ to 240$. Give it yourself to christmas if you need a reason, or tell your significant other that I made you buy it.<br /><br /><i>Disclaimer: There&#8217;s terrible affiliate links hidden in this post.
