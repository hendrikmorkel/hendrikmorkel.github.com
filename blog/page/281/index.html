<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"><a href="http://www.gossamergear.com/">Gossamer Gear</a> was the first name I came across when looking for UL gear. The Mariposa backpack was totted as an awesome pack by many of the German and UK UL blogs I am reading, and the shelters, trekking poles and pads rounded out a very nice selection of UL gear. I got in touch with the two men who are behind the company, Founder Glen Van Peski and President Grant Sible, who&#8217;s running the company today. This week Glen answers my questions, and next week Grant will tell his story and in which direction Gossamer Gear will develop.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/XhN1iWDUNlVOTjQ7krGCgg?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/Su3mFw0ledI/AAAAAAAAAxg/u4R96jy6H5Q/s800/CIMG0650.jpg" /></a><br />Glen on his trip in the Sierra, a couple of weeks ago.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Glen, since when are you backpacking, and how did you start? How often are you out backpacking nowadays?</span><br /><br />I started backpacking as a Boy Scout, in Massachusetts. Our troop had a series of campsites in the local woods that we went to periodically.  Each patrol had it&#8217;s own campsite, improved with a fire pit, latrine, and all sorts of lashed furniture. Definitely not &#8220;Leave No Trace&#8221;. When my sons joined Boy Scouts, in San Diego, we joined a troop that did real backpacking, culminating every year with a week-long trip to the Sierra. These days, my backpacking is somewhat limited. I have a demanding job as a civil engineer, as well as remaining involved in Gossamer Gear, but I still manage to typically get in 20 days of backpacking a year.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">When and why did you start to go lightweight/ UL?</span><br /><br />When my oldest son joined our local scout troop, my friend Read Miller was the Scoutmaster. He read Ray Jardine&#8217;s original book, The Pacific Crest Trail Hiker&#8217;s Handbook, and started reducing his own pack weight. He got me to read the book also, and I started lightening my load about the same time. We challenged each other to move lighter and lighter, continually weighing gear.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Gossamer Gear is one of the most outstanding UL cottage manufacturers, mainly due to the very popular backpacks, like the Mariposa and Gorilla. Can you tell a bit more about how you started the company, and how it developed over time?</span><br /><br />When I had to &#8216;gear up&#8217; for our Scout troop&#8217;s Sierra trek, I went to the local REI and explained I was going to the Sierra. They loaded me up with all the old standbys: An internal frame pack that weighed 7 lbs empty, a huge sleeping bag, a MSR stove with a set of aluminum pots and pans, sierra cups, insulated mugs, plates, steel utensils, rain gear, tons of clothes, big boots&#8230; a huge load of stuff. Upon reading Jardine&#8217;s book, I figured out fairly quickly that a pack weighing seven pounds empty represented a great opportunity to lighten up. I made my first pack, dubbed the &#8220;G1&#8221; based very loosely on the Alpine Rucksack that Jardine mentions. I ended up using this pack for the next several years, even though it was big and ugly. My second attempt, the &#8220;G2&#8221; was made entirely out of 1.1 oz. silicon-coated nylon. My son Brian had the misfortune to use this pack on a John Muir Trail trip where it shredded. It was later reconditioned and traveled the California sections of the Pacific Crest Trail. Read and I started going on hikes outside of Boy Scouts. As we hiked along, we kept thinking up ways to improve the packs and make them lighter. This led to the, &#8220;G3&#8221; and finally the &#8220;G4&#8221;. I provided instructions for making the G4 pack on a website. Periodically I would get emails asking if I would sew a pack for someone else, to which I would answer no. These were the very early days of ultralight backpacking, and the emails kept coming; and I finally started to feel bad about telling people &#8220;no&#8221;. So I invested the time in generating a real pattern and detailed instructions, and lined up some people to sew. In the beginning the packs made locally, real locally, by my wife Francie, and other women in the neighborhood. The packs were custom orders, with the customer choosing fabric color and options. As the waiting list got longer, I decided I needed to see about getting the packs made commercially. I found a manufacturer in Seattle, and went through the iterative process of obtaining a suitable quality product. The manufacturer, who had previously made packs for major manufacturers, initially was nonplussed about making the packs. After a series of exchanges back and forth, with me explaining why they were still not right, the manufacturer summed it up with &#8220;These are not like other packs we&#8217;ve made&#8230;&#8221; That hurdle crossed, production started in earnest.<br /><br />The manufacturer told me that normally his minimum order was 100. I figured that if I had 25 packs made, everyone who wanted one would have one, and I could get back to my family and my engineering business. We compromised on an initial order of 50 - I figured I would have the packs in my garage for a few years, but that eventually I could get rid of them. Initially, the packs were available in one size, and four colors. It quickly became apparent that I had underestimated demand. Word spread quickly on the internet, and G4 production became an ongoing reality. My son Brian put together a website to take orders. Several years later, to accommodate new products, the website was completely revamped by my sister Brooke.<br /><br />In early 2004, the decision was made to ramp up GVP Gear, in an effort to generate a critical mass that would allow me to get back some of my life. By that time, the business was consuming a large part of my time, without contributing financially to my family. Rather than raise prices, we decided to increase the number of products offered to generate some synergy, and create enough volume to allow automated systems to be put into place. So the move to Gossamer Gear was launched.<br /><br />With the new products, including shelters, sleeping bags, stoves, raingear and many other innovative products, volume did soar. The order fulfillment portion of the business was outsourced, which freed up my time. Shipping was eventually brought back &#8220;in-house&#8221; when my wife Francie was looking for something to do now that the kids were older. Eventually, however, as more and more ultralight enthusiasts discovered Gossamer Gear&#8217;s innovative products and low prices, my time managing the business kept expanding. Eventually I was working 60 hours a week on engineering and another 30 on Gossamer Gear (still without salary). I was making a good living with the engineering, so the money wasn&#8217;t an issue, there just weren&#8217;t enough hours in the day for living.<br /><br />When I could not longer handle it, I was prepared to have a big sale and close down Gossamer Gear.  When I happened to share this with a longtime customer and dedicated hiker, he convinced me to bring in some equity partners who would hire staff and take the time burden off me. So in December 2005, the Gossamer Gear offices moved to Austin, Texas, where the new President, Grant Sible, hired staff and took over the day-to-day operations. I am still Chairman of the Board, and actively involved in product development, policy and vision, and of course product testing!  There are more statistics and a timeline on our website, under &#8221;<a href="http://www.gossamergear.com/cgi-bin/gossamergear/about.html">About Us</a>&#8221;.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/crUpGzwuCALXwsjHVgm3yA?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/Su3mEubYuUI/AAAAAAAAAxc/DYJjoFReo90/s800/CIMG0417.jpg" /></a><br />On the WTS course in the Wind Rivers.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Gossamer Gear aims to be innovative, ultralight and affordable. Are you yourself developing still a lot of gear, or did Grant take over this responsibility?</span><br /><br />We actually both work on this. From his day-to-day running of the business, Grant has a much better idea of what customers are looking for.  I am more interested in what I want to make. For instance, our most popular pack, and the only to be recognized as &#8220;highly recommended&#8221; by Backpacking Light, the Gorilla, was designed by Grant (Gorilla is his trail name). I work on items that are of interest to me, some of which never make it to production because there&#8217;s not enough of a market for them.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">What is the most popular piece of equipment from Gossamer Gear?</span><br /><br />Hard to say. We are generally best known for our packs, and those generally are our best sellers. The G4, having been around for over 10 years, has a substantial following, including a Yahoo group devoted to people making their own G4 packs. The Gorilla will probably end up being our best seller after a year or two, as it provides a way for transitional hikers to lighten their loads.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">What kind of new innovations can we expect in the next years from Gossamer Gear? More &#8220;soft goods&#8221; like the complete pack raincover or also new &#8220;hard goods&#8221; like shelters and backpacks?</span><br /><br />We have a number of products we are pursuing. Unfortunately, with limited resources, we can&#8217;t pursue everything we&#8217;re interested in. We have a new one-person, double-wall shelter we&#8217;re looking at, and several pack ideas. We want to do another 2-person shelter, and some lighter variations on our existing shelters.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">What is your own favorite backpack, and did you make it yourself?</span><br /><br />For many years, our pack line traced my personal journey in lightening my load: I started with the G4, then moved down to the G5 (no longer manufactured), and am currently using the Murmur. I used a prototype Murmur that I sewed myself for many years, but am now using a stock Murmur. It works great for me for trips 6 days or less without a bear canister. Since my total loads are typically below 15 lbs, I do not use the waist belt.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">You were hiking this with Backpackinglight.com&#8217;s Wilderness Trekking II course. How did you like the course, and will you be on similar outings in the future?</span> <br /><br />This year I had a great opportunity to help Andrew Skurka lead the Wilderness Trekking II course for BPL&#8217;s Wilderness Trekking School (WTS). They have a great team at WTS headed up by Mike Clelland!. It was great to spend time with Andrew again, and I learned as much as the students I&#8217;m sure! We were in the Wind River Range in Wyoming, which is beautiful countryside. I also participate in local courses through Wilderness Outings (WO), but the WO trips are in local mountains that I have traveled a number of times. Anyone who can get in on a WTS advanced course should do it. I doubt I will have time to participate in 2010, as I have been asked to do a lecture series and hike in Japan, and I have other planned trips as well.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Do you think ultralight backpacking will become more popular and break into the mass market, or will it continue to be something for a small group of people?</span> <br /><br />Ultralight backpacking HAS trickled down into the mass market, witnessed by the offerings of mainstream manufacturers. A lot of the innovation is still being driven by the cottage manufacturers, but you&#8217;re seeing lighter and lighter offerings by the major manufacturers.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Are you  the cooperating &#8220;behind the scenes&#8221; with other cottage manufacturers? Are you for example in touch with Henry Shires from Tarptent, Brian Frankle of ULA or any of the other cottage manufacturers, and talking about developments and the like?</span><br /><br />A few of us cottage manufacturers get together once a year for our &#8216;brain trust&#8217; hike (although in 2009, due to injuries, it ended up just being Henry and I). It&#8217;s a great time to get together, trash talk each other&#8217;s gear, and dream. We don&#8217;t really formally collaborate on designs, although you can certainly see some common elements in some of our offerings. But we do talk about where things are going generally.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Glen, I thank you for taking the time to answer my questions. Is there something you would like to add?</span><br /><br />My passion is getting out into the backcountry with light loads that maximize my time out there and my enjoyment of the time in the backcountry; and making gear available to help other people do the same. But the important thing is not the gear, it&#8217;s getting out there!<br /><br /><a href="http://technorati.com/faves?sub=addfavbtn&amp;add=http://www.hikinginfinland.blogspot.com"><img src="http://static.technorati.com/pix/fave/tech-fav-1.png" alt="Add to Technorati Favorites" /></a></span></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">I was on a 24 trip this weekend with a French UL backpacker, trip report coming this week. I&#8217;m really busy at the moment with a project in Helsinki, doing long hours, which is why replies to comments weren&#8217;t immediately forth coming, and also reading what my fellow backpack-blogger mates were up to took a backseat as after 10+ h working I was too tired to read what went on. I try to catch up this coming week, and leave you with a early winter impression from my trip.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Y69z9Q0ATE_qdf7eKl3o2Q?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/Su284mWnLQI/AAAAAAAAAwk/CDVxSvncH60/s800/IMG_3165.JPG" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://technorati.com/faves?sub=addfavbtn&amp;add=http://www.hikinginfinland.blogspot.com"><img src="http://static.technorati.com/pix/fave/tech-fav-1.png" alt="Add to Technorati Favorites" /></a></span></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">The week started with an <a href="http://hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/2009/10/interview-henry-shires-from-tarptent.html">interview of US cottage manufacturer Henry Shires from Tarptent</a>, so what better way to close the week to interview one of Germany&#8217;s foremost UL backpackers, Carsten Jost - better know to many by his Trailname of &#8220;Sauerkraut&#8221;. Carsten writes his own blog <a href="http://fastpacking.de/wordpress/">Fastpacking</a> (in German), and he (nearly) thru-hiked this year the <a href="http://www.luontoon.fi/page.asp?Section=8300">Nordkalottleden</a>. So without any more of my drivel, here&#8217;s the interview!<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/_Ou0MxTipPew8bygF3flqw?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/SunTOhZEz9I/AAAAAAAAAwA/XQJLb5ELKKg/s800/Carsten_03.jpg" /></a><br />Goat Rocks Wilderness on the Pacific Crest Trail.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Carsten, could you tell a bit about yourself for those who don&#8217;t know you or your blog? Where are you from, when did you start backpacking?</span><br /><br />I&#8217;m from Germany and happen to live in the Allgäu region close to the Alpes which is a blessing if you are interested in outdoor sports in any form. I was pretty fortunate that I started backpacking pretty early when I joined the boy scouts at the age of 7. Scouts really use old traditional gear that really sucks even if you compare it to the new traditional stuff that is available in outdoor stores nowadays. The good thing is that if you use gear that is not really good you always have to have a Plan B. You have to be a problem solver and being able to adjust to situations. Not by using the coolest newest gear but with common sense and proper techniques.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">When and why did you adopt your UL philosophy, of packing light and going fast?</span><br /><br />Appalachian Trail here I come! On my first long-distance hike in 2004 I found out that I didn´t know everything there is to know about trekking even though I had thought that before I started the trail. Most hikers were definitely not as experienced as I was but still managed to stay alive with a lot less weight on their shoulders and flimsy looking gear. I basically had all the weird prejudices against UL gear that you can have. But after having hiked a couple of hundred kilometers and seeing that UL-gear worked for everybody around me it made me thinking wether I was just a stupid ignorant German, which I probably was :-) And honestly, once you felt the benefits of hiking UL, there is no turning back. It just makes sense.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">You hiked both the Appalachian Trail and the Pacific Crest Trail. You announced a while ago that you&#8217;re aiming for the Triple Crown and want to walk the Continental Divide Trail as well. When do you think it is so far, and how are you preparing yourself for it?</span><br /><br />The triple crown is not something you do because you want to have the triple crown. It&#8217;s something you can&#8217;t hide from if you did the other two already. It&#8217;s a force that pulls you and from my perspective there is something wrong with you if you can withdraw yourself from the call of the trail. You have to do it sooner or later. I had the plan to hike the CDT in 2011 but life is changing ever and always and so I don&#8217;t have a definite date right now. But the trail is calling and one day I WILL hike the CDT.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Qc7eOBdagVMeC0JFWjj2mg?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/SunTO2gUhoI/AAAAAAAAAwE/P_NWFYOBEns/s800/Carsten_02.JPG" /></a><br />On he Nordkalottleden.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">This year in September you did a thru-hike of the Nordkalottleden, starting in Norway and walking through Finland till you finished 800 km later in Sweden. Could you tell a bit about that experience? Was it your first time hiking in Lapland?</span><br /><br />Technically I didn&#8217;t thruhike the Nordkalottleden but &#8220;just&#8221; hiked from Kautokeino to Kvikkjokk. On the last stage I changed the route due to really bad weather. Instead of hiking the last 170km on the Nordkalottleden I hiked 140km on the Patjalantaleden. I had 15-20cm of snow and it kept snowing with gusty winds. As the Nordkalottleden is rougher than the other established trails in Lappland and higher in elevation than the Patjalantaleden I opted for the safer route. It was my first time in Lappland but I want to go back :-)<br /><br /><object width="480" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/WzSaSW4gxok&hl=en&fs=1&color1=0x234900&color2=0x4e9e00"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/WzSaSW4gxok&hl=en&fs=1&color1=0x234900&color2=0x4e9e00" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object><br />A short Video from the Beginning of the Nordkalottleden, and an unwanted pursuer!<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">You&#8217;re one of the leading UL backpackers in the German scene. What kind of advice would you give to someone who thinks about going UL?</span><br /><br />That sounds funny :-) I&#8217;m definitely one of the few fortunate German hikers that have the gut to take time off to realize their dreams. The hardest part of long-distance-hiking and probably going UL as well is just overcoming your fears and facing the unknown. Being open to new ideas and trying things to find out if it works for you is key.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Where do you think UL backpacking will go in the future? Will it become mainstream or will it always be something that only a select few will practice?</span><br /><br />I don&#8217;t think that UL will become mainstream. I went UL out of necessity and got hooked by the positive effects. It is much harder to go light if necessity is not a driving force. I totally think that most hikers would be better off with light gear but it is up to everybody himself to develop his or her own gear philosophy. What I wanted to say with this is simple &#8220;Hike your own hike&#8221;.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Finally, lets talk some gear. What are your favourite pieces of gear at the moment?</span><br /><br />As Lappland just kicked my butt big time and my gear helped me to work through the harsh conditions I come up with three products I really like:<br /><br />GG Mariposa Plus : Even though I will retire this pack after being on trails with it for 5000km it´s been my pack of choice.<br />Thermarest Neo Air short: Comfy and light.<br />Mammut Borah DLX: It was not the perfect shoe for the conditions I was in, but the shoe is definitely worth looking at if the terrain is a little more rugged than the normal long-distance-hike.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/w0m79Zpsq1ZkSA3tvLRZBw?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/SunTPtgq92I/AAAAAAAAAwI/1oNVHFkOmhY/s800/Carsten_01.jpg" /></a><br />Appalachian Trail.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Carsten, I thank you for your time. Do you have any wise words for the end?</span><br /><br />Overcome your fears. Hiking long-distance-trails and experiencing the freedom and flexibility that UL-gear will offer is so rewarding. I went UL for the last approximately 10.000km and I´m not going to change. That alone should make you start thinking wether you should give UL a try.<br /><br /><a href="http://technorati.com/faves?sub=addfavbtn&amp;add=http://www.hikinginfinland.blogspot.com"><img src="http://static.technorati.com/pix/fave/tech-fav-1.png" alt="Add to Technorati Favorites" /></a></span></div>
