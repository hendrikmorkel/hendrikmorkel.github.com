Plenty of old and trusted gear, mixed with some new gear, and also some mandatory and traditional pieces of gear, here&#8217;s the packlist of my trip to Russia and my evaluation of it. Get ready for some Geartalk!<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Xasr7QAWRxgmaXw9G-QPiQaHJjYRDRV4S5g4VqcfkwU?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TLsns7L-1QI/AAAAAAAADbQ/nIGRk5A523E/s800/Screen%20shot%202010-10-17%20at%207.41.14%20PM.jpg" height="800" width="593" /></a><br />As in previous discussions <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/03/ul-weight-watchers.html" target="_blank">in the article here</a>, I use Skin-out as the boundary. That puts me 365 g over the Lightweight limit, OMG!<br /><br />Backpack: A bigger version of the <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/03/first-look-laufbursche-huckepack.html" target="_blank">LAUFBURSCHE huckePACK</a>, made from Dyneema X Grid. 49 l with up to 10 liters more, it was big enough to carry all my gear and ten days of food - comfortably! I had by far the smallest and most compact backpack, something I find, if walking off-trail in forests an enormous benefit - it means less whiplashes for the people behind me and less get tangled up in trees and shrubbery.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/0VP18YXML5GCFzJyUoLqywaHJjYRDRV4S5g4VqcfkwU?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TLAYmYnVFXI/AAAAAAAADVM/pqTmECWap54/s800/IWG_Russia_0538.JPG" height="632" width="800" /></a><br /><br />Shelter: The <a href="http://www.hyperlitemountaingear.com/products/echo-i-tarp.html" target="_blank">Hyperlite Mountain Gear Echo I Tarp</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.hyperlitemountaingear.com/products/shelters/echo-i-beak.html" target="_blank">Beak</a> were my home at night in Russia. Light and roomy and giving plenty of protection for me and my gear, it was a great shelter which will see more use in the coming months. Theoretically I wouldn&#8217;t have needed the shelter at all, as it didn&#8217;t rain - but then I already brought it, and just using a bivy might have been too &#8220;extreme&#8221; in terms of me using other gear than the rest of the group and standing out even more wasn&#8217;t necessary. Detailed review forthcoming.<br /><br />Sleeping: A MLD Alpine bivy with a Dyneema X Grid bottom and eVent 2L top, purchased from a BPL member, was the extra protection against wind and rain (well, moistness from underneath as it didn&#8217;t rain). The decision for the MLD Alpine was made after reading how happy <a href="http://armchair-adventurer.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Dave</a> was with his, as well as expecting more rain. The Exped Groundmat was a present from <a href="http://nature-base.de/" target="_blank">Jonas</a> and I am glad I took it. The ground was moist and mossy at most campsites, so having a mat on which to lay out gear was welcome.<br /><br />That I love quilts should be well known to the regular reader by now, and my GoLite Ultra 20 performed well yet again and kept me nice and warm. The <a href="http://www.artiach.de/content/cms/front_content.php?client=1&amp;lang=1&amp;idcat=54&amp;idart=170&amp;m=&amp;s" target="_blank">Artiach Skin Micro-Lite</a> was a new try on how comfy and warm self inflating pads can be, and I wasn&#8217;t disappointed. A more detailed review will come in the future.<br /><br />Kitchen: I carried the Bushcooker LT III as common gear for my food partner and me, but as we were able to make a fire each day it wasn&#8217;t needed. The <a href="http://www.trekking-lite-store.com/trekkingshop/Outdoor-Kueche/Snow-Peak-Titanium-Trek-1400::87.html" target="_blank">SnowPeak 1400</a> was perfect and will be my go-to pot for the coming months, offering plenty of space to melt snow and also to make bannock and pancakes. The <a href="http://www.alpkit.com/shop/cart.php?target=product&amp;product_id=16374&amp;category_id=283" target="_blank">Alpkit Lhoon</a> is affordable and perfect for my type of cooking, and service from Alpkit is outstanding. A new drinking vessel is my <a href="http://www.kupilka.fi/en/products/kupilka+21/" target="_blank">Kupilka 21</a> kuksa, lighter than my wooden one and a bit bigger - just right for a cup of coffee or tea. A more detailed review on Kupilka crockery and cutlery is coming, so stay tuned.<br /><br />Clothing - Worn: <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/02/gear-talk-woolpower-merino-awesomeness.html" target="_blank">Woolpower</a> for underneath. <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2009/11/gear-talk-rab-momentum-jacket-drillium.html" target="_blank">Rab Drillium pants</a> as usual - I expected rain, remember? - though I switched to a <a href="http://www.outdoorwarehouse.co.uk/index.cfm?action=shop.detail&amp;b=Rab&amp;p=Demand%20Pull%2Don%20Smock&amp;pid=A71990D3-FF29-08BD-48DE70E715FAD4F5&amp;cid=F0590123-93E6-4369-8E1EF4936A670469&amp;bid=47AE73A3-FF29-08BD-48FD8CE9D046462E&amp;order=priceHigh&amp;parent=&amp;page=1" target="_blank">Rab Demand Pull-On</a> this time around. Splendid smock, it breaths fantastic, is light and the one pocket is much more to my liking than two. Detailed Review forthcoming.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.finisterreuk.com/technicalsurfapparel/mens/zephyr-boxer-shorts-10/11-p159-c43.html" target="_blank">Finisterre Zephyr Merino Boxer Shorts</a> for that next-to-skin comfyness, warm, non-smelly, looks good. Wouldn&#8217;t take anything else anymore when I go backpacking, be it one night or two weeks.<br /><br /><a href="http://inov-8.com/Products-Detail.asp?PG=PG1&amp;L=26&amp;P=5050973135" target="_blank">Inov-8 OROC 280</a> on my feet, perfect grip on any surface and so much lighter and more comfortable than the rubber boots the rest was wearing. Detailed review forthcoming.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/rxY-afnwLkPOeMuXlszuSwaHJjYRDRV4S5g4VqcfkwU?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TLAVtsL-auI/AAAAAAAADTI/ui3hC_WVTxw/s800/IWG_Russia_0836.JPG" height="600" width="800" /></a><br />SnowPeak 1400, Inov-8 OROC 280, Woolpower 200 socks.<br /><br />MLD gaiters = great, Suunto Core = detailed review in the future, but I can say that I liked it a lot (first watch I&#8217;m wearing in twenty years!) and also the GG LT4s were excellent. Only one member of the group used trekking poles, and while I myself am only a recent convert I found them very beneficial. On super swamp day they allowed me to probe the ground, on summit day they made the climb up and down simpler, and in the evening they were used to pitch my tarp. I think they&#8217;re a good investment for people with joint and back problems, as they seem (so others tell me) to take some of the stress of them. More on them in detail as well.<br /><br />Clothing - Carried: <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2009/10/first-look-klattermusen-loke.html" target="_blank">Klättermusen Loke</a> is awesome, detailed review coming after using it for over a year. The <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/03/gear-talk-integral-designs-plq-jacket.html" target="_blank">PLQ pants and pullover</a> from Integral Designs were with me in case it would have got cold and also as wet weather insulation. I wore the PLQ pullover every day, the pants twice. If I would have known that it wouldn&#8217;t rain I would not have taken either, as the Loke could have taken the duty. Extra socks were  a recommendation, though taking both the 600 and 800 was overkill and the 600 would have been enough.<br /><br />The MLD eVent rain mitts I yet have to wear when it rains. It seems they&#8217;re my good weather charm, and if I need to carry 36 g for it to stay dry then that ain&#8217;t too bad, me thinks. The Cyclone Buff is excellent and was worn during the summit day, where it was so windy that if I would have jumped up in the air I likely would have flown a couple of meters with the wind! Trekmates GoreTex socks for camp, as usual.<br /><br />Photography: I carried a new test camera on this trip, sans spare battery - so all photos from this trip - nearly thousand - were taken with the Panasonic Lumix G2. I&#8217;ll not lose much words on the camera now as I&#8217;ll write a more detailed review on it in the future; though the photos already can give you an idea of it.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/4pAoBwLp2hp8TJvOwHCodgaHJjYRDRV4S5g4VqcfkwU?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TLAdQJwavwI/AAAAAAAADZI/lBWDP9joz5M/s800/IWG_Russia_0052.JPG" height="600" width="800" /></a><br />So, where should I go?<br /><br />Various: Puukko as my trusted knife & also a mandatory item. Recta DT 220 compass, used twice: On the day I was guiding and on the last night, because it is easy to get lost in the dark if you camp on top of a ridge! Gränsfors Bruks Small Forest Axe as mandatory group gear, a very nice axe which I used quite a few times. Sharp, well balanced and practical if you need to split wood for a fire or cut down a dead tree to make a pole for your tarp. Detailed Review forthcoming. <br /><br />Suunto Comet, my small compass & thermometer, always handy but with the Recta compass and my Suunto Core maybe not necessary anymore. Baby powder was a last minute buy for footcare, in order to keep feet in good health after walking through swamps. As I used only 11 g in nine days the whole package was unnecessarily big, need to refill it for future trips in appropriate portions. The iPhone was dead weight, and I also had not enough time to read so both book and phone could have stayed in the car. <a href="http://www.princetontec.com/index.php?q=remix"target="_blank">Princeton Tec Remix</a> headlamp was just perfect for this time of the year, the red light is so much more comfortable on the eyes when walking in the dark as it doesn&#8217;t kill the natural night vision of the human eye (white light does). <br /><br />Personal First Aid kit wasn&#8217;t needed, also not the fixing stuff. Hygiene, I could have taken less soap (should have taken a Mini Dropper bottle!), everything else was ok. Maybe I should have cut my toothbrush shorter to safe some extra weight?<br /><br />Conclusion: All gear worked excellent, though some was too much - I think I could have taken a few pieces less and still have been as comfortable as I was now. In comparison with the other students I think I was just as well-equipped and comfortable (if not better, oh my!), but given that I carried less weight on my back in a more compact pack I believe I had a better experience. Less weight means less stress on joints and back, it is easier to navigate in difficult terrain, one can carry less food and overall can enjoy the walking part more as ypu don&#8217;t need to just watch your steps. Not being able to have a blazing fire in front of my cuben tarp was the only shortcoming of my UL gear, though I can life with that. So that was the Russia gear extravaganza.

The food plan was one of the tasks which the planning group needed to carry out. We got a suggestion of meals, complete with calorie values et al. and it was aimed at a budget of about 6€/ day. I followed it only in part (we had two mandatory meals for the rest days, Borscht soup and Chili), but for the most part I sticked what I knew worked for me. The calorie recommendation was 3500 kcal/ day, which is far too much for me (I&#8217;m 175 cm tall, about 64 kg light) - especially given that we only walked between four and eight kilometers a day. Here&#8217;s the food I took on the trip:<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/dxq9M0LW70N3U8pBfGvXxTWiupv70N-RGKSfyQFBX78?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TLLftX2828I/AAAAAAAADag/dN28ypt0rIA/s800/Screen%20shot%202010-10-11%20at%2012.55.06%20PM.jpg" height="800" width="685" /></a><br />Ten days menu.<br /><br />The food was more than enough, I actually had at the end 1731 g over (that includes the spare day of 604 g) and on the trail was dealing out snacks to classmates. Let me tell you what was good and what wasn&#8217;t:<br /><br />Breakfast; own Müsli vs TravelLunch Müsli. My own mixed Müsli wins, hands down. Not only in respect to taste, but also in calories. The TravelLunch Energy Müsli is terrible, I threw away most of it as I couldn&#8217;t get it down. The Choco müsli was better, but still far away from my own creation. So own müsli in the future. Starbucks Via, which <a href="http://lightweightoutdoors.com/"target="_blank">Phil</a> bought for me, was my morning & lunch coffee. Very tasty stuff, super lightweight (a satchel is what, two or three grams?) and oh so convenient. Will need to order more for upcoming trips! The Bannock was good, the Travellunch egg powder wasn&#8217;t. I&#8217;ll try more Bannock in the future, especially on rest days a nice start into the day, easy and tasty.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53783299@N08/5079074818/" title="Photo Share by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4057/5079074818_2615eb5166_z.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Photo Share" /></a><br />The whole days meal packed up.<br /><br />Lunch: Ramen vs own Spaghetti: I dehydrated ready-made spaghetti sauce, one pot Arabica and one pot Gorgonzola, which was enough for six meals. I used Corn and Full grain spaghettis, broken into smaller sizes to fit in a Ziplock bag, where I added salt. Now, the Ramen noodles are fast and easy and have decent calorie values, but I much preferred my own creation, even if it took longer to prepare them. Instead of the recommended 1 l of water for 100 g of spaghetti, I only used about 300 ml and poured the whole content of a Ziploc bag in my pot and had it boil/ simmer for ten minutes, until the noodles were al dente. I then ate it as it was, without pouring away any water, which was super tasty. This was inspired by Ray Jardine, and it worked great. I think I might still use Ramen in the future, but my own spaghetti creation definitely will become a staple.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Wv6awpNlFCq_fRNFhoYIdQaHJjYRDRV4S5g4VqcfkwU?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TLAZ0idfBCI/AAAAAAAADWA/9-yh90SuIww/s800/IWG_Russia_0373.JPG" height="600" width="800" /></a><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/w95scps4Fowc79C8J0d2NwaHJjYRDRV4S5g4VqcfkwU?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TLAdC4D3vzI/AAAAAAAADY8/PBfTiqlW4lg/s800/IWG_Russia_0032.JPG" height="600" width="800" /></a><br />Blueberries and Lingonberries, a healthy and tasty addition to my diet on the trail.<br /><br />Dinners: I was waiting for an order from <a href="http://www.outdoorfoodshop.de/"target="_blank">Outdoor Foodshop</a>, but because I was late it didn&#8217;t arrive in time. So it was TravelLunch this trip, as my local outdoor shop decided to take Real Turmat out of the programme (bloody morons, those folks - taking the best meal out of the line-up, wtf?). I love the convenience of pouring boiling water in a bag, let it sit for five to ten minutes and ten munch without needing to do the dishes - that&#8217;s perfect & simple. The meals all were tasty, my favourite is definitely the Peasoup, it is less a soup and more a potato mash with veggies, but I really love it. The other meals all were fine, the Meatballs was a 2-Person portion and was a bit too much for me, but otherwise good. But definitely looking forward to trying the meals from the Outdoor Foodshop on the next trips!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53783299@N08/5079089674/" title="Photo Share by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4107/5079089674_79cbe04b9e_z.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Photo Share" /></a><br /><br />Snacks: <a href="http://oatsnack.de/"target="_blank">Energy Oatsnacks</a> rock! Super, super tasty and so much energy, these are a staple for me already. Many different tastes, from Yoghurt-Strawberry over Latte Macchiato to Cherry-Cocoa, I find them all very delicious and they have plenty of energy for their weight (67 g including packaging).<br /><br />I found a new version of Sesame snacks, which come in plain, coconut and chocolate, the latter two are excellent and I never get tired of them, these are a staple on each trip. Add in a bag of Van Houten Chocolate as a night cap, and that rounds out my Menu.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53783299@N08/5079112084/" title="Photo Share by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4067/5079112084_416ce80355_z.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Photo Share" /></a><br /><br />The mandatory meals we split up, me doing the Borscht and my food partner doing the Chili. Both were tasty, and not that much more heavy as a freeze-dried meal (I think the Borscht, which I carried, came down to about 180 g/ person and that was a massive portion). The Soya meal which I made on the first night was tasty as well, but with a preparation time of close to 45 minutes it takes far too long - something for rest days, maybe?<br /><br />Add in the berries I found - Cranberries, Blueberries and Lingonberries - and which were consumed en route, it was a good and tasty trip. I remember walking the <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2009/06/karhunkierros-i.html"target="_blank">Karhunkierros</a> back in 2008, with nothing but Supermarket Pasta meals for dinner, and they came out of my ears already on the third evening - dinner and lunch wasn&#8217;t something we looked forward to, so in my opinion a healthy and tasty menu makes the outdoor experience much more worthwhile!<br /><br />So this was my Russian diet. Fairly lightweight for an autumn expedition, I think - it could have been a bit lighter, but I ate very well and looked forward to each meal every day, which is a good sign in my opinion, thus I didn&#8217;t mind the bit of extra weight (parmesan & olive oil). In future I might try, even if I like them a lot, a trip without snacks and only with nuts & dried fruits. Figuring out what is the right amount will then be paramount, I tend towards 75g/ day at the moment for spring till autumn, and around 125 g for winter? Also, dehydrating and mixing your own meals, while a bit of extra work, saves money and is good fun. With a dehydrator at my dispossable, I definitly will make good use of it for the next couple of trips.</div>
