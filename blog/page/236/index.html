After a very relaxing holiday in the Netherlands, there&#8217;s a lot of catching up to do of what happened in the outdoor blogsphere during the week abroad. Lets start!<br /><br /><object width="853" height="505"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/FcfWsj9OnsI?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;color1=0xe1600f&amp;color2=0xfebd01"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/FcfWsj9OnsI?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;color1=0xe1600f&amp;color2=0xfebd01" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="853" height="505"></embed></object><br /><br />Lets start with the trips. Alberto De Giuli takes us on the <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&u=http://www.albertodegiuli.com/2010/08/via-ferrata-pertini-rifugio-stevia-vallunga-valgardena/"target="_blank">Via Ferrata Pertini Rifugio Stevia Vallunga Valgardena</a> and shows that one doesn&#8217;t always needs to go to the super popular places in the Dolomites. <br /><br />James was <a href="http://backpackingbongos.wordpress.com/2010/08/07/backpacking-the-southern-arenigs-from-llanuwchllyn/"target="_blank">backpacking in the southern Arenigs from Llanuwchllyn</a> for a weekend, and had two nice wildcamps and brought home some fine photos.<br /><br />Dondo takes us on the <a href="http://dondo1.wordpress.com/2010/08/06/james-peak-wilderness-loop/"target="_blank">James Peak Wilderness Loop</a>, a beautiful trip report with beautiful photos. <br /><br />Comet now left California and is on the trail in <a href="http://www.iamthechan.com/2010/08/09/oregon/"target="_blank">Oregon</a>, getting closer and closer to the Canadian bother on his PCT hike. <br /><br />Some fine, fine photos is what Fraser lets us see from his holidays at <a href="http://mcalisterium.wordpress.com/2010/08/06/the-outer-hebrides-harris-and-lewis/"target="_blank">The Outer Hebrides: Harris and Lewis</a>. If you&#8217;re as yet undecided where to go, this would be a tempting destination.<br /><br />I also liked Matthias&#8217; photos from his <a href="http://uloutdoors.wordpress.com/2010/08/06/gossamer-gear-murmur-probetragen-am-schneeberg/"target="_blank">walk on the Schneeberg, where he took his GG Murmur</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://thunderinthenight.blogspot.com/2010/08/under-weather-ultralight-adventure-in.html"target="_blank">Joe&#8217;s Ultralight adventure in the Hardangervidda</a> also has stunning photos and shows that UL gear also is at home in the mountains. <br /><br />Paul from Sharkey&#8217;s Dream went for a walk over the <a href="http://www.sharkeysdream.walkingplaces.co.uk/?p=3684"target="_blank">Clough Head & The Dodd’s</a> and I enjoyed this very scenic walk a lot. It is nice to see a walk documented from start to finish so well, so I recommend you stop by and give it a look!<br /><br />James from The Lighter Side was <a href="http://fynyddafr.wordpress.com/2010/08/06/playing-in-the-beacons/"target="_blank">playing in the Beacons</a>. <br /><br />Project Hyakumeizan from One Hundred Mountains reckoned that the best thing to do in the Japanese rainy season is to <a href="http://onehundredmountains.blogspot.com/2010/08/waders-of-lost-arc.html"target="_blank">climb through rivers</a> as you&#8217;ll get wet either way. It is a great adventure which you should have read!<br /><br />The absolute highlight this week came from Roman Dial. A real gem, Roman shares with us <a href="http://packrafting.blogspot.com/2010/08/2006-arctic-1000-625-miles-in-24-days.html"target="_Blank">The Arctic 1000 adventure</a>, including the <a href="http://packrafting.blogspot.com/2010/08/2006-arctic-1000-lists.html"target="_blank">gear lists</a> and <a href="http://packrafting.blogspot.com/2010/08/arctic-1000-photos-by-request.html"target="_blank">photos</a>! It is an epic adventure, and I hope you take the time to read and see them!<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/sNFuDXfUKajVeFDUCG31SHuaAsOEDbUjS8lvO9CZbwA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TFZRnS5tZFI/AAAAAAAAC84/YQ0BqA1FKnQ/s800/P1020757.JPG" /></a><br /><br />I like my Ti-Tri/ Caldera Cone. How cool would it be to bake Pizza on it? That&#8217;s what <a href="http://backpackingtechnology.com/backpacking-trips/pizza-on-a-caldera-stove-outback-oven/"target="_blank">Bob from Backpacking Technology</a> thought as well, and set out to try it on a recent trip - with much success! Go and check it out to add a new culinary experience to your trips!<br /><br />Benjamin looks at <a href="http://hrxxlight.com/?p=632"target="_blank">all the other stuff from the OutDoor 2010</a>, and in case you haven&#8217;t seen it yet it is worth a look.<br /><br />Roman is back from his Via Alpina trip, and <a href="http://lighthiker.wordpress.com/2010/08/09/via-alpina-2010-gear-wrap-up/"target="_blank">reviews his gear</a> for said two week journey across the Alps.<br /><br />Adelaide from Dressed in Dirt ponders about the <a href="http://www.dressedindirt.com/2010/08/reconsidering-because-of-ray-jardine-sleeping-bags/"target="_blank">benefits of a quilt</a>, and if you&#8217;re new to the idea or still need some more convincing, check her thoughts on the topic.<br /><br />Richard takes a second look at the <a href="http://maceachain.blogspot.com/2010/08/gosystem-flt-ti-take-2.html"target="_blank">GoSystem Fly (ti)</a> and made two videos to demonstrate them in action - go and watch them!<br /><br />Maz reviews the <a href="http://www.journeymantraveller.com/2010/08/montane-prism-20-jacket-review.html"target="_blank">Montane Prism 2.0 Jacket</a>, so before you pull the trigger on it give this article a go.<br /><br />Sam shows his <a href="http://ultralightbackpacking.blogspot.com/2010/08/alcohol-stoves.html"target="_blank">alcohol stove</a> collection and recommends to loan UL gear to friends in order to convert them - a statement which I second!<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/hRXLhC4CSTdIET6uCIuD43uaAsOEDbUjS8lvO9CZbwA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TFhLRGU4KQI/AAAAAAAAC_U/f_dSITdLpJg/s800/P1020564.JPG" /></a><br /><br />What is a compass, and how do you use it? That is what <a href="http://www.briangreen.net/2010/08/using-compass-basics.html"target="_blank">this post from Brian</a> is about, and if you want to brush up your knowledge on compass and map skills, that is a good start.<br /><br />Another very good post comes from Norseman at Midwest Bushcraft and is on <a href="http://midwestbushcraft.blogspot.com/2010/08/weather-predictions-through-nature.html"target="_blank">Weather Predictions through Nature Observation</a>, for those days when there&#8217;s no 3G reception to check the weather app.<br /><br />If you hike with your dog, you might want to tune in to the <a href="http://compasspointsmedia.com/backcountry-radio-august-12-2010/"target="_blank">Backcountry Radio</a> which talks about just that, as well as some other backpacking stuff.<br /><br />Hiking Trip Reports ponders about the <a href="http://www.hikingtripreports.com/2010/08/11/summer-hiking/"target="_blank">pros & cons of summer hiking</a>. I personally am not the biggest fan of it - it is too HOT! Happily autumn and winter are soon upon us!<br /><br />Torjus lives primitively in Norway, and I find it very inspiring. Saturday he went for a short walk in the mountains and did some <a href="http://livingprimitively.com/2010/08/chase-netting/"target="_blank">chase netting</a>, getting two fine trouts as well as cloudberries and chantarelles. Love it.<br /><br />Finally, I wrote an article about <a href="http://www.helsinkitimes.fi/htimes/lifestyle-and-entertainment/12015-i-caught-a-fish-this-big-.html"target="_blank">angling and fishing in Finland</a> for the Helsinki Times newspaper, and you can also read it online. <br /><br />Remember, you now can <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Nordic-Lightpacking/128701720487438">become a Fan of Hiking in Finland and Nordic Lightpacking on Facebook</a>!</div>

While I enjoy good food and beer, seeing my family and relatives in Amsterdam, a lot happens in the outdoor scene. Here&#8217;s a look at especially noteworthy stuff - and in case you find something that&#8217;esequally excellent, leave a comment with a link!<br /><br /><object width="640" height="505"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/1Rx-hYjBpMg&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?rel=0&amp;color1=0xe1600f&amp;color2=0xfebd01"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/1Rx-hYjBpMg&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?rel=0&amp;color1=0xe1600f&amp;color2=0xfebd01" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="505"></embed></object><br /><br />Some great trips were made last weekend. Some spectacular photos can been seen on <a href="http://www.mungosaysbah.com/2010/08/photos-from-matts-algonquin-trip-july.html"target="_blank">Mungo Says Bah&#8217;s Algonquin Provincial Park solo canoe trip</a>.

The Japanese ulgear blog shows some great photos of the <a href="http://ulgstore.exblog.jp/13698234/"target="_blank">Alpacka Raft Denali Llama</a>.<br /><br />Keith, who currently walks the PCT, made a <a href="http://keithfoskett.blogspot.com/2010/08/pacific-crest-trail-pct-part-10-quick.html"target="_blank">great video on the gear</a> he carries on his trip, and for all future PCT walkers this is recommended to see!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.highballblog.com/2010/07/gopro-hd-camera-review.html"target="_blank">Constantin reviews the GoPro HD camera</a>, a camera which I&#8217;d be very curious to try out - it should be perfect for filming my packraft adventures while paddling!<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/-9yw4AcQLHMxL50exvgYWHuaAsOEDbUjS8lvO9CZbwA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TFZTbhFOiNI/AAAAAAAAC-s/LJ8f-3-byTE/s800/P1020650.JPG" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://fjallravenbloggen.com/"target="_blank">Fjällräven started a blog</a> and while it is quite empty still, I hope that it will be filled with interesting articles from &#8220;behind the scenes&#8221; soon. <br /><br />In case you sometimes wonder <a href="http://northernpies.blogspot.com/2010/08/what-forest-harvesters-do.html"target="_blank">what Forest Harvesters do</a>, then check out Mike&#8217;s report to answer that question. <br /><br />Dave, The Ultralighter, gives us a <a href="http://ultralighter.blogspot.com/search?updated-max=2010-07-30T04%3A34%3A00-07%3A00&max-results=1"Target="_blank">definition on fuel</a> so if you&#8217;re new to backpacking and wonder what&#8217;s all the talk about fuel, check this out.<br /><br />Chris from Distance Backpacker gives us a report on <a href="http://distancebackpacker.blogspot.com/2010/07/trail-mainenance-report-from-pct-i.html"target="_blank">trail maintenance on the PCT</a>.<br /><br />terrybnd is working on a new video, and shares this <a href="http://terrybnd.blogspot.com/2010/08/rough-cut-new-video.html"target="_blank">rough edit</a> of his latest project with us - go check it out, it already now looks amazing!</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Last weekend I finally managed to get away on my first trip since Vålådalen, and it included a couple of firsts: I slept the first time this year not under a tarp but in a <a href="http://lightheartgear.com/solo.html"target="_blank">Lightheart Gear Solo tent</a>, I used a <a href="http://ula-equipment.com/epic.asp"target="_blank">ULA Epic backpack</a>, and I paddled a part of the trip with my <a href="https://www.alpackaraft.com/store/index%2Ecfm?ProductID=66&do=detail"target="_blank">Alpaca raft</a>. I&#8217;ll deal with most of the other gear in a separate article, in this one I want to look more at the trip and the packraft. Finally, instead of my DSLR I used a <a href="http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B0036GGM7U?ie=UTF8&tag=hikiinfinl-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1638&creative=6742&creativeASIN=B0036GGM7U">Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ10,</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.de/e/ir?t=hikiinfinl-21&l=as2&o=3&a=B0036GGM7U" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />a fine little camera which geo-tags all photos automatically, and has a Full HD video function, as you&#8217;ll see!<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Uk46oXmKXKRK5saVUS8ErnuaAsOEDbUjS8lvO9CZbwA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TFXEIajwwlI/AAAAAAAAC8k/lW8BYCYy2SI/s800/P1020584.JPG" /></a><br /><br />The idea was to walk 25 km from Kuru to the Helvetinjärvi Nationalpark, camp at the Heinälahti campsite, and in the morning paddle the 24 km Haukkajoen Reitti back to Kuru. The first part of the plan, walking from Kuru to Heinälahti, was pretty uneventful. It was cloudy and rained a bit every now and then, and I was happy about that - the six weeks of heat we had here in Finland are completely unbearable; and anyone who tells me there is no such thing as climate change I tell to wake up. <br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Ip8cYQDXf6MnMfJjbdle2s67cZqn2lEo--4ktzb3JY4?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TFXEFJuHSBI/AAAAAAAAC8c/uBskg7P19QQ/s800/P1020550.JPG" /></a><br />Passed by some fields as I left Kuru.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/007nEjCoEEmo9ZL0vJhvUXNGqEwmuKyoToIZtyDdmYo?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TFXECgGvRRI/AAAAAAAAC8U/hWP_y52pQLk/s800/P1020535.JPG" /></a><br />Bumblebee enjoying sweet nectar.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve walked this stretch so often that I didn&#8217;t even bother with a map anymore, I know it so well by now that I just enjoyed the scenery along the trail and was happy to pick nature&#8217;s offerings where they presented themselves.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/TcE7B7Ud8HkwkM-Qgk6jiXuaAsOEDbUjS8lvO9CZbwA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TFhLafV95lI/AAAAAAAAC_c/91M4Iu36-4o/s800/P1020619.JPG" /></a><br />Raspberries.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/ZOaH1VIVFocwJB3UADvfQ3uaAsOEDbUjS8lvO9CZbwA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TFhLcZFZcjI/AAAAAAAAC_g/cO-qOHyowQs/s800/P1020635.JPG" /></a><br />Lingonberries.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/aQIsNw6y45-7GnOMnzUVF3uaAsOEDbUjS8lvO9CZbwA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TFhLdxkna8I/AAAAAAAAC_k/tDw6lV5CS9Y/s800/P1020605.JPG" /></a><br />Forest strawberries.<br /><br />Even if I wasn&#8217;t super quick and made a few detours (one spring was completely dry so I asked some people who just arrived at their Mökki [Finnish for summer cottage] if I could get some water from their spring, and I took a one kilometer detour as I went to check out a place where I would come by the next day) I arrived at Heinälahti at 19.30 o&#8217;clock.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/zlIayMVZURBf9l6lC9bDj3uaAsOEDbUjS8lvO9CZbwA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TFZTq_4d2oI/AAAAAAAAC-4/PFieL7JbgHE/s800/P1020607.JPG" /></a><br />Ants using a man-made bridge to cross the river.<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/cutEtNmE1l6N7UA3CVnEynuaAsOEDbUjS8lvO9CZbwA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TFZSFRI8S0I/AAAAAAAAC9M/fGYYUH7rpcs/s800/P1020748.JPG" /></a><br />Early evening at camp.<br /><br />By the time I arrived the sun came out once in a while, so I stripped down naked and took a swim in the lake. There was no one around, and knowing that most Finns won&#8217;t arrive too late at camp, I had no worries. I then walked to the woodshed to pick up two logs, grabbed my <a href="http://gransfors.com/htm_eng/index.html"target="_blank">Gränsfors Bruks</a> Mini Hatchet and started to chop wood for my Bushbuddy Ultra. It was great fun, and because I &#8220;forgot&#8221; to take pegs I looked for some dead wood which, with the help of hatchet and puukko, were transformed into kickass pegs for my tent. I had it pitched in a couple of minutes, and started to roll out my mat and let my quilt loft, while I continued to chop wood and brew water for my cacao.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/zw2CwbSmn90HzWx8HORdT3uaAsOEDbUjS8lvO9CZbwA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TFZRzayKhoI/AAAAAAAAC9E/4ygFqoRjpYU/s800/P1020733.JPG" /></a><br />Home, Sweet Mosquito-free Home!<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/g8QudJveSBi921KOLPX14nuaAsOEDbUjS8lvO9CZbwA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TFZS3mRmrWI/AAAAAAAAC98/NI069dKkVmo/s800/P1020694.JPG" /></a><br />Outdoor Pyrotechnics.<br /><br />I slept OK. I tried a new mat, which was great though if you roll it out over some tree roots (somehow at the campsite there was not a single spot found to be rootless) you&#8217;ll only get so much sleep. At about 4.30 o&#8217;clock in the morning the sun started to rise, so I got up to take a good look at it, listen to the bird calls and enjoy the tranquility.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/h7uS-q1Se6tHvi2FYPNksHuaAsOEDbUjS8lvO9CZbwA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TFZRsJAiIBI/AAAAAAAAC9A/tZwR-klSIU8/s800/P1020722.JPG" /></a><br />What&#8217;s The Story, Morning Glory.<br /><br />After half an hour I decided to catch a bit more sleep, and around eight I got up to enjoy the new day, eat breakfast and drink coffee before I set out to packraft.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/NbOntU9tEDgPj7i2QkTq3HuaAsOEDbUjS8lvO9CZbwA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TFZSeOGqPuI/AAAAAAAAC9k/IVRLODAP3Zc/s800/P1020754.JPG" /></a><br />Delicious breakfast.<br /><br />After breakfast I set out to inflate the packraft, pack up, and start paddling. But I wouldn&#8217;t be me if I didn&#8217;t use my time to to share with you my first strokes (OK, not really my first strokes, as I was paddling a few times before on lakes at home & in Helsinki, but it was the first time out backpacking!) in a packraft. Thus lean back and enjoy the video.<br /><br /><object width="800" height="450"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=13878260&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=ff9933&amp;fullscreen=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;loop=0" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=13878260&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=ff9933&amp;fullscreen=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;loop=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="800" height="450"></embed></object><br /><br />I was fairly optimistic with my estimation of speed in the packraft. Now, six weeks of heat meant the lake, and hence the river, was about 50 cm lower than usual, and so I needed to walk all the &#8220;white water&#8221; sections as they were too low to float through. Add in an unbelievable amount of beaver dams (I recall at least six, and plenty of downed trees which obstructed the river) and my speed must have been something like 2 km per hour - I was calculating at least with four, if not five. <br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/d2oR5SSnObSQ24BzqFdlQnuaAsOEDbUjS8lvO9CZbwA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TFhLnID3RKI/AAAAAAAAC_o/Ef2pGp-wUEQ/s800/P1020758.JPG" /></a><br />Ready!<br /><br />My last bus back to Tampere went at 17.05 o&#8217;clock, and with a speed of 2 km per hour I won&#8217;t make it before ten to Kuru - far to late even for hitchhiking. So, after 8 km of packrafting I sadly packed up the raft and paddle, and started the walk back to Kuru. I decided to walk the road and not the trail, as I was hoping to be able to hitch a ride to Kuru - because 17 km in two and half hours were just too much. Happily a young boy on a Quad gave me a short lift, and a friendly lady gave me another short lift to the bus stop; but I still walked 14 km in two and half hours - something that I felt as soon as I arrived at home. <br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/xbrkJnKzXmxbXefDixsckXuaAsOEDbUjS8lvO9CZbwA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TFZSJkRRZBI/AAAAAAAAC9Q/ANL9mDjmZiA/s800/P1020761.JPG" /></a><br />Paddling.<br /><br />So in conclusion, my thoughts on packrafting: It&#8217;s awesome and opens up completely new possibilities to enjoy the outdoors and go new routes. For me, who has been enjoying <a href="http://packrafting.blogspot.com/"target="_blank">Roman Dial&#8217;s adventures</a>, was happy to see that <a href="http://www.fjaderlatt.se/2009/09/packrafting-from-abisko-to-nikkaluokta.html"target="_blank">Jörgen from Fjäderlätt also packrafts in Sweden</a>, and looked as <a href="http://lightweightoutdoors.com/?p=325"Target="_blank">Phil</a> and <a href="http://www.andyhowell.info/Colin-Ibbotson/index.html"target="_blank">Colin</a> introduced packrafting to the UK last year, I knew that I will get one for this summer. <br /><br />I got the Alpaca raft, with a Spraydeck. The weight is 2513 g, and the Sawyer paddle is 860 g, which is 3373 g together. As you see in the video, I did not bother with a life vest. That might be for some a strict no-go, but I don&#8217;t have one and also didn&#8217;t find a light enough life vest. I also knew where I was going and what was to be expected, and therefore knew that a life vest won&#8217;t be necessary. If you&#8217;re more security conscious than me, and will paddle in proper white water, take a vest. Back to the raft. I intend to go to Lapland and paddle in some decent rivers this rest-of-summer or autumn, depending on my time (We remember: Hendrik does a Wilderness Guide education and works as well). I think I prefer the white water, fast flowing rivers overs the lakes, so a trip to Lapland seems in order; I&#8217;m thinking about the Karhunkierros or going down the river along the Finnish-Swedish border&#8230;<br /><br />The packraft is of course ideally suited to go paddling on the lake - it is what I do in the evenings after work, the lake being 150 m from my front door. But rivers mean you can lean back a bit more, paddle a bit less, be lazy & enjoy the landscape. As you saw, I went barefoot in the raft, but later, as the carrying increased, put the shoes back on. I didn&#8217;t mind the wet shoes or pants, it was quite hot and thus a good way of cooling down. Thanks to the Spraydeck there was not much water in the raft, and once I improve my paddling style there shouldn&#8217;t be too much water on top of it either. I also realized that speed will (likely) only be high on fast flowing rivers. If you have to paddle, calculate with two or three kilometers per hour, likely less. <br /><br />Well, that are my initial thoughts after my first trip. I enjoyed myself immensely, and am looking forward to more packrafting in the future, it really is a great way to enjoy the outdoors and see nature from a very different perspective. I hope this was a good first look into packrafting for those interested, and shows that with the help of a little raft and some willingness to try something new, one can experience the outdoors in new ways!<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/jcigKBVZTI2miCNPqV7gt63_ZFCDtugbu0uvLrhUYgM?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TAvbcoi3rrI/AAAAAAAACt4/WzGDIlgHSgA/s800/P1020255.JPG" /></a><br />Yours truly, proud like a god in his packraft =)<br /><br />Remember, you now can <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Nordic-Lightpacking/128701720487438">become a Fan of Hiking in Finland and Nordic Lightpacking on Facebook</a>!</div>
