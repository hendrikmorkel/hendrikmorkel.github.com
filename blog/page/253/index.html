Another scorching summer week has passed, another week in which I am looking forward to the cool and darker autumn nights, and sunny winter days. The most talked about topic this week certainly is the OutDoor fair in Friedrichshafen, which showcase a few interesting pieces for the UL & lightweight aficionado. Lets dive in.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.outdoor-show.com/od-en/supporting-programme/outdoor-industry-award.php"target="_blank">OutDoor Industry Award 2010</a> showcases a couple of interesting products for the UL backpacker, for example the Inov-8 bare-grip 200 trailrunners and the Terra Nova EquipmentLaser Ultra-1 tent. For more information on the news from Friedrichshafen, check <a href="http://www.fjaderlatt.se/2010/07/news-from-friedrichshafen-part-3.html#more/"target="_blank">Fjäderlätt</a> and <a href="http://hrxxlight.com/?p=510/"target="_blank">hrXXLight</a>.<br /><br />Hamilton from Traverse Japan gives us a run-down on how he made his <a href="http://traversejapan.wordpress.com/2010/07/14/whats-cheaper-lighter-and-more-breathable-than-an-e-bivy-my-myog-tyvek-bivy/"target="_blank">tyvek bivy</a> and if you&#8217;re looking for an easy and cheap MYOG project, this might just be it.<br /><br />If a tyvek bivy is too simple for you as a MYOG project, check out <a href="http://sheddwellersmoments.blogspot.com/2010/07/new-tarp-catenary-cut-solo-tarp.html"target="_blank">Shed Dweller&#8217;s Catenary Cut Solo Tarp</a>. You should also check his blog during the coming eek to see if this tarp can withstand a decent pounding!<br /><br />Robin from BackpackBaseCamp makes a comparison between the <a href="http://backpackbasecamp.blogspot.com/2010/07/evernew-dx-vs-trail-designs-caldera.html"target="_blank">Trail Designs Caldera Cone and the Evernew DX</a> and if you&#8217;re in the market for a stove this little comparison is certainly worth a look.<br /><br />Adam from <a href="http://krudmeister.blogspot.com/2010/07/trttytict1250-miles-wmld.html"target="_blank">FSTPKR gives us a lo-down on the gear</a> he&#8217;s going to be using on his trips this summer, and if you&#8217;re in the market for MLD goodies make sure to give this article a good read!<br /><br />Mark gives us <a href="http://backpackingnorth.blogspot.com/2010/07/afton-shakedown-what-went-right-and.html"target="_blank">a shakedown on the gear</a> he used on his last hike, and illuminates why it is useful to test gear before you go on a longer trip.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/6vWdo5n57ChNSihux-JpIF4Au29CDYBoDzrGzVsKKHA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S8MPwyb8q0I/AAAAAAAACL8/4Pg5hwSYazA/s800/P1030952.jpg" /></a><br /><br />One of the best trip reports this week was for me certainly Matthias&#8217; <a href="http://uloutdoors.wordpress.com/2010/07/05/island-geduldigkeit-und-wie-alles-anders-kommt/"target="_blank">Iceland report</a>. Spectacular photos and a good story have put Iceland back on my radar, and should also put it on yours.<br /><br />If Iceland is too far away, then maybe a trip to the <a href="http://backpackingbongos.wordpress.com/2010/07/12/ben-more-scramble-via-achioch-isle-of-mull/"target="_blank">Isle of Mull and a scramble up Ben More</a> like James did it is more up your alley. Lush green hills, waterfalls and spectacular views are certainly to be had.<br /><br />Robin delivers <a href="http://blogpackinglight.wordpress.com/2010/07/17/lake-district-july-2010-part-1/"target="_blank">part one of his Lake District report</a>, showing that lush green hills and waterfalls also can be seen there - besides a bunch of rabbits!<br /><br />Dondo&#8217;s <a href="http://dondo1.wordpress.com/2010/07/17/eaglesmere/"target="_blank">Eaglesmere</a> trip report is full of beautiful photos of wildflowers, lakes and some surprises.<br /><br />If you prefer lush green mountains in Japan, have a look at Hana&#8217;s accent of <a href="http://hana2009.wordpress.com/2010/07/09/the-cocks-comb-鶏冠山-a-double-billing/"target="_blank">The Cock&#8217;s Comb</a>.<br /><br />Cedar & Sand lets us take part on his trail run (!) along he <a href="http://cedarandsand.blogspot.com/2010/07/trans-zion.html"target="_blank">Trans-Zion</a>, that beautiful area in Utah. A very impressive achievement, and great photos!<br /><br />Trotten mit Hut takes us along on the <a href="http://trottenmithut.blogspot.com/2010/07/der-leo-jobst-wanderweg.html"target="_blank">Leo-Jobst trail</a> and shows that hiking in Germany is as beautiful as anywhere else. I love the sight of old ruins & &#8220;Fachwerkhäuser&#8221;, and being able to pick cherries on the trail is splendid in this weather!<br /><br /><a href="http://ultralightbackpacking.blogspot.com/2010/07/splitboarding-and-backpacking-in-july.html"target="_blank">Sam combined backpacking and snowboarding (in July!)</a> on his last trip, and it certainly makes me want to take my board up some proper mountains and draw some lines into the snow.<br /><br />That UL backpacking is not only useful if you want to go snowboarding shows Yeti, who takes his Mountain bike on a <a href="http://yetirides.blogspot.com/2010/07/hot-riding-pt-1.html"target="_blank">trip in southern Finland on a hot weekend</a>  - some very beautiful scenery to be seen, so check it out!<br /><br />And the final trip report is part two of <a href="http://www.nielsenbrownoutdoors.com/2010/07/along-nordkalottleden-part-2.html"target="_blank">Roger&#8217;s epic Nordkalottleden Saga: Gaskashytta to Jerta</a>, taking us further along this great route in the magic north!<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/c1Tky60UVxtwLQtdJAuM9OvluymBbGzMyVISrmnPGN4?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/SvCF-swS0aI/AAAAAAAAAyA/EWEMXDyVnAE/s800/IMG_3123.JPG" /></a><br /><br />If you&#8217;d like to improve your navigation skills or learn the basics, give the <a href="http://www.cardinalpoints.co.uk/"target="_blank">Cardinal Points</a> website a visit, it is a a map and compass simulation to teach navigation skills. <br /><br />A very special article to close this week is <a href="http://www.stevenhorner.com/?p=899"target="_blank">Steven&#8217;s piece on how the outdoors made him who he is today</a>.

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
As you likely have noticed, the amount of posts has gone down a bit in the last months. Reason is simply that my business takes a lot of time at the moment, and with upcoming life changes in August time will be even more limited. Time to sit back, and outline what will happen here over the next months.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/HtmlVtopPR4tRLTKaaeGrA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S-A3_s5_ZYI/AAAAAAAACYs/6tWJgbFsb3E/s800/P1040476.jpg" /></a><br /><br />First and foremost, I will start an education to become a <span style="font-weight:bold;">wilderness guide</span> in mid-August. It is a ten months, full-time education and besides learning in the classroom expeditions are part of the curriculum. A two week autumn expedition to north-eastern Russia, a two week solo skiing expedition in Lapland in winter, a canoe expedition and other trips will certainly teach me new skills and make a superb basis to show how far ultralight gear can go. I aim to use UL gear for this education, and show that one doesn&#8217;t need 80l backpacks and bombproof gear. Also, I will be running <a href="http://www.korpiconsulting.com">my company</a> at the same time, so I will be very busy and might not always find the time to write interesting and exciting posts. The aim with this course is to have the skills, knowledge and legal requirements to offer [UL] courses in the future - but that is so far off that I will tell about this at another time!<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Ultralight from A - Z</span> is a new video series I am working on. In this 26 part series I am going to explain Ultralight backpacking from A to Z in a video for each letter, from skills to gear and philosophy I am hoping to explain ultralight backpacking it in an easy and understandable manner. It will start in the autumn, so stay tuned!<br /><br />In the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Gear Reviews</span> department I have a steady pipeline of new and exciting gear to test and tell you about. I hope to be able to write a gear article a week, it is just about finding the time.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Trip Reports</span> are still what I love best, and I aim to tell and show you more about the beautiful Finnish landscapes which I enjoy so much. The expeditions will be covered as well, so there should be a few very interesting reports coming up.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Advertising</span>. You might have seen the box on the right, this is an experiment I am trying at the moment - I saw it on <a href="http://sectionhiker.com/">sectionhiker</a>&#8217;s blog and decided to try it out myself. It helps to pay for trips & running the website, but will have no influence on the content. If I find it doesn&#8217;t work or is not worth the trouble, I will remove it. Also the <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/p/about-faq.html">Donate button on the About page</a> is there for the same idea - content will remain free, but for those who would like to give there is now the opportunity.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Interviews</span>. With already <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/p/interviews.html">23 interviews</a> on this site one might think I ran out of interesting people to talk to. Well, that is not the case and I have over half a dozen interviews in the pipeline at the moment, so that is a good reason to become a Follower or subscribe to the RSS feed to stay tuned and up-to-date!<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/mMJ1RO_t9OWn_6Ybb3m3Zw?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S-A38jmuKPI/AAAAAAAACYo/2jVIXNz9kGY/s800/P1040474.jpg" /></a><br /><br />That are my plans for the near future. I would like to thank you all for reading and commenting, it is very rewarding to see that so much people enjoy the site, it keeps me motivated to produce top-notch content. I am looking forward to you questions, comments and observations =)

Time for another interview. I look over the border of the UL universe and had a chat with Eric Hardee from <a href="http://rivendellmountainworks.com/">Rivendell Mountain Works</a>, who produces the renown Jensen Pack, a lightweight and durable pack aimed for alpine and mountaineering adventures. Read on how the company was established in the 70s, wrapped up in the 80s and started again in the new millennia! <br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/C7sesImMXmD64z7u_WPivjWiupv70N-RGKSfyQFBX78?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TDt_SdVq58I/AAAAAAAAC5s/DfInPayZdbI/s800/EW%20Spire.jpg" /></a><br />Eric on the EW Spire.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Eric, please briefly introduce yourself and tell us who you are. Since when are you backpacking, and how did you start? How often are you out backpacking nowadays?</span><br /><br />Thanks Hendrik, it is an honor to be included amongst other cottage manufacturers who seem more established than myself. My operation is still very much a start-up.<br /> <br />I started backpacking as a rather young lad in a summer camp in NH. Backpacking trips were a great way to escape the repression of the day to day camp routine. I continued my outdoor activity in college through the UVA outing club and took up rockclimbing, cross country skiing and winter mountaineering. I landed a summer job with the National Park Service and went on to have a 17 year seasonal career as a backcountry and climbing ranger. It was an honor to serve as a seasonal ranger in Olympic, Wrangell-St. Elias and Mt. Rainier National Parks. My passion became Alpine climbing and most of my trips were focused on that activity. Strictly backpacking trips became rather rare. I still try to get out on an alpine adventure once a year but job and family commitments tend to fill up most of my time.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Are you a UL backpacker? If so, what is your typical baseweight?</span><br /><br />Because I tended to do technical climbing trips, ultralight backpacking was not my forte. However, it has also become a passion of mine to do super long, fast day excursions where traveling light is essential. We regularly ran trails as rangers long before that became a sport unto itself.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Please tell us where the name &#8220;Rivendell Mountain Works&#8221; comes from, and what it stands for.</span><br /><br />Larry Horton started RMW in the early 70’s and used the name of Rivendell, the mythical home of the elves in Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings trilogy. I presume that part of the reason for the name choice was that vision of an imaginary, pristine, secret “shangra-la”. There has long been a quest in exploration history to find  “shangra-la”. A great account of such a spritual and exploration quest is documented in the book “Heart of the World” by Ian Baker. I am continuing with the suggestion of that idea by coining the expression “may a Jensen pack be on your back when you find your Rivendell”.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/VAzeRWvlFx-WHtfLopvn_jWiupv70N-RGKSfyQFBX78?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TDt_ZBhby8I/AAAAAAAAC58/FzdWK-c6gJM/s800/production.jpg" /></a><br />Materials cut out, ready for production.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Rivendell Mountain Works makes the very acclaimed Jensen Pack™, introduced back in the 1971. Can you tell us a bit more how the rucksack was developed and changed over time? </span><br /><br />Don Jensen designed the pack in the late 60’s when there were few choices for packs that could carry substantial gear and also be suitable for technical climbing. The intent was to keep the load stable and as close to the back as possible to minimize the effect on the balance of the climber. By eliminating a frame of any kind the pack is also more flexible to the movement and contortion of the climber. It was probably also the first “soft pack” to allow much of the load to be transferred to the hips, reducing shoulder fatigue common to all other soft packs of the era. The evolution of the pack design has mostly been limited to improving materials, construction and ease of loading. The actual design has changed very little, since Don’s original concept was nearly perfect.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">When did you join the company, how has it developed since and where you are headed for the future? </span><br /><br />Rivendell ceased business as a day-to day company in 1981. I met the subsequent owner, Don Wittenberger, in 1985 and worked out an arrangement to continue making packs, selling by word of mouth. Due to a resurgence of interest in vintage and traditional gear, I relaunched a commercial presence in 2007. The packs were the mainstay of the original Rivendell, and my goal has been to revitalize that line of packs, maintaining the high quality by remaining a small, micro-cottage industry. Currently I am working full time in this endeavor.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/XwAMgh1DIrCPDmPDJvABaTWiupv70N-RGKSfyQFBX78?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TDt_Vzv2WEI/AAAAAAAAC50/9bkDNvFndZc/s800/Packman.jpg" /></a><br />In the workshop.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Eric, we love to be let in on the work-in-progress stuff! Can you let us know what kind of new products you&#8217;re working on the moment?</span><br /><br />I’m developing a top pocket for the Jensen Pack line, which will give the pack an added convenience and functionality when using the pack in a backpacking or mountaineering mode. Because my operation has been a solo endeavor it has been difficult to work designing into the production schedule. Now that I have a quality contract sewing person I hope to have more time for this.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">How works the R&D at Rivendell Mountain Works, do you have a need yourself that you try to fix, or do some of your clients inspire you for new products and ask you for solutions to their problems?</span><br /><br />Both, the top pocket is a perfect illustration of this. From my years of carrying the Jensen pack I knew this would be a great feature and recent customers have been asking for it as well.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/LRhgceAx1GDMOvX20MDzMTWiupv70N-RGKSfyQFBX78?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TDt_Wqzr_HI/AAAAAAAAC54/ibKyhluYqt4/s800/Mariposa%20packs.jpg" /></a><br />Jensen Mariposa packs in the making.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">What is the bestseller from Rivendell Mountain Works, and where do your customer come from?</span><br /><br />Historically, the Jensen pack has been the mainstay of Rivendell products probably because it has remained one of the most unusual packs on the market. I have been shipping packs all over the US as well as overseas. Japan is a big market and there have been individual orders from England, France, Finland, New Zealand, Korea and Malaysia.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Are you in touch with other cottage manufacturers in Europe, the USA, Japan or other places?</span><br /><br />I have had some limited contact with other cottage manufacturers and intend to do more of that in the very near future since the resource is a valuable one.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/SYv2ajHey64ZS6ytTawG3jWiupv70N-RGKSfyQFBX78?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TDt_Z6jOLVI/AAAAAAAAC6A/15oYYDzky9k/s800/sewing%20room.jpg" /></a><br />In the sewing room.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">What is your own favorite backpack, sleep system and shelter? Any other favourite piece of gear which you always carry with you?</span><br /><br />I have carried a Jensen pack exclusively since about 1977. Often I still use a Camp 7 Arete VBL down sleeping bag. My favorite tent for many years was the Stephenson (Warmlite) 3R. Stephenson tents are by far the lightest tents for their size/volume considering that the tents are suitable for winter mountaineering and extreme conditions.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">When and where was your last longer backpacking trip, and what was your baseweight? Are you planning to get out for a trip soon, and enjoy the summer season?</span><br /><br />My last multi-day backpacking trip was a 3 day solo in ONP, several years ago. I’m not a fanatic about weighing my pack but I’ll guess it was about 30 lbs. <br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/gOPDO5QYiWz7DGtc5x-UzzWiupv70N-RGKSfyQFBX78?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TDt_TZKY2GI/AAAAAAAAC5w/fpWSw2xQKZE/s800/Cache%20Peak%20Summit.jpg" /></a><br />Eric with a Cache on Peak Summit.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Do you think ultralight backpacking will become more popular and break into the mass market, or will it continue to be something for a small group of people?</span><br /><br />It seems like there is more general awareness of ultralight backpacking as a style that ecompasses minimalism. Ultralight gear itself is becoming much more popular and because of that many backpackers will end up with lighter packs but probably not fully embracing the ideas behind traveling without many things….<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Eric, I thank you for taking the time to answer my questions =)</span><br /><br /><a href="http://flattr.com/thing/985/Hiking-in-Finland-Ultralight-Backpacking-Blog" target="_blank"><img src="http://api.flattr.com/button/button-compact-static-100x17.png" title="Flattr this" border="0" /></a></div>
