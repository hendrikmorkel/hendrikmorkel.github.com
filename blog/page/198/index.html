  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Yesterday I went to the post to pick up a small package from <a href="http://www.optimusstoves.com/">Optimus</a>, in it the tiny new Optimus Crux Lite Solo Cook System. This set is completely new for 2010 and will be my first dabbling in gas stoves. No, I will not leave my beloved wood burning stoves behind, but in winter I find, with the cold I am even more eager to get something hot inside my mouth and thus a gas stove will not only add speed, but also convenience - I do not need to collect wood and get right down to the business of melting snow and boiling water for food. <br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/iVJ-wO2vYm2H-QplSCnrqg?authkey=Gv1sRgCNSI8vbHlaCH4gE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S4vziFUsxJI/AAAAAAAABwU/dKQ3iwUXAog/s800/IMG_6057.JPG" /></a><br />A nice small box, full of win.<br /><br />Lets get down to the most important thing first: Weight. The whole set is 269 g, and the separate weights are as follows:<br /><br />- Mesh bag: 12 g<br />- Crux Lite: 74 g<br />- Crux Lite bag: 7 g<br />- Sauce pan: 122 g<br />- Fry pan: 54 g<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.optimusstoves.com/en/optimus-products/products/katadynshopconnect/optimus-outdoor-kocher/optimus-crux-lite/">Crux Lite</a> promises to be stable for the pots and would even give me the opportunity to simmer food rather easily. The <a href="http://www.optimusstoves.com/en/optimus-products/products/katadynshopconnect/optimus-kochgeschirr-und-besteck/optimus-terra-solo/">sauce pan</a> has a pouring lip and you can fit in 600 ml of liquid, that&#8217;s plenty for a meal and a cuppa. The frying pan allows me to make eggs with bacon on the trail and be the envy of every other hiker, or, more likely, will be the lid for the bigger pan. The whole set packs small (13 cm high and around 11 cm in diameter if you need to know) and also fits a 110 g cartridge inside it, together with the Crux Lite and a folding spoon if that&#8217;s what you use. The green plastic handles ensure you don&#8217;t burn your fingers, so you don&#8217;t need to use gloves. Nifty, and I love the colour. <br /><br />You know unboxing photo sets of gadgets? Well, what follows is the unboxing and putting together photo set of the Optimus Crux Lite Solo Cook System, a new stage in nerdiness brought to UL backpacking =)<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/wzfhdPz548HgkJNWU977kg?authkey=Gv1sRgCNSI8vbHlaCH4gE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S4vzl9fi36I/AAAAAAAABwY/XlHmEOSPOKg/s800/IMG_6059.JPG" /></a><br />In its mesh bag.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/eArUgoAO_oYj32MDY4JWZA?authkey=Gv1sRgCNSI8vbHlaCH4gE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S4vzqzlZ-MI/AAAAAAAABwc/ClSnHWWzlzE/s800/IMG_6061.JPG" /></a><br />Without the mesh bag, the suspense rises.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/1nV2Rko8K-FgXEm5Q-zjLg?authkey=Gv1sRgCNSI8vbHlaCH4gE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S4vzvjM1IqI/AAAAAAAABwg/CyR97Vj5Ufs/s800/IMG_6068.JPG" /></a><br />Frying pan, sauce pan and the Crux Lite, ready for action.<br /><br />I can&#8217;t yet tell you anything more about the Crux Lite and how it performs, as its not advised to use it inside and with the slush on the streets and the slush coming down from heaven I wasn&#8217;t able to try it out yet. And that&#8217;s where you come in. I will organize a Passaround of the Crux Lite Solo Cook System, and you yourself get to test it. Curious? Then read on.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/ybx7iijpLpXXTrEkME5R3w?authkey=Gv1sRgCNSI8vbHlaCH4gE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S4vz4ueNuUI/AAAAAAAABws/rbebaHufnQ0/s800/IMG_6072.JPG" /></a><br /><br />Instead of me doing my usual routine I&#8217;d like to pass the Crux Lite set around to five different readers and have them test it. If you&#8217;re a total newbie to gas stoves like me or a seasoned veteran, anyone can apply for a test of the set. So how does this work? I send out the set to the first reader, and he gets to play around with it for two weeks. You need to have access to gas cartridges (I can&#8217;t send those) and you need to be willing to pay the postage to send it to the next person, but besides that its completely free to you and allows you to test the stove without shelling out the money first. After your two weeks of playing you send the set forward to the next in line, and drop me a short email about what you thought of the set, which will be published here on the blog. In that way we can collect different viewpoints on the Optimus Crux Lite Solo set, and get a nice review together. <br /><br />You want to take part in the Passaround? Great! What you need to do is leave a comment underneath (preferrably not anonymous), and next week Monday (8th of March) around noon I will randomly pick the five people who get to test the Crux Lite Solo set. While I&#8217;d love to have this Passaround open to everyone, sending packages, even small ones like these, is expensive, so I&#8217;d would like to limit it to Scandinavia and the Baltics as that keeps the costs for those involved low (except someone wants to share the postage to them if living outside of that area, then you&#8217;re welcome to comment as well). Before you hit the comment button, I&#8217;d like to remember you - you should be able to get a gas cartridge for the test in your town, you need to be willing to pay the shipping costs to the next person, and you&#8217;re fine with sending me a short statement of your opinion, possibly with a photo or two. So, now off you go!</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
What defines lightweight, ultralight and superultralight? These questions pop up time and again on forums and on blogs, so I thought it might be interesting to delve a bit deeper into this subject. Its going to be highly subjective, full of crazy weight calculations and definitions, so if you could care less about how heavy the stuff is which you carry through the outdoors you better don&#8217;t read on. For all others, I am looking forward to a lively discussion!  <br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/rpGwmcodXgNl3ebqvD5K4A?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S4uYK7ZyV8I/AAAAAAAABvs/-AD6Sh6A-F4/s800/IMG_5261.JPG" /></a><br /><br />There&#8217;s a lot of different interpretations of what is UL, SUL and lightweight, and what I found a good definition is<br /><br />Lightweight = 12-20 pounds<br />Ultralight = 6-11 pounds <br />Superultralight = 5 pounds or less<br /><br />as posted by the <a href="http://jolly-green-giant.blogspot.com/">Jolly Green Giant</a>. I live in the metric system, which, with its logical steps of tens, hundreds and thousands is a lot more appealing to me than ounces, pounds and whatnot. In that system the above would translate to the following:<br /><br />Lightweight = 5,44 - 9,07 kg<br />Ultralight = 2,72 - 4,99 kg<br />Superultralight = 2,27 kg or less<br /><br />For the sake of simplicity, and my love for even numbers, I&#8217;d round them up/ down to <br /><br />Lightweight = 5,0 - 10,0 kg<br />Ultralight = 3,0 - 5,0 kg<br />Superultralight = anything under 3 kg<br /><br />That&#8217;s completely my own suggestion, and you will see many varied discussions and definitions on this topic. But I have more to say than rounding some number up and down, so bear with me. On the last trip, which was in the sign of UL, of course at some point the discussion turned to weights, and how the whole definition is a bit dodgy and open to interpretation. What we discussed about is that I with my Size S in clothing have it a lot easier to reach a UL weight of someone who&#8217;s 195 cm tall and wears XXL. My small size is a benefit in every piece of gear, because I can sleep under a smaller tarp, use a smaller backpack and quilt, a shorter pad, I don&#8217;t need to eat as much and the list continues. So I think someone should start to make a clear definition on those weights, and also on deviations of it. <br /><br />Before I dive into deviations, lets shortly discuss the different ways of defining the weight. You got the base weight, which includes everything in the backpack minus consumables like food, water, fuel and toiletries. This leaves out the stuff you wear on your body - the clothes you wear, your hat, sunglasses, watch, camera, GPS, shoes, trekking poles, etc. To include them and the consumables, one could use the Skin Out Weight. Everything is in there when using the skin out weight; food, water, the clothes you wear and everything else. I believe the new definition of base weight should be the sum of base weight (everything you carry in the backpack minus consumables) and the stuff you wear on your body. Why? Because everything else is a sham in my opinion. You carry what you wear, and thus it should be included from the start and not as a separate point in gear lists. The other weight I would calculate and list is consumables, the food, water, and toiletries. Those two weights will be what I personally will be using from now on, with mentioning of what is worn in the backpack and on the body but with including both as one point when calculating the base weight.<br /><br />Back to weight and deviations then. My suggestion would be that size Medium (M) is set as the middle standard, to which the above weights (the UL/ SUL/ Lightweight definitions) apply. You could even go a step further and define it so that someone of a certain size (height) is linked to that, but maybe its better to keep it simple. So if a Size M wants to go UL, he should aim for a three to five kilogram weight. And here the deviation to the current system could come in: <br /><br />- Size S => subtract 5% from M for weight limit<br />- Size M => Standard<br />- Size L => add 5% from M for weight limit<br />- Size XL => add 10% from M for weight limit<br />- Size XXL => add 15% from M for weight limit<br /><br />This might sound all hugely complicated, but in truth I think it would simplify, make the weight more personal and most importantly it would make the discussion more fair. Lets assume someone of Size S would like to go UL, then the maximum (new definition) base weight should be 5 kg * 0,95 (because he needs to subtract 5% from the M weight limit) so his max weight would be 4,75 kg. If on the other hand some who&#8217;s a Size XL wants to go UL he should aim for a (5 kg * 1,1) 5,5 kg max base weight. This allows for the extra weight his larger clothes, shoes, tent, pad, etc. are likely to incur in comparison to someone who&#8217;s a size S or M. I chose 5% as the value, not because I have done a scientific research on the differences in weights (not yet, at least ;) but because I feel that 250 g are likely a good number to accommodate the differences in the same piece of clothing if taken a number bigger or smaller.<br /><br />Well, these were my thoughts on the weight debate. To conclude, this was a nice play with numbers, and hopefully helps to clarify maybe the whole weight discussion a bit. I think using the new definition of base weight would be an improvement to the current system, as you include also what you wear and carry on your body, and so close some loopholes. The deviation system on the other hand would make the weights comparable among people of different sizes, and would not put the larger folks at a disadvantage when it comes to staying under a certain weight limit. Finally, these are just ideas and guidelines, and not the be all and end all of the weight debate. If you&#8217;re aim is to go UL and you&#8217;re happy with 5,6 kg even if that would be 600 g over the limit of what is considered UL, as long as you feel good and happy with it, don&#8217;t bother further about it. Its only numbers, after all, and if you decided to lighten up that&#8217;s the right step you&#8217;ve taken! <br /><br />Now I&#8217;m done and am looking forward to your questions, comments, and observations =)</div>

I feel it is about time that I change the URL of my blog to something easier, and with Google&#8217;s great offer of less than 10€ for a custom domain I decided to switch to a dot com domain. So, I&#8217;d like to suggest that you update your bookmark to <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/">http://www.hikinginfinland.com/</a> instead of the old http://www.hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/ - although the old URL will forward you to the new one, so you&#8217;re not missing out on anything if you read the blog from a browser, but some functions (like the Followers box on the right) might not work properly. It seems the RSS reader works just fine, but if you don&#8217;t get updates there, you might want to update it to the new domain as well. <br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/yIz-vr_paYiAV4n6J_A7Sg?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S4qis0Qj0hI/AAAAAAAABuw/85cfH0zu9UE/s800/IMG_5145.JPG" /></a><br />From the <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/02/tufwt-10-trip-report.html">last trip</a>, a VauDe Scutum aka Power Lizard UL in the background, and a LAUFBURSCHE Cuben Tanzpalast in the foreground.</div>
