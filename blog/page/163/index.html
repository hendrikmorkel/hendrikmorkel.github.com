  <div class="entry-content">The </span><a href="http://www.luontoon.fi/page.asp?Section=7494"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">Karhunkierros</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"> (&#8220;The Bear&#8217;s Round&#8221; literally, or &#8220;Bear trail&#8221; more freely translated) is Finland&#8217;s most popular and famous trail. Its 80 km lead through the unique landscapes of the </span><a href="http://www.luontoon.fi/page.asp?Section=5144"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">Oulanka</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"> National Park. You are walking nearly constantly close to water, be it lakes or rivers, through forests and swamps, and you will be climbing some of the Finnish hills.<br /><br />You can walk it from north to south or vice versa, and Martin and me took the &#8220;natural&#8221; approach of N -> S. Its even possible to traverse some parts with a canoe or rowboat, and I guess it shouldn&#8217;t be long before one sees packrafts going down the rivers - it would be a supreme place for it. You&#8217;re allowed to fish between May and September, a day pass is about 15€ and you can get them in the Visitors Centres. Because its a National Park, the &#8220;Everyman&#8217;s Right&#8221; is valid (as almost everywhere in Finland, will talk more about this in a later post) with some reservations: you should try to stay on the paths, and leave flora &amp; fauna undisturbed. You may collect berries and mushrooms, and fires are allowed at the fireplaces if there&#8217;s no forest fire warnings. Common sense stuff pretty much, which should be known by a responsible backpacker.<br /><br />The trail is very well marked, and you&#8217;re able to find a lean-to shelter or a &#8220;Mökki&#8221; = cottage every 5 to 15 km, with plenty of rest areas + fireplaces in between. I would say its difficulty is medium, the last 8 km into Ruka are a bit more exhausting because you&#8217;re going over a few hills. 

On <a href="http://www.outdoors.fi/destinations/trails/karhunkierros80km/Pages/Default.aspx">the map</a> you can see, its very close to Russia, so if you go off-trail, be sure you know what you&#8217;re doing! Orange is the Karhunkierros trail. The blue line is the Keroharjun trail, which is recommendable because of the free sauna and cottage on the trail. Its also less popular than the Karhunkierros, thus if you&#8217;re looking for some peace and quiet it might be a good alternative.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Getting there</span><br />I&#8217;ll cover another time how you can get to Finland and get around here, lets now look how to get to Kuusamo. <a href="http://www.vr.fi/fin/">VR</a> is the Finnish railway company, and they&#8217;re pretty good though expensive. The trip from Tampere to Oulu takes about five to six hours, and there you hop on the bus to Kuusamo. <a href="http://www.matkahuolto.info/lippu/fi/connectionsearch">Busses</a> are cheaper and are very punctual. Good service all around. Oulu to Kuusamo takes around three hours. I recommend taking the overnight train and then the first bus to Kuusamo. <br /><br />If you&#8217;re in a hurry, you also can fly. Helsinki - Kuusamo has a connection, and <a href="http://www.finnair.com/finnaircom/wps/portal/finnair/jump?locale=en_INT">Finnair</a> flies you in less than an hour there. <br /><br />Now you&#8217;re in Kuusamo. From here you can take the local bus up to Hautajärvi, where the northern starting point is, or to Ruka, the southern starting point, or in our case, finishing point. Its one and the same bus, so you can&#8217;t do much wrong. Its a short ride, about twenty minutes to Ruka and an additional 25 min. to Hautajärvi. I recommend asking the bus driver from Oulu to Kuusamo about the connecting bus, they usually will know or call their office to inform themselves to let you know. <br /><br />Return trip is the same, just the other way around =) I recommend writing down some bus and train connections for your &#8220;check-out&#8221; day, so you know before hand and don&#8217;t need to spent time waiting. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Day 1</span>.<br />Martin and me started our Tour on October 4th 2008. We took the night train to Oulu, had a tea at the station and hopped on the 8 o&#8217;clock bus to Kuusamo, where we arrived at 11 o&#8217;clock. There we waited for the connection bus up to Hautajärvi, where we arrived at 14.30 o&#8217;clock. Quick some photos of us at the polar circle before we started walking. <br /><br />On our first day we took it easy, and after about one and half hours we arrived at our first campsite, the Perttumakoski Laavu. Laavu is Finnish for lean-to shelter, and these, as well as the cottages, are for free and are maintained by the Finnish Forestry Ministry. <br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/?action=view&current=e837fe76.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/e837fe76.jpg" border="0" alt="Parttumakoski Laavu"></a><br />Perttumakoski Laavu and the view on the river.<

Like all lean-to shelters, it was a beautiful place, and besides the shelter and fireplace there's a wood shelter (including an axe and saw!) with plenty of wood and a dry toilet. We rolled out our mats and bags, made a fire and cooked a meal on the Trangia. And we should have slept very good that night, if it wasn't for our concern of ending up as a snack for the wolfs or bears which roam the area! So we had a light sleep, but at least we were convinced the next morning that no wild predator will eat us  =)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Day 2.</span><br />After a cup of coffee and a small breakfast we started walking. The first sight was just a short walk off the path, so we made a quick trip there.<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/?action=view&current=11699b03.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/11699b03.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/?action=view&current=92259be6.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/92259be6.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a><br />Me going down to the Rupakivi, the first sight of the day.<br /><br />We made good way, and arrived at around 16.00 o&#8217;clock at the Savilampi Mökki, where we were planning to stay for the night. <br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/?action=view&current=9a33c79a.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/9a33c79a.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a><br />Savilampi cottage from the outside&#8230;<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/?action=view&current=6b5063d1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/6b5063d1.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a><br />&#8230; and from the inside&#8230;<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/?action=view&current=8b531a99.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/8b531a99.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a><br />&#8230; and the wood shelter and fireplace in front of it. <br /><br />The Savilampi cottage is located close to the Oulanka canyon, which we decided to explore. After all, we only walked 14 km today!<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/?action=view&current=2c2f1b23.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/2c2f1b23.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a><br />The Oulanka canyon.<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/?action=view&current=b41ecbdc.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/b41ecbdc.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a><br />And the view from it. <br /><br />After a quick dip in the river, which was freezing cold, I sat down to have a closer look at the map. It was then, around 18.00 o&#8217;clock, that I realized that we should walk 22 km the following day to reach our next campsite. Because we like to take it easy, and also enjoy something of the landscape, we decided then and there to pack up and walk another 4 km to the next cottage, so that we could take it easier the following day. <br /><br />Thus so we walked in the dusk for another hour until we reached the Taivalköngäs cottage, and we were lucky, there was still a bunk free. After a delicious dinner - we were starving! - we went to sit outside with two women, and the sky cleared out and the stars were shining down on us. We slept well that night, although some folks already got up at six in the morning and they weren&#8217;t especially silent, but oh well. We tried to ignore it as good as possible, and slept for another hour or two before we got up.<br /><br />To be continued.

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<span style="font-size:100%;">I left on Saturday morning as I wasn&#8217;t able to leave on Friday. I arrived punctually at the bus station and as soon as I entered the bus it started to rain, and it shouldn&#8217;t stop till six in the evening. The bus arrived in Parkano, from where I started to walk the 19 km to the National Park. After about three kilometers a car on the opposite lane stopped and asked me where I am going. I told the driver, and he told me to get in. He turned around, and the driver told me he saw me walking from the crossroad up ahead, and thought I could need a ride - lucky me! He dropped me off at the Visitor Centre and wished me a good trip. I quickly jumped in the Visitor Centre and asked about the lean-to shelter at Rysäslammi. The time was now 11.30 and I started walking, walking in the rain.<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2795.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2795.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2801.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2801.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2804.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2804.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2806.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2806.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br />Seiseminen consists of extensive forests, bogs and esker ridges, and there was also an old croft at Kovero on my path. I met one person during the whole trip in the park. It was peaceful, and only the rain and wind were accompanying me.<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2809.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2809.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2811.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2811.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2817.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2817.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2819.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2819.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2822.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2822.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br />I was making good speed on the park&#8217;s trails, and enjoyed the ups and downs and the walks over the planks, though they were slippery. A cuckoo was calling in the distance. I was still quite dry, walking mainly on broader paths under forest cover.<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2824.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2824.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2825.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2825.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2827.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2827.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br />The landscape changed every kilometer, and I saw moss (or do you call it dosh?) in many different shades of green.<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2829.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2829.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2836.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2836.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2837.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2837.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2842.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2842.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br />The path continued and I was in good spirit. I liked the fresh smell of the wet forest, and the silence. It was clean here. It was pristine nature.<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2853.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2853.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2846.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2846.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2854.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2854.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2859.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2859.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br />After about two hours I arrived at Koverolampi, where there is a campsite and a short walk of 200 meters to the croft. I put my backpack down under a fir and walked to shore of the small lake. It was swampy, and blueberry shrubs were all around. This will be a good place in the autumn to come and collect them.<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2870.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2870.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2874.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2874.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2878.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2878.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2879.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2879.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br />I shouldered my backpack and continued to the croft, where I met the only person during this trip, a daytripper. The old croft is a cultural heritage site, and I looked into the old stables and buildings before I continued my trip to Jokiristi. Part of the path was now a nature path, and some explanatory signs were standing at the side of the path.<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2894.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2894.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2898.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2898.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2904.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2904.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br />The anthill was as tall as me, 175 cm. I was amazed, it must be a old one. On that stretch of the path, there were another three right next to the path. The ants, however, were &#8220;inside&#8221; and waiting for the rain to stop. Smart ones, as the rain increased and the drops grew bigger. So big actually, that after about four hours I was rather wet. My spirit went down, and I decided to have a break and drink a hot chocolate. At Jokiristi they were building a new shelter, and I stopped in the not finished shelter to cook my hot cacao.<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2907.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2907.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br />Yes, that helped. With fresh energy I continued, as did the rain. I reached the old mill, which was very pretty and would make a good emergency shelter.<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2909.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2909.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2915.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2915.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2917.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2917.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br />Shortly after the battery died, and I didn&#8217;t have an extra pack with me. But my spirits were again high, and after passing Liesijärvi which had a great camping place I arrived at 18.00 o&#8217;clock at the Rysäslammin lean-to shelter. The fire in front of it was burning, and I suspect that the car which passed me five minutes earlier had the guys  within it which lighted it. I was wet to the bone after six and half hours in the rain, and needed a break. After cleaning the shelter - those guys had their beer cans and garbage thrown in the landscape - I set up the trusty Trangia and cooked me a delicious dinner. About half past seven the sun decided to show itself, and while I ate I enjoyed the view on the lake where a goose was swimming its circles.<br /><br />Not feeling comfortable with the shelter being so close to the forest-road, I decided to continue another 8 km to the next shelter. I arrived at it at 22 o&#8217;clock and made a fire to dry my cloths, before I slipped into the sleeping bag and was quickly asleep.<br /><br />At six in the morning the sun shone in my face, as my shelter was on top of a hill and facing slightly east. It was a beautiful morning, with a clear blue sky and no cloud to be seen. After breakfast I broke camp and continued the last 8 km to the town of Kuru, where I had a coffee and cake. The bus would leave in two hours, so I went down to the road to try to hitch a ride. After ten minutes I was on my way back home!<br /><br />All in all it where 35,5 km, of which the majority was the Pirkan-Taival trail. Its an European long distance trail, connecting Seitseminen NP to Helvetinjärvi NP and its well marked with good possibilities to camp. I think I will need to check it out during the summer, as its bound to have a route which starts or ends in Tampere!<br /></span></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">From my <a href="http://hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/2009/05/isojarvi-trip.html">recent trip</a> to Isojärvi National Park I present thee some more wildlife pictures and stories. There was no shortage of wildlife on this trip, and as I sat down this afternoon to remember all the impressions I decided to share some additional photos.<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&current=IMG_2622.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2622.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a><br />Frog spawn<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&current=IMG_2632.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2632.jpg" border="0" alt="Isoj&amp;auml;rvi"></a><br />Groupsex and a happy onlooker<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&current=IMG_2688.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2688.jpg" border="0" alt="Isoj&amp;auml;rvi"></a><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-throated_Diver">Black-throated Diver</a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&current=IMG_2778.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2778.jpg" border="0" alt="Isoj&amp;auml;rvi"></a><br />The first spring flowers<br /><br />These weren&#8217;t all, but I was too slow to snap pictures of the other animals. A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Pheasant">common pheasant</a> was seen while walking on the grit-road. A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Woodpecker">Black Woodpecker</a> I saw on my way to the Kalalahti lean-to shelter, its pecking sound was heard already way before I finally spotted it. The Black-throated Divers - there were two couples on the Kuorejärvi lake - has an incredible <a href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/b/blackthroateddiver/index.asp">call</a> and I was first thinking that an Elk must be in the forest across the lake - how wrong I was! They also had quite show going on after dawn, running two full circles in the water around the island and slapping their wings in the water. <br /><br />There were a few more birds I saw, but being far from a expert on birds I wasn&#8217;t able to identify them. However, I managed to <a href="http://www.allaboutfrogs.org/weird/general/frogtoad.html">distinguish</a> the frogs and toads. Toads are considered frogs, but there is the sub-species of the &#8220;true toad&#8221;. I saw a common toad which disappeared into its underground shelter as I approached, not even two meters from my sleeping place. All the frogs and toads showed that it was an amazingly healthy environment I was in, as they are considered a good indicator for an intact ecosystem.<br /><br />I already mentioned the two pike earlier. I heard an Owl at night, but am not able to tell which species. Thus all in all, quite a variety of wildlife for only two days out in the forest. Sure, there was nothing huge like an Elk (of which I saw two the weekend before, as I was fishing with my father-in-law in Vaasa) or rare like a lynx or bear, though I was happily surprised about the amount of wildlife I saw. I expect it will increase even during the following weeks, as spring turns to summer. Thus I hope to be able to snap some more photos of the wildlife here in Finland on my next trips, about which I will tell you soon more. </span></div>
