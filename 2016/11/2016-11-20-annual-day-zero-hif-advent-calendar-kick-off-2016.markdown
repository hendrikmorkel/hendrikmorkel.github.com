Dear Santa,

I really missed talking to you. Twelve months is a long time of radio-silence, and I have a lot to tell you. Like all the awesome trips I have been on this year, from [Ski-touring in Lyngen](https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/05/lyngen.html) to [backpacking in the Dolomites](https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/10/autumn-backpacking-in-the-dolomites.html), 2016 has been fantastic. I spent great moments [with my family in the mountains](https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/09/family-adventures-in-the-bregenzerwald.html), and am looking very much forward to winter backpacking and other adventures. 

But lets get down to business and start talking about the upcoming holiday season and the awesome [Hiking in Finland Advent Calendar](https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/advent-calendar-2016/). I heard it is again very nicely filled with prizes worth over 5.000â‚¬, and what better way to start getting ready for it than with a sweet ADZHiFAKO package from some small companies! 

[whoopieslings.com](https://whoopieslings.com/) make a complete Hammock and Tarp Suspension Systems, and as I decided to give hammocks another chance what would be better than having a smart suspension system for it? A set of 6" whoopie slings, a pair of 6' tree huggers and a pair of toggles should make setting up my hammock a breeze!

Similar to hammocking I think it is time to step up my trailrunning again! A [VRV8 Pack](http://www.ks-ultralightgear.com/p/blog-page_13.html) from KS ultralight gear would be ideal for that - the pack is super simple yet efficient and packs all I need for a day out running in the forests and hills. It carries my poles, soft flasks or water bottles, and 8 l of gear fit into the main compartment, all with restricting movement.

One thing I have learned which should always be along is a pair of rain mitts. The [Mountain Laurel Design eVent Rain Mitts](http://www.mountainlaureldesigns.com/shop/product_info.php?cPath=37&products_id=51) are the lightest rain mitts on the market and rumour has it that if one carries a pair rain usually doesn't bother one when outside, so they're kind of a good charm, too!

Also a pair of [GooseFeet Gear Down Socks](https://goosefeetgear.com/products/1-down-socks) have been on my list for a long time - not just because I get awfully could feet at camp in winter, but also because they pack so tiny & light when I'm hiking throughout the day. Filled with 850 fill power DownTek down these socks keep me toasty on my winter adventures, which is especially great after a long day in boots!

And finally, a [32 oz Wide Mouth Bottle](https://www.hydroflask.com/32-oz-wide-bottle#92=20) from Hydro Flask would be swell - not just for plenty of coffee the whole day but also for keeping drinks cold in the heat. It is BPA-Free, Toxin-Free and comes with a Lifetime Warranty - so this would be the last bottle I'd ever ask for!
