Two solutions to my problem: We either make days 40 hours long, or eliminate the system of time completely. There's just not enough of it to get everything done in one day. Thus I take some time out, and leave this afternoon for a week of relaxing next to the Arctic Circle. After all, spring is here in the south thus I will go north to chase the cold and snow to get a few more nights under a tarp in, before summer and <a href="http://phil-turner.net/">Phil</a> and <a href="http://www.stevenhorner.com/">Steven</a> arrive.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/uW7cweElIJeAUzvkpLSdUjWiupv70N-RGKSfyQFBX78?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S8WzyY-Nw_I/AAAAAAAACNY/Qgx-nVBW-d8/s800/P1030913.jpg" /></a><br />Mountains and ice.<br /><br />I'll go to a cottage holiday with fiancée and her family, enjoying sauna, good food and day trips in <a href="http://outdoors.fi/page.asp?Section=5144">Oulanka National Park</a>. And as the fiancée and the parents in law are already used to me camping in the garden, I decided to take my <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/01/myog-tarp.html">MYOG tarp</a> with me to give it a spin out in the snow. There's up to 80 cm of snow still up in Ruka, and the temperatures should be between -6°C and +3°C, thus I hope walking won't be like it was in <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/04/salamajarvi-national-park-trip-report.html">Salamajärvi</a>. There's a couple of articles going online next week, so you'll get your fix of Hendrik's ramblings =) <br /><br />Enjoy the spring while I chase winter!</div>
