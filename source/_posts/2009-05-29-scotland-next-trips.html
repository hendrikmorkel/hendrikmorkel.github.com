Well, this is going to be a shout out to the UK and especially Scottish backpackers. As I mentioned earlier, I am planning to go in October for a trip with my mate to hike for a week in Scotland. </span><a href="http://backpackingbongos.wordpress.com/2009/04/26/a-scottish-coast-to-coast-evanton-to-ullapool-pt1/"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;">Backpackingbongos</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;">' Coast to Coast was the inspiration, and I would like to walk that route. However, my mate who is employed (I'm an entrepreneur and thus more flexible) only has a limited amount of time, and to get up to Evanton and back might not suit our timeframe. The alternative he suggested was the Great Glen Way. I know so much, that it is a route very close to civilization, and apparently also very well visited. Also it is well marked, and as I have zero experience with compass and map ("w00t?" I hear you say, "Suunto's from Finland, you need to know that stuff!") Evanton to Ullapool might be a challenge, though I would like the fact that we're away from civilization.<br /><br />Anyhow, I am looking for opinions on the GGW and suggestions for other routes in Scotland; we're planning to walk for a week + the days needed to travel there. October 2nd till 11th is the time we have in mind. I know there's a bunch of readers from the UK, so I hope that you can help us on choosing the right trip!<br /><br />Last weekend I was for a trip with the girl friend in a near-by nature area, I will report about it next week when I am back in Tampere (am at the moment in Vaasa at the parents-in-law's house). I am planning a trip soon, as it has been three weeks since I was last out. I was thinking of either re-visiting </span></span><a href="http://hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/2009/04/helvetinjarvi-easter-hiking-trip.html"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;">Helvetinj√§rvi</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;">, or go to </span><a href="http://luontoon.fi/page.asp?Section=5261"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;">Repovesi</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;"> or </span><a href="http://luontoon.fi/page.asp?Section=5510"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;">Evo</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;">. After I decided where to go, I just need to find the time when to go.<br /><br />In that sense, a enjoyable weekend to all readers and I am looking forward to read your suggestions!</div>
