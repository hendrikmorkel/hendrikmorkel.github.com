While Hiking in Finland is my main outlet for all outdoor related things (my personal blog being the place for everything else), I am increasingly also writing for other publications. It is fun, opens the topic up to new people, and I get paid a little for it as well. Here some recent articles I wrote.

<a href="http://www.visitfinland.com/article/escape-the-hustle-and-bustle/"target="_blank">Escape the Hustle and Bustle</a> is a trip report I wrote for the new <a href="http://www.visitfinland.com/"target="_blank">VisitFinland.com</a> website. It's photo heavy and light on text, and recounts an overnighter to Nuuksio, a National Park an hour away from Helsinki.

<a href="http://www.naturkompaniet.se/Startpage/Start.aspx"target="_blank">Naturkompaniet</a> is a Swedish chain of outdoor stores, and 365 is their free magazine. I was interviewed for their <i>Duellen</i> series, in which two people with opposite standpoints discuss the merits of their POV. In this case I took the side for Ultralight Backpacking, while Lars Fält took the side for traditional backpacking. It's a polite affair, with me highlighting the skills and philosophy of UL backpacking; though Gear Nerds will be happy to see Locus Gear, Laufbursche, Hyperlite Mountain Gear, Ktabatic Gear and the BushBuddy getting a mention and illustration in the mag. It is free, so if you're in Sweden, go pick a Magazine up at your local Naturkompaniet Store!

Finally, if German language is something that you understand, and you're interested in Scandinavia, then give <a href="http://www.norrmagazin.de/"target="_blank">NORR Magazine</a> a read. For their spring issue I wrote a column; it is a more philosophical text, in which I look back on how I started to become interested in the outdoors, and wonder what my son's outdoor adventure will be like. Pick it up for 4,90€ at the book store, or <a href="http://www.norrmagazin.de/abo/"target="_blank">take out an subscription</a> and get a sweet present on top.
