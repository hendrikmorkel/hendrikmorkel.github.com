Gear used on the <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/06/ul-fellowship.html">Vålådalen</a> trip had one thing to cope with: Water. From above, beneath and the sides, it was wet all the time, and up in the fjell also the wind was very strong - good conditions to see if the lightweight kit I took can stand these conditions. For starters, have a look at my <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AuhX9Un08Z3EdEQ5WmdmZ25jTHZOQmtmd3B2SGtUZlE&hl=en">complete gear list</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/8RF_UVGcfoy58WgMhJF4d-EQ03jDDmZnzakDs5ohGsQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TAva6s0qs7I/AAAAAAAACtU/DGhmWHKn4jM/s800/Screen%20shot%202010-05-27%20at%209.11.54%20AM.jpg" /></a><br />Weather forecast for our trip.<br /><br />My <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/03/first-look-laufbursche-huckepack.html">LAUFBURSCHE huckePACK</a> performed as I expected it to perform - excellent. Bushwhacking did nothing to the material, which kept the rain out and the stuff dry inside. Plenty of space for food and gear for a week. Love it.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/tzJSX3af88WByElVHk8orA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_KJLi-x_8Zns/TAYb9ko56AI/AAAAAAAAEgA/u3rnbrFtsKs/s800/P1020499.JPG" /></a><br />Photo courtesy of Joe Newton / <a href="http://thunderinthenight.blogspot.com/">Thunder In The Night</a><br /><br />My <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2009/09/gear-talk-golite-ultra-20-initial.html">GoLite Ultra 20 quilt</a> kept me warm and comfy at night, and as it got slightly moist it was easily dried at the campfire. For summer tours I will stay with quilts, no doubt.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2009/12/gear-talk-sleeping-pads-mattresses.html">Sleeping mats</a>: Mulitmat Adventure & six segments of a Therm-A-Rest Z Lite made for very comfy nights. They function also as a frame and backpanel for my pack, so serve double duty. I can't forget them thus and they also can't break.<br /><br />Shelter: I continue to use the Gossamer Gear SpinnTwinn and really like it. Easy to set up and to fine-tune, plenty of space and great protection from wind and rain. I'd feel comfortable to pitch this on the fjell on a rainy and windy night if need to. Review forthcoming.<br /><br />Bivy: A LAUFBURSCHE tyvek bivy is my bivy of choice. Tyvek is super breathable and under a tarp I don't need much more protection from wind and water. Review forthcoming.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/A6FjjygE7GAGgumniSLeVOEQ03jDDmZnzakDs5ohGsQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TBN7TlMeusI/AAAAAAAACx8/v2_UXWmySXI/s800/_MG_7382.jpg" /></a><br />Camp Night 1.<br /><br />Shell clothing: No surprises here, I continue to use the <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2009/11/gear-talk-rab-momentum-jacket-drillium.html">Rab Momentum jacket and Drillium pants</a> and think they're ace. Dry and protected from wind while walking up hills is all I need. And they dry quick after fording as well.<br /><br />Base layer: Also no surprise, <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/02/gear-talk-woolpower-merino-awesomeness.html">Woolpower long johns and longsleeve</a> keep reigning supreme. Kept me warm in the wind and at night, without smelling. The socks also were excellent, great cushioning and warm feet, even when fording ice cold rivers.<br /><br />Shoes: <a href="http://inov-8.com/Products-Detail.asp?PG=PG1&L=26&P=5050973020">Inov-8 Mudclaw 330</a> were the shoes I used on this trip, and they were great for the conditions we experienced. Great grip in the mud, rock, forest path and riverbeds, though on overflooded duckboards they were a tad slippery. Maybe I like the sole of the <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/03/first-look-inov-8-roclite-295.html">Roclites</a> a bit more. Review forthcoming.<br /><br />Camp & Sleeping wear: Because I knew it was going to be wet I took the <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/03/first-look-montane-fireball-smock.html">Montane Fireball Smock</a> to wear it in camp around the fire, and I continue to like heaps. It is light and takes minimal space in my pack, and has no problems with the rain & wetness we were constantly in. To bed I wore the <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2009/10/first-look-klattermusen-loke.html">Klättermusen Loke</a>, as downy goodness from Sweden with a hood is what lets me sleep tight at night. Really like this garment, review forthcoming.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/5TwVgH7A8BCElK7DhCE_ruEQ03jDDmZnzakDs5ohGsQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TAUrBKaesTI/AAAAAAAACqY/e6PVi7HiAvY/s800/IMG_7188.jpg" /></a><br />First lunch break.<br /><br />Kitchen-wise there were the usual suspects: <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2009/05/gear-test-bushbuddy-ultra-tibetian.html">BushBuddy Ultra and Tibetan Titanium 1100</a> were used for cooking, and now my fire-making skills are so far that I also feel comfortable to use it in the wet conditions we had. LMF Firesteel, puukko, kuksa and a LMF Spork were used for eating, cutting and drinking, and I continue to find them excellent.<br /><br />Food wise I had an assortment of <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/03/trail-food-cereal-and-chocolate-bars.html">cereal and chocolate bars</a> for quick energy on the trail with me, corn spaghetti & chili tomato sauce as well as polenta for lunch and Real Turmats for dinner. Dessert was a finnish organic blueberry "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kissel">kissel</a>" and the obligatory Minttu cacao. Real reigns supreme in the ready-made sector, while the corn spaghetti and chili tomato sauce was ace. I had a Spanish chorizo sausage with me for that high-energy fat, which was delicious.<br /><br />All other small stuff - first aid, gloves, buffs, mitts, socks, platypus, compass et al worked without problems and I will review a couple of the items when I find the time. To conclude, I felt warm, save and well-fed the whole trip despite the rain. With 1863 g for the big three (Rucksack, shelter, sleeping system) I was the lightest of us six, and including food for three full days I started with 6547 g on my back. I see no need to carry more than that, and think it could even be pushed lower if I would switch some items. <br /><br /><a href="http://flattr.com/thing/985/Hiking-in-Finland-Ultralight-Backpacking-Blog" target="_blank"><img src="http://api.flattr.com/button/button-compact-static-100x17.png" title="Flattr this" border="0" /></a></div>
