<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">I'm off to walk from Kuru to the Helvetinj√§rvi National park and then to Ruovesi, approximately 50 km for two and half days. Two nights out in the nature, giving the <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/2009/08/gear-talk-tarptent-scarp-1-initial.html">Scarp 1</a> its initial test. I included my packing list underneath in this post, as well as all the gear laid out before packing. Its supposed to be raining on Sunday, so James might get the desired test report in real world conditions!<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&current=Packing_list_2108-2308.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/Packing_list_2108-2308.png" border="0" alt="Packing list"></a><br />The packing list. Made in Numbers on a Mac, from a modified template made by <a href="http://www.theotherface.wordpress.com/">The Other Face</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&current=DSCN0235.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/DSCN0235.jpg" border="0" alt="Gear"></a><br />Gear laid out.<br /><br />You might be wondering why I take two mats with me. Well, I use the Prolite 4 as a frame in my <a href="http://hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/2009/07/ula-ohm-arrived.html">Ohm</a>, and will give my small NeoAir its first outing. I plan to replace the Prolite 4 with a Z-lite as a frame soon. All in all its a bit heavy still, but there's a 2 kg camera in there as well, which is the first time I take it. I'll be replacing some gear and clothes in the near future, so I expect it to get lighter. Your input and suggestions are welcome, and I am looking forward to your comments over the weekend!<br /><br /></span></div>
