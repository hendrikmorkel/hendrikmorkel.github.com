Dear Santa,

I'm not getting younger, and hence sleeping on the ground gets harder and harder. Until it hit me [the other day](http://hikinginfinland.com/2012/01/the-ultimate-hang-ultralight-backpackin-tips.html): A Hammock is the solution! If you start looking into hammocks, one name keeps poping up: [Warbonnet Outdoors](http://warbonnetoutdoors.com/), purveyors of the best hammocks made. The [Blackbird](http://warbonnetoutdoors.com/blackbirds.php), [Ridgerunner](http://warbonnetoutdoors.com/ridgerunner.php) and [Traveler](http://warbonnetoutdoors.com/travelers.php) are their models, and I just yet can not make up my mind, but then I hope I will by the time the day runs out. One thing is for sure: Each of these hammocks are superbly made and will elevate me from the hard ground and make me sleep softly in the air. 

Sincerely yours,


An aspiring lightpacking hammocker
