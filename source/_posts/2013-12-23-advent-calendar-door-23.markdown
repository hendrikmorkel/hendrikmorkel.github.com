Dear Santa,

It's sleeping one more night, and then you come. Sleeping in the outdoors is a much discussed topic, and I find with [Multimat](http://www.multimat.uk.com/)'s sleeping [pads](http://www.multimat.uk.com/store/t/range/pg/foam) and [mattresses](http://www.multimat.uk.com/store/t/range/pg/inflatable) I have the best sleep under the sky. The UK company has just released the [Superlite Air](http://www.multimat.uk.com/store/products/superlite-air), a beautiful red inflatable mat which weighs in at 300 g - and that with an inflated size of 183 x 49 x 7 cm! It packs down to the size of a small plastic bottle and fits thus in your present bag and my ultralight rucksack. Best of all, on this thickly cushioned mattress I can sleep in luxurious comfort under the stars, waiting for your arrival!

Sincerely yours,


An aspiring lightpacker
