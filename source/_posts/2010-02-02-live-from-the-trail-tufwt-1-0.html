Sitting in a warm, beautiful old cottage while my new-won friends are outside ice fishing and snowshoeing. We had a wonderful time hiking, and had temperatures of -4 C till -17 C. Now we enjoy the luxuries of a cottage with a stove and a sauna which we heat up every evening, with a dip in the ice hole as it is tradition in Finland. A full report next weekend, as we have a few more days in this peaceful, perfect spot.<br /><br /><center><a href='http://picasaweb.google.com/Habichtshorst/HendrikM?authkey=Gv1sRgCLvs4Jmc6rPU2wE#5433617825634952178'><img src='http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S2gWn7Yzo_I/AAAAAAAABgk/szH-WU0o0to/s288/iphone_photo.jpg' border='0' width='280' height='281' style='margin:5px'></a></center><br />The inside of the cottage, with view on the frozen lake.<br /><br /><center><a href='http://picasaweb.google.com/Habichtshorst/HendrikM?authkey=Gv1sRgCLvs4Jmc6rPU2wE#5433617904654329506'><img src='http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S2gWshwfpqI/AAAAAAAABgo/Mi_DzxHWh9U/s288/iphone_photo.jpg' border='0' width='280' height='281' style='margin:5px'></a></center><br />The Teerilami cottage.<br /><br />- Posted using BlogPress from my iPhone<br /></div>
