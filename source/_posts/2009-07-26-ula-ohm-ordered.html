I was looking already for a while for a new backpack, and in nearer consideration, besides the Ohm, were the Osprey Exos 46 and 58, the </span><a href="http://www.gossamergear.com/cgi-bin/gossamergear/Mariposa_Plus.html"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">Gossamer Gear Mariposa</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"> and the </span><a href="http://www.zpacks.com/backpacks/blast.shtml"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">Blast 32 from ZPacks</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">.<br /><br />While the Blast 32 would have been the lightest Option, weighing only 260 g with all the extras, I didn't want to wait till December - Joe, the owner of ZPacks, is out hiking and so the Shop is closed. I like the looks and functionality of the Mariposa, but somehow I didn't click with it. I tried on both Exos models, and found them comfortable, but they're heavy, expensive and mainstream.<br /><br />So I decided for the </span><a href="http://www.ula-equipment.com/ohm.asp"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">Ohm</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">. Simple, functional, great looking, and made by a cottage manufacturer in the USA, offered for a unbeatable price of $130. With a base weight of 595 g it was also the lightest pack (after the Blast), and after careful study of the threads on </span><a href="http://www.backpackinglight.com/cgi-bin/backpackinglight/forums/thread_display.html?forum_thread_id=8302"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">backpackinglight.com</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"> I decided on a Size L with a Medium hipbelt. The order was placed last Friday, and lo and behold, the backpack was shipped that same Friday! That's what I call customer service. So now I spent the days waiting, and hope that my new backpack will arrive as quick as James' so that I can take it out for a hike next weekend! Hopefully also my new tent will be here by then...</span><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;"><br /></span><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;"> </span></div></div>
