It was a busy week yet again. Besides all the "<a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/06/back-from-valadalen.html">Back from Vålådalen</a>" posts there is a flood of TGO reports. Lets go.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/ekV4lKsfouYLVTHgUZagWuEQ03jDDmZnzakDs5ohGsQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TAUq7SQku8I/AAAAAAAACqM/oG8tWZT_7z0/s800/IMG_7176.jpg" /></a><br /><br />There was only one TGOC article I read thus far, and that was Andy Howell's excellent "<a href="http://www.andyhowell.info/trek-blog/2010/05/30/a-younger-challenge-not-only-a-more-vibrant-event-but-one-with-a-bright-future/">A Younger Challenge: Not Only a More Vibrant Event But One With a Bright Future</a>". Its a great piece and makes me want to send in an application for next years challenge.<br /><br />Hana is fit again and was taken out on a trip up <a href="http://hana2009.wordpress.com/2010/06/04/ogawayama-小川山-kokushidake-国師ヶ岳/">Ogawayama and Kokushidake</a>. Makes me want a four legged companion for my trips.<br /><br />Comet passed the 300 mile marker on his PCT hike, <a href="http://www.iamthechan.com/2010/06/03/what-was-i-thinking/">and asks himself what he was thinking</a>.<br /><br />Snakeball on the other hand is already a bit further ahead and is walking through the <a href="http://freiwildontour.blogspot.com/2010/05/mojave-desert.html">Mojave Desert</a> and wonders if he needs to change his perception of a desert.<br /><br />Fraser went on a bicycle trip in <a href="http://mcalisterium.wordpress.com/2010/06/05/glen-derry-by-bike/">Glen Derry</a> and if you follow Fraser already you know he shots cracking photos. He pushes the envelope in this report once more.<br /><br />While Don Meredith did not get to go on a bike trip because of the weather, his <a href="http://lightpack.blogspot.com/2010/05/shortest-bikepacking-trip-on-record.html">packing list looked pretty awesome</a> - Fraser could still learn a thing or two there ;)<br /><br />Jonas went <a href="http://blog.nature-base.de/2010/06/02/bouldern-in-norddeutschland/">bouldering in the forests of Northern Germany</a>. Nice green forests and blue skies - when it doesn't rain!<br /><br />Richard went on a day trip on the <a href="http://maceachain.blogspot.com/2010/06/north-antrim-causeway-coast.html">North Antrim Causeway Coast</a> and brought back stunning photos. <br /><br />Roman Dial reports briefly of his <a href="http://packrafting.blogspot.com/2010/06/skurka-week.html">week with Andrew Skurka and Mike Brown</a>.<br /><br />Sam went on a short trip to the <a href="http://ultralightbackpacking.blogspot.com/2010/06/east-fork-sage-creek-absaroka-beartooth.html">East Fork Sage Creek - Absaroka Beartooth Wilderness</a>, exploring caves, making fires and enjoying whisky with conversation. Seems trail happiness is universal.<br /><br />Die Beuteltiere went on a weekend trip from the <a href="http://www.beuteltiere.org/2010/06/von-der-waldeifel-ins-ahrtal.html">Waldeifel to the Ahrtal</a> (Ahr valley), and besides a Dyneema huckePACK there where plenty of encounters with the animals of the region and historical sights.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.andyhowell.info/trek-blog/2010/06/06/back-from-the-arizona-trail/">Colin Ibbotson is back from the Arizona trail</a> and while he takes some time to get back into "real life" you can listen to his thoughts on the trail and check out the photos.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/HfgzgZKsEX2vcOmySkbCgeEQ03jDDmZnzakDs5ohGsQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TAUqzx7uh-I/AAAAAAAACpw/cSj7tycPBMI/s800/_MG_7509.jpg" /></a><br />A groovy biotic muffin, made by <a href="http://thunderinthenight.blogspot.com/">Joe</a>.<br /><br />In the gear review section I really enjoyed Robin's "<a href="http://blogpackinglight.wordpress.com/2010/05/31/lessons-learnt/">lessons learnt</a>" post where he goes briefly through the various gear he took out on his latest trip.<br /><br />If you, like me, carry a DSLR into the outdoors, and if you're not as lucky with the weather, you might need something to protect your expensive camera and lenses. <a href="http://www.0817.de/2010/einweg-regenschutz-fur-die-slr-kamera/">Here I found</a> an interesting solution which I am planning to try out in the future.<br /><br />Phil has a look at the <a href="http://phil-turner.net/?p=1042">Brasher Neon shoes</a>, which look like a steal for 25£.<br /><br />Looking for a lightweight raft for white water action? Here's a <a href="http://packrafting.blogspot.com/2010/05/alpacka-witchcraft_30.html">first look at the Alpacka WitchCraft</a>.<br /><br />PCT has a look at some sweet merino garments from Chocolate Fish, namely the<a href="http://www.petesy.co.uk/chocolate-fish-taranaki-t-shirt-fly-front-boxers-and-bunnet/"> Taranaki T-Shirt, Fly-Front Boxers and Bunnet</a>. Nice colours and made in the UK, I like that.<br /><br /><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/MhIy7xzjaPw&hl=en_US&fs=1&color1=0x234900&color2=0x4e9e00"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/MhIy7xzjaPw&hl=en_US&fs=1&color1=0x234900&color2=0x4e9e00" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object><br /><br />Four Dog Stove made some ace looking videos, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/fourdogstoveco">check them all out here</a> or click play on the video above.<br /><br />I reckon you have heard about this <span style="font-style:italic;">tiny</span> problem BP has, and therefore I do think you should <a href="http://www.hikingtripreports.com/2010/05/26/boycott-bp/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+HikingTripReports+%28Hiking+Trip+Reports%29&utm_content=Google+Reader">boycott BP</a> if you drive a car. <br /><br />Finally, there is the Outdoor fair coming up in Germany soon-ish. I was asked by a few people if I'd come and would join them, but I decided that I rather not go. I hate huge amounts of people, and as I reckon that <a href="http://lighthiker.wordpress.com/">Roman</a> and <a href="http://hrxxlight.com/">Benjamin</a> will do a good job of covering the happening from an UL perspective and I am not up for a race of "Who posts what first" I'll rather relax in Finland.</div>
