<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"><a href="http://www.mammut.ch/">Mammut</a> has currently a </span><a href="http://basecamp.mammut.ch/en/homepage"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">Geocache Challenge</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"> going on, which will finish some time in September, so there is still plenty of time to participate. There's prices to win as well, for both the people searching and the people hiding the Caches - the first prize is Mammut equipment from head to foot, worth a total of 3,000 Swiss francs and a weekend in the mountains with Mammut top mountaineer Stephan Siegrist. I just yesterday hid my first Geochache here in Tampere and it should soon be seen on the Mammut website.<br /><br /></span><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_0706.jpg" target="_blank"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/IMG_0706.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket" /></span></a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"><br />Me and the Geocache.<br /><br />If you got no idea what Geocaching is: Geocaching is a kind of modern-day treasure hunt. Someone hides a container, called the cache, in a location which can then be found by anyone else using precise coordinates. This was the first of three Caches I will be hiding, the next two should be soon hidden all around the country.<br /><br />I think its a great campaign, as it motivates people to go out, and also motivates people who find a Cache by accident to participate. And its an extraordinarily good marketing campaign too.</span></div>
