Dear Santa,

I'm returning time and again to alcohol stoves for cooking on the trail. They are lightweight, efficient, silent and clean. After I've started to walk down the ultralight path, my Trangia has become a bit too heavy and big, and my research shows that the [Keg-F](http://www.traildesigns.com/stoves/caldera-keg-f-stove-system) from [Trail Designs](http://www.traildesigns.com) is the lightest, most stable, wind resistant, and efficient cooking system you can get. For example, the weight of the Pot, Cone & Stove is a mere 77 gram - an Ultralighters dream! I'd be delighted if you would bring me a Keg-F these holidays, so that I no longer need to cook with my heavy Trangia.

Have a great start into the new week, 



*An aspiring UL Backpacker*
