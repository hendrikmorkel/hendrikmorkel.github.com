Dear Santa,

Smartphones are wonderful. While one shouldn't rely on them for navigation, they can assist with finding the right street out of the town to the trail, and snap photos and share them with friends and family while out hiking. Things get a bit more complicated if it is raining and snowing, though thanks to some [splendid research](http://hikinginfinland.com/2012/04/how-to-keep-your-gadgets-dry.html) I now know how to keep my smartphone dry: With a [SealLine E-Case](http://cascadedesigns.com/en/sealline/e-cases/category)! The [eSeries 8 Case](http://cascadedesigns.com/en/sealline/e-cases/eseries/eseries-8/product) would be perfect for my phone, and either green or orange would be my prefered colour choices. 

Dry gadgets on happy trails,


*An aspiring UL Backpacker*
