<span style="font-style:italic;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">"Another Vest?"</span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"> you ask? Yes! This time from a small manufacturer from Romania, </span><a href="http://www.montangrup.ro/index_engleza.html"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">Nahanny</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">, who is more known in mountaineering circles for producing top class equipment which will keep you warm, dry and safe under the direst of conditions. I got a Down Vest from them, which is mightily warm and comfortable. It has two draw cords at the bottom, which will hinder the cold from creeping up. Two hand pockets, which are easy to open with one hand, and a double inside pocket to keep those batteries for the camera warm offer plenty of storage area.<br /><br /></span><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FQ44ZeNIoL2O_QVYFdazqA?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&amp;feat=embedwebsite"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/SrZ1VsPMaaI/AAAAAAAAAeE/XFpUTNG6Jiw/s800/_MG_1855.JPG" /></span></a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"><br /><br />What else does it offer? Well, how about 270 g of down? Yes, that's a lot of down, and it will keep me warm till -10°C easily. Some fear that they can't keep their down dry from rain. That's less of a problem with the Nahanny Down Vest, as it has a 7000 mm water resistant outer, which should keep the warm down dry. The reinforced shoulders allow me to wear the vest also with a backpack on, and the protective flap at the top keeps the zipper from coming into my beard =) The reflective line at the top is nice for when I'm walking on roads in the mornings or evening, as it improves safety.<br /><br /></span><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/9MEZhptGbB9ietL6wng31g?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&amp;feat=embedwebsite"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/SrZ1dGc4LaI/AAAAAAAAAeI/P9GJ9Dq9seU/s800/IMG_1881.JPG" /></span></a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"><br /><br />What I really like about the vest is the colour - black (the one on their website in orange certainly would be something for </span><a href="http://www.petesy.co.uk/"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">PTC*</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">)! The guys at Nahanny are quite flexible when it comes to special wishes, and as I am writing about lightweight gear they went out of their way to make the vest as light as possible - it clocked in at 480 g on my scale, which I find an excellent warmth to weight ratio. After all, autumn is in full swing and its just a matter of time that the first frost will arrive, and winter will be quick on its heels. Then I'll be happy to don my Down Vest in the evenings at the fireside, or just for a walk to the supermarket to fetch some groceries. The Down Vest is priced at a very reasonable 80€, considering its hand made and every piece is unique a cheap price. To get one, you should visit the </span><a href="http://www.montangrup.ro/index_engleza.html"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">Nahanny webshop</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">. Make sure to let them know your preferred colour!<br /><br /><br /></span><a href="http://technorati.com/faves?sub=addfavbtn&amp;add=http://www.hikinginfinland.blogspot.com"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"><img src="http://static.technorati.com/pix/fave/tech-fav-1.png" alt="Add to Technorati Favorites" /></span></a></div>
