<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"><a href="http://hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/2009/10/gear-talk-camp-hygiene.html">Yesterday</a> I wrote how convenient I find the <a href="http://cascadedesigns.com/msr/camp-towels/ct-accessories/packsoap/product">MSR Packsoap</a>, and today I'm giving away three bottles of them! All you need to do is leave a comment with your name and email address (<span style="font-style:italic;">if you want - see the edit below</span>) until next week Friday, 16th of October. I will then randomly pick three lucky winners, whom I will send the soap bottle, so that they can stay clean on their backpacking trips! This contest is made possible by <a href="http://cascadedesigns.com/MSR">MSR</a>, who provided me the three Packsoaps. I send anywhere on this planet, Japan, Australia, UK, USA - so take a chance!<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/O7vBi_ooegH1Kby2yO-qBw?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/Ss3N24JBE9I/AAAAAAAAAos/VBsBBYynkq8/s800/IMG_2840.JPG" /></a><br />Three Packsoaps, looking for a new home.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">/edit:</span> If you don't want to give your name or email address for fearing Spam, it is OK as well, just leave a comment and I will announce the winners afterwards, and then you can contact me via Email. Thanks for <a href="http://i-cjw.com/">Chris</a> to bring that to my attention.<br /><br /><a href="http://technorati.com/faves?sub=addfavbtn&amp;add=http://www.hikinginfinland.blogspot.com"><img src="http://static.technorati.com/pix/fave/tech-fav-1.png" alt="Add to Technorati Favorites" /></a></span></div>
