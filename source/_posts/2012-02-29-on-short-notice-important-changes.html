It is time to say Good Bye, Dear Google Friend Connect Followers. <br /><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/VhArY8sMAULb933pyncp7jWiupv70N-RGKSfyQFBX78?feat=embedwebsite"><img height="392" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-KuZnk8j55kk/T036K6KAF4I/AAAAAAAAGK4/H8Ug-RdBqkc/s800/Screen%2520Shot%25202012-02-29%2520at%252012.12.11%2520PM.jpg" width="800" /></a><br /><br />Tomorrow, on the 1st of March, you will depart from here<b>*</b>, as Google didn't find you worthy enough <s>and wants you to use Google+</s>. You lose the possibility to stay connected and show your support, I lose <s>my digital ego boost</s> a way to find new, interesting blogs and see who is reading HIF. <br /><br />But fear not, you have a few options to continue to receive your fix of high-quality Hiking in Finland content - from trip reports to gear reviews, interviews with cottage gear makers, Ultralight A-Z and the UL Podcast, this is something you don't want to miss. Here's the Emergency Rescue Plan™ to ensure your survival without Google Friend Connect:<br /><ol><li><a href="http://eepurl.com/jCWIX" target="_blank">Subscribe to the Hiking in Finland Newsletter</a>. Subscribing to the Email Newsletter means you will receive not more than once a week (more likely once a month) an Email with more personal content and updates. Imagine something á la <i>The Week In Review</i>, directly to your Inbox, hand-picked with the best of the best of what's going on.</li><li><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/hikinginfinland/HApk" target="_blank">Subscribe to the HIF RSS Feed</a>. Subscribing via RSS means you get each article in full to your RSS Reader of choice, right after it is published (I suggest <a href="http://reederapp.com/" target="_blank">Reeder App</a>).</li><li>Handpick what you want to see/ hear/ read from me on the following services: <a href="https://vimeo.com/hendrikmorkel/" target="_blank">Vimeo</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/hendrikmorkel" target="_blank">Twitter</a> | <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Habichtshorst" target="_blank">Youtube</a> | <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/105082905705272949032/105082905705272949032/posts" target="_blank">Google+</a> | <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Nordic-Lightpacking/128701720487438" target="_blank">Facebook</a> | <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/" target="_blank">Flickr</a></li></ol>All those are not mutually exclusive. You can sign up to the HIF Newsletter, subscribe to the RSS Feed, and follow me on any of the services. There might be some overlap, but I try to keep it minimal. I hope you continue to enjoy reading Hiking in Finland, and if you have questions or comments, please do not hesitate to contact me - you can reach me at <a href="mailto:hendrik@hikinginfinland.com?subject=Hiking%20in%20Finland%20-%20Question!">hendrik@hikinginfinland.com</a> - or leave a comment underneath.<br /><br />---<br /><br /><b>*</b><i>I'll deactivate the Google Friend Connect tool tomorrow as well. With the upcoming move away from Blogger there's no sense in keeping it there; and there's a host of possibilities now to stay in touch.</i><br /><br /><b>Update</b>: Fellow outdoor bloggers on Blogger - as far as I understand, GFC for Blogger blogs seems to live on; the question obviously is for how long. Google is well known for dropping services for which they don't care anymore, and might want to have you use G+ in the end, so be aware.</div>
