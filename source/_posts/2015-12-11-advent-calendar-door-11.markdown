Dear Santa,

70 meters can be short - or long if we're talking about a Pitch on the Cassin. That you don't want to go with a short rope climbing is clear, so the [70 m Beal Zonsi 10.1 Single Rope in the Bergfreunde Edition](http://www.bergfreunde.de/beal-zonsi-101-bergfreunde-edition-einfachseil/) is a much better choice - be it for climbing the project at the home crag, train lead climbing at the gym or visit Turkey for some fine limestone climbing. At 10.1 mm diameter it can take a lot of abuse, and the weight of 63 g/ m is very reasonable for such a durable rope. The great handling and compatibility with most belay device is just another plus point for this long rope, and with 70 meters of rope you can climb Kantti at Olhava top to bottom!
