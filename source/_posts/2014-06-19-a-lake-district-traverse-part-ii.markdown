As it's almost a month ago that I published [Part I](http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/05/a-lake-district-traverse.html) of my Lakeland Traverse and there have been several more trips since then, it's time to hike on and bring it to a finish =)

After a calm night I wake up, have breakfast and smile because the sun is shining as I head up towards Sca Fell.

I continue to smile, even as it gets more and more cloudy the nearer I get to the summit.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14100737371" title="Sca Fell in the mist by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7209/14100737371_aca59cc552_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Sca Fell in the mist"></a>

Once there, the summit is indeed dressed in clouds as, accompanied with a stiff breeze. Hardshell top and bottom come on, down I go.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14464228632" title="Foxes Tarn by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3851/14464228632_af387f9179_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Foxes Tarn"></a>

The descent to Foxes Tarn is nice though you should be sure-footed. The place itself looked clean and inviting for a camp, but I continued.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14464435354" title="Whaddyalookingat? by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2926/14464435354_ebe953770b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Whaddyalookingat?"></a>

Down a scrambly bit to the path up Scafell Pike. Good fun that section! Up on England's highest hill I snap a Selfie and walk on. Views are good, people few.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14442477696" title="Scafell Pike by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5564/14442477696_133ca1fd87_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Scafell Pike"></a>

But it are the views from Bowfell that I enjoy most.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14278945979" title="Sca Fell &amp; Scafell Pike by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2921/14278945979_f9aeefc6de_b.jpg" width="680" height="1024" alt="Sca Fell &amp; Scafell Pike"></a>

I descend via the Flat Slabs and head onwards to the Old Dungeon Ghyll Climber's Bar.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14465578885" title="Flat Slabs by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3885/14465578885_812eb60118_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Flat Slabs"></a>

A fine Ale, soup and a roll are consumed, and with not much enthusiasm I leave the fine establishment behind. My route takes me up to Stickle Tarn, where I count four other tents around the lake!

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14485734013" title="Stickle Tarn by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3884/14485734013_8bbd3a8927_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Stickle Tarn"></a>

It's windy and I'm soon in my quilt after a hot meal. It is a fiercely windy night and past midnight a couple descends to the valley past me under my TrailStar. Rain sets in occasionally. I drift in and out of sleep, and with dawn I'm up. The Coleman gas canister is empty (after just 3 l of water boiled!) and so I can't have my morning coffee. Up I go, forgoing the scramble I came for.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14378696112" title="Above Stickle Tarn by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5040/14378696112_6157530f5f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Above Stickle Tarn"></a>

Drizzle and wind accompany me on my way to High Raise and onwards to Calf Crag, Gibson Knott and Helm Crag, before I descend to the village of Grasmere.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14193578570" title="Cloudy by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2938/14193578570_7f313cd441_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Cloudy"></a>

I buy a new gas canister and fruits, have a coffee and soup and head up Grisedale Tarn. The weather improves and the sun breaks through.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14465582995" title="Arriba by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5474/14465582995_f52759df3a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Arriba"></a>

My plan to go on to Helvellyn and walk its Ridges is dropped in favour of a low camp. But the valleys are private land and I don't feel like sneaking into one of the woods to pitch my TrailStar and so end up in the Youth Hostel in Patterdale. A hot shower is enjoyed, and a good sleep is had.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14193489749" title="Looking up to Grisedale by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2939/14193489749_047e97d4e0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Looking up to Grisedale"></a>

Breakfast on the sofa, packing with plenty of space, wall to wall sunshine awaiting me. 

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/13948223152" title="That way by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2938/13948223152_b31fb818c2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="That way"></a>

Up to Angletarn Pikes. A lovely hill with fine views all the way.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/13948221232" title="Upwards by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7121/13948221232_2b2bbe2598_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Upwards"></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14380144815" title="Lovely view by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2915/14380144815_d36e8bc42c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Lovely view"></a>

Angle Tarn is a wonderful place and would make a fine camping spot. Birds are swimming on its clear blue water, while the sun reflects in ripples as a slight breeze sweeps across it.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14193530658" title="Angle Tarn by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3856/14193530658_46c3c33068_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Angle Tarn"></a>

The views from up here are magnificent, further enhenced by the superb weather. I walk with an open wind jacket and cuffs up, but soon decide it's time to hike in my T-Shirt.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14193699467" title="Gate by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3837/14193699467_022eb5b942_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Gate"></a>

I take the faint path up Rest Dodd before heading down and up to The Knott. Time for coffee and Vitamin C in the sun, there's no hurry anywhere.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14379174464" title="Coffee on The Knott by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2902/14379174464_06571c2c53_b.jpg" width="680" height="1024" alt="Coffee on The Knott"></a>

I stroll onwards to the High Street where plenty of day hikers enjoy the great weather. I shortly ponder a stroll up and down the Riggindale Crag, but decide to head onwards to the Thornthwaite Crag. A large cairn marker (more a tower, really) spends shade that is welcomed in this hot weather.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14193497129" title="Blue by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5231/14193497129_9eeb9496af_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Blue"></a>

The impending ridge walk of Froswick, Ill Bell and Yoke has me smiling ear to ear.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14379175414" title="Spikey by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5191/14379175414_3f63597556_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Spikey"></a>

Then water runs low and so I am looking out for water. Close to the Garburn Pass I find a gurgling stream and the Playtypuses are filled up and emptied right away. Tasty. So why not stay?

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14380141145" title="Camp III by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2928/14380141145_b69ab58d1c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Camp III"></a>

I do. It's beautiful and I love the views - Windermere to the south, the high hills to the west, crags, grass and sheep to the north and east. I have a mighty fine evening up on the hill, and fall asleep under the stars.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/13912268942" title="MLD TrailStar in the English Lake District. by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2900/13912268942_8066e0cef6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="MLD TrailStar in the English Lake District."></a>

The next morning the weather is again on repeat: Blue sky and sunshine. I take it slow, enjoy the last bit outside, but am soon enough on the trail. 

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14380137475" title="Troutbeck Tongue by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3918/14380137475_5f5a6dc457_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Troutbeck Tongue"></a>

Then I arrive at Orrest Head, Tourists being delighted by the view to be had from here. And also I smile, even as know that this will be the last time I will lay my eyes on the hills of the Lake District, those fine small mountains whom I just traversed. And so I walk down to the railway station, happy to return in the future.
