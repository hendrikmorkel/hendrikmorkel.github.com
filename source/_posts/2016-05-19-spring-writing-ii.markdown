## WALDEN

[WALDEN](http://www.walden-magazin.de) is a new German magazine which not only has a fantastic layout & design, the content and stories in it also are top-notch. Thus it was a nice surprise to be asked if I'd like to contribute a short piece to the third issue - and now I'm part of the WALDEN family. Read my and other outdoor blogger's spring tips in issue three which you can [order here](http://shop.geo.de/einzelhefte/walden/walden-01-2016.html).

## Outdoor Enthusiast 

I already mentioned my online piece about [Via Ferratas](http://www.oe-mag.co.uk/imag/oemarchapril2016/files/36.html) in the Outdoor Enthusiast Magazine a month or two ago, but the article is also in the print magazine. It's free and includes some great stories & photos, so if you see it in your local outdoor shop grab a copy and enjoy it with a glass of beer the next time you're needing an outdoor fix!

## Bike & Travel and trekking Magazin

For both the [Bike & Travel Magazine](http://www.biketravel-magazin.com) and [trekking Magazin](http://www.trekkingmagazin.com) I have been writing a company portrait of Thule, the Swedish company that's well-known for their innovative transport solutions for bikes & skis. Both pieces are slightly different, so if you want to know more about Thule's backpack line make sure to grab a copy of the trekking Magazin while if you're a cyclist and want to know about their panniers and child transporters grab the Bike & Travel Magazin!
