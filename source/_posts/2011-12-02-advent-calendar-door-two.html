I found out that <a href="http://oookworks.com/"target="_blank">OookWorks</a> makes an ace cuben fibre pack sack called the CrispPackets (I wonder if crisps are included in it?) which could solve this dilemma. I could fit all my dinky small items in there, so that they're no longer flying loosely around in my pack, or stuff my downjacket in it and be sure that it stays dry. Its mighty light, too - maybe you want to consider a cuben sack instead of your jute bag to carry the present? I'd love to get one, and hope that you will think of me.<br /><br />Best,<br /><br /><br /><i>- An aspiring UL-Backpacker</i><br /><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/-IM1JNdfn7uJVuYSPrRvG2iBcik-iSu3FtqWq-IAnas?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-YzoXy06U9j0/TteUVzEuEpI/AAAAAAAAFnc/7FhXQeg-YwU/s800/oookworks.jpg" height="500" width="500" /></a><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/0PQD0ikUOlJwxOgteZkE_WiBcik-iSu3FtqWq-IAnas?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-tgoYyDMyu4k/TtelkqtMs1I/AAAAAAAAFnw/idtloF5OKjg/s640/P1040608.JPG" height="360" width="640" /></a><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/tqCjdYfAjuFhIZ1yxZOQ92iBcik-iSu3FtqWq-IAnas?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/--7ldTM8ENXA/TtellsI65QI/AAAAAAAAFn0/2o16gaZGaCc/s640/P1040609.JPG" height="360" width="640" /></a><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Z-7WoSljolGaFPKoLPVpZGiBcik-iSu3FtqWq-IAnas?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-liy8x0oEOUQ/TtelmWbXssI/AAAAAAAAFn4/FP3nM4oNH2M/s640/P1040610.JPG" height="482" width="640" /></a><br /><br />So, the time frame will be 6 am till 3 pm (15 o'clock) FINNISH time.
