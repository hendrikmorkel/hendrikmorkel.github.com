Dear Santa,

The weather is anything but Christmas-like here. After half a meter of snow in the beginning of December several rainy and warm days later building an igloo has been postponed to the future indefinitely, and instead of down garments [synthetic insulation](http://www.outdoorline.sk/en/32-synthetic-insulation) is king again. Staying warm when wet is a definite advantage of it, and the new [Westcomb Echo Vest](http://www.outdoorline.sk/en/synthetic-insulation/235-westcomb-echo-vest.html) - made from the new Polartec® Alpha® material - also breathes well. So ideal for autumn trailruns in the rain, cross-country skiing in the spring, and ice climbing all winter long. To get this fine Canadian-made garment you'll need to direct your sleigh to [Outdoorline.sk](http://www.outdoorline.sk/), who close to the Tatra Mountains sit in one of Europe's most beautiful countries. And please - if there's snow there - bring some here, too!

Sincerely yours,


An aspiring lightpacker
