UL Jedis wear thick, puffy pullovers and jackets to boost the warmth rating of their quilts, because that's multiple use of items and allows us to go lighter. The <a href="http://www.klattermusen.se/produkt.php?lang=EN&curr=EUR&id=135&modell=Herr&produktGrupp=Varmande&produktKategori=Jacka"target="_blank">Klättermusen Loke</a> is enhancing our warmth force field and allows us to look dangerous and sexy at the same time, and hence is the ideal UL Jedi puffy pullover.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/rVtzqlWC2spw7wAvoqW7i_5weyxkNzNUa0U9odeE-KE?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TM3YPpy2jxI/AAAAAAAADek/uVdEn8BkkbY/s800/Uploaded%20from%20my%20Photo%20Share.png" height="532" width="800" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/dJ29gU6Lpju8rVjDGOhV1P5weyxkNzNUa0U9odeE-KE?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TM3XfnRKVNI/AAAAAAAADeA/k9bsJAJzBBw/s800/Uploaded%20from%20my%20Photo%20Share.png" height="532" width="800" /></a><br />Adventure, danger, safety = ingredients of a UL Jedi's life.<br /><br />A year ago I gave you <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2009/10/first-look-klattermusen-loke.html"target="_blank">a first, teasing look at the Klättermusen Loke</a>. It has seen plenty of action in the forests and hills of Finland, Sweden and Russia since, and thus it is time to shed more light on this garment. *<span style="font-style:italic;">Takes out his scale</span>* 421 g  for my Size S, after cutting off the useless adjusting strings on the hood. Klättermusen says its 370 g in a Medium, as mine is a Prototype model it is possible that they tweaked it a bit further to reduce the weight. Down weight is 95 g of finest 800+ goose down. <br /><br />It has a Boxwall construction without penetrating seams, which means it is warmer than sewn-through garments which get cold spots at the seam. The arms are fairly long and I can hide my hands comfortably in them, and the elastic hem and cuffs keep the warmth in and the cold drafts out. It is made of environmentally friendly, lightweight ripstop nylon and has the shoulders and hood reinforced with stretch polyamide. It also has a good DWR coating (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfluorooctanoic_acid"Target="_blank">PFOA</a> free) which kept the drizzle off, very nice if you just need to go for a quick pee at night and don't want to get dressed with your hardshell.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/dEoLjclM9FGwLQc22hDb2f5weyxkNzNUa0U9odeE-KE?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TM3Z2M22ZvI/AAAAAAAADfQ/JnwgYA0vDwA/s800/Uploaded%20from%20my%20Photo%20Share.png" height="532" width="800" /></a><br />The front can be opened well and allows for good ventilation.<br /><br />So, what is so good about this puffy pullover, you ask? Well, I really, really, like the retro look of it, aka the slanted button front. Yeah yeah, function over style, for sure, but if you get both then that rocks, right? That's the reason not more people wear Dri Ducks, for example ;) Anyway. The hood is excellent, and the front closes nice high which allows you to just peek out with your eyes, the rest is protected from the cold. I like the kangaroo pocket very much, a good place to store gloves, buff, puukko, spoon and other stuff when you need your hands free. It lofts so good, it is unbelievable - even after sweating well into it, after it was left to dry it lofts again as it did on day one. Excellent. It also loses very little down, always a concern with down garments.<br /><br />Bushwhacking, on the few occasions that I did that with this garment, it faired well and took no damage. The Loke packs very small and lofts quickly after unpacking, and has kept me warm in the evenings at the campfire and at night under my quilt. The hood was the main reason for me to get it, as I needed something to keep my head warm at night in my quilt. The Loke's hood does that very well, the fit is perfect and I can close the front fairly small, practical for those cold winter nights. Finally, I of course love that it is made of recycled materials and can be recycled at the end of its life - and you even get money for that! Way to go, I'd say, we need more of such initiatives.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/UYO9d_9kcVNQKLYb31uyaf5weyxkNzNUa0U9odeE-KE?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TM5g2vzINqI/AAAAAAAADf0/8NjnMaaIlaU/s800/Uploaded%20from%20my%20Photo%20Share.png" height="532" width="800" /></a><br />Shoulders and hood have a more durable material, allowing you to wear it while carrying your pack and not damaging it.<br /><br />The Dark Side? Well, for me things can always be lighter and have more down =) Also, that inside store-away pocket is useless and will be removed by me in the future. I just don't use it for anything, and it actually bothers me when sleeping on my belly, so it goes. The elastics on the hood went already, as they bothered me when sleeping as it pushed uncomfortably into my head and their function also was not good.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/ta1ouHMvZnxFe2fFliHvrf5weyxkNzNUa0U9odeE-KE?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TM3Yj0mTSxI/AAAAAAAADew/A8Fy5qqe5bA/s800/Uploaded%20from%20my%20Photo%20Share.png" height="532" width="800" /></a><br />UL Master Jedi uses "The Hooded Stare™". Mind the slanted front button closure.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/8LmaYxD5iHqWEbVhThqz_f5weyxkNzNUa0U9odeE-KE?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TM3YFdx-GSI/AAAAAAAADeY/ICVL0la5dNY/s800/Uploaded%20from%20my%20Photo%20Share.png" height="532" width="800" /></a><br />The pimped hood from behind.<br /><br />Improvements. Well, as you can see from the not-so-good paragraph, get rid of the inside pocket, the hood elastics, and add a bit more down instead (its plenty warm, but more down is always good!). I also imagine that smaller zippers would do the job just as well as the big ones they have now - I rarely use them so you might even consider taking them out completely and putting elastics in instead.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/ZRQGz-HXIAmCP8PAU3jTIv5weyxkNzNUa0U9odeE-KE?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TM3X0KaSU5I/AAAAAAAADeM/ffMwbTA-hTE/s800/Uploaded%20from%20my%20Photo%20Share.png" height="532" width="800" /></a><br />Closer look at the kangaroo pocket zip. Also, Swedes love to put their flag on things, Klättermusen is no different there.<br /><br />Bottom line? At 291€ (includes 25% Swedish VAT!) it isn't cheap. But considering that it is made of top-notch, environmentally friendly materials which are build to last (but can be recycled at the end-of-life!) I think it is worth the money. It packs small, is incredibly warm and looks as good around the campfire as in a hip bar on a Saturday night.
