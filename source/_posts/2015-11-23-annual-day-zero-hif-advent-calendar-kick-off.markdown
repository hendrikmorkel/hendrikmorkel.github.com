Dear Santa,

While I'm Opting to be Outside, sometimes litte things are needed to make them more comfortable. Be that a stove to brew a hot cup of tea or a warm beanie, small things make being outside more fun and pleasurable. The focus, however, is always on being outside, and not the gear. Sure you need it, but it's not the reason to go out. That is to relax, be inspired, spend times with family & good friends and enjoying the beautiful nature.

With that said, some warm down gear does help to make cold winter hikes more fun. Damn, even sitting in a wooden hut is made better with some down around your feet. The [Down Socks](https://goosefeetgear.com/products/1-down-socks) from Goose Feet Gear not only ensure that toes are toasty, they make it possible to dry my trailrunners by the fire so they're ready for next days hike. And if you have cold feet in your quilt - these Down Socks ensure you wake up with warm feet!

Also [The Original Black Rock Gear Down Beanie](https://www.blackrockgear.com/product/test/) is filled with 950 cuin Hungarian Down and ensures a warm head when the wind is blowing in sub-zero temperatures. Hiking with cold ears is so last year, thus a Black Rock Hat is not only keeping the ears warm but also is *trés chic*! Did I mention it is ultralight? Of course it is!

Feet and head being cared for, that leaves the hands as the third extremities which tend to not like to much snow, wind and cold. And it just so happens that the [Mountain Laurel Designs eVent Mitts](http://www.mountainlaureldesigns.com/shop/product_info.php?cPath=37&products_id=51) are not just excellent to keep the rain of my hands, they also work great in winter! Cold wind and snow won't trouble you anymore with these ultralight gloves on your hands.

When you do take the gloves off, it often is to boil water for a hot cup of tea. The [Caldera Sidewinder Solo](https://www.traildesigns.com/stoves/caldera-sidewinder-solo) is not just a very great stove system, with the 1,1 litre pot you can even boil water for your mates so that everyone has a warm cup of tea! It all packs compactly into the pot and is fuel-efficient, thus a great choice for ultralight outdoor enthusiasts.

That leaves a warm coat for those cold temperatures. Or a toasty pair of trousers. Long underwear. Warm winter shoes. Well, sometimes you're missing one piece of gear, and that's where the 50€ Gift Card from [Bergzeit.co.uk](https://www.bergzeit.co.uk/?pid=81/) comes in very useful. With it you can save a nice amount of cash on your next big purchase - be that a Merino Baselayer or your new AT skis, Bergzeit.co.uk has it all.
