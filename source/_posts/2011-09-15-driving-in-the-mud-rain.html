Yesterday I received my new <a href="http://nishiki.com/"target="_blank">bicycle</a>. 29" wheels. 2.5" wide. A Rock Shox fork. Black, white and blue. Yeah, I am excited as little boy with a new toy! Thus the rain didn't hold me back to ride to the <a href="http://tampereenkiipeilykeskus.fi/"target="_blank">climbing gym</a> yesterday, but that didn't really do it justice. Today it continued to rain, but for what do I have <a href="http://www.mtnhaus.com/mount-asgard-smock/"target="_blank">waterproofs</a>, right? <br /><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/7q0HbJI8INrIi9baj9ndig?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ZyIAlJkthGo/TnIxMra0ehI/AAAAAAAAFU4/EqVT-URKsAA/s800/_DSC2424.jpg" height="532" width="800" /></a><br /><br />After some trouble with a website project this morning and afternoon I packed the <a href="http://www.webtogs.co.uk/Jetboil_Sol_Titanium_Premium_Cooking_System_102889.html"target="_blank">JetBoil Sol Ti</a>, some tea & food into the <a href="http://www.ospreypacks.com/en/product/osprey_hydraulics_1/raptor_18"target="_blank">Osprey Raptor 18</a>, filled up the reservoir, put on the waterproofs, gloves and buff and jumped on the bike. <br /><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVqwGgFXMBWulsgxDup7jA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-74NkoTDIlfo/TnIwzNAGQSI/AAAAAAAAFUw/uKALwB946zo/s800/_DSC2422.jpg" height="253" width="800" /></a><br /><br />I headed north through the city, then turned east along the lake till I reached the recreational area forest, where I rode the jogging paths, looking for a nice single track to break her in. As I usually ride a Jopo or my Mom's 50+ years old Holland bike in the city, this is new terrain to me. Very exciting new terrain. <br /><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/AiG3HNALTB19iSWRDP8znA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n1UevJDoC2A/TnIxVULT13I/AAAAAAAAFU8/4ZJG3Qpkkdw/s800/_DSC2425.jpg" height="532" width="800" /></a><br /><br />After a while I got the urge for firing up the JetBoil Sol Ti and have a cup of tea. The Sol Ti worked as expected - brilliantly fast with zero fuss. Less than three minutes to a rolling boil is great in my book. Sipping my Ginger and Lemon tea, I take in the view across the bay. The clouds are blown across the sky, some deep grey, others more of a fluffy white. The sun tries its best through break through the cover, but it just a distant memory - rain and grey dominate. Autumn is here.<br /><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/qyQtvm7fczZQcT0jcVVkJw?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--eyxsoCkj80/TnIxtOwYbDI/AAAAAAAAFVE/isuFx42TFto/s800/_DSC2430.jpg" height="366" width="800" /></a><br /><br />I pack up, put the hoody and gloves back on, and continue over the single track through the forest. Yellow, brown, red and green the leafs make for a spectacular roof above me, while the leafs, roots and rocks on the floor make for a slippery experience - but thanks to those sick wheels, there's no slipping away. Slowly I build up the confidence to ride faster and faster on this terrain. But there's parts where my confidence lacks, and I push. Rocks of football size and roots like planks make me humble.<br /><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/49YFJ5RU3IpXC9l7vO8sAw?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-QohieqCoiXA/TnIxhaTJGNI/AAAAAAAAFVA/Tq7oF6OXiRM/s800/_DSC2426.jpg" height="395" width="800" /></a><br /><br />From the corner of my eye I spot Horns of Plenty, Penny Bums and many more eatable mushrooms. Pulling the breaks, I stand still almost immediately. My hunter-gather instincts want me to take the fruits of the autumn forest home, but for a lack of a small plastic bag they remain where they are. <i>Remember a plastic bag the next time</i>, I think.<br /><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/M3hXIM1Z11E9mqua2mrNDw?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-3rcfGgRx8xg/TnIyPPnEn0I/AAAAAAAAFVM/eCo37r1HCKo/s800/_DSC2432.jpg" height="373" width="800" /></a><br /><br />With the bounty remaining where it is, I continue the ride. The rain decides to show me that it isn't scared by my waterproofs, and commences a deluge. I'm not impressed. Supreme grip under me, I pedal forward until I reach the connecting street. The options are to go south & then west and head home through civilization, or return the same way through the forest. The decision is quickly made - I prefer mud over asphalt. <br /><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/5psoHszt2s5HNgOcnSe1TQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-VrXqg8FlUMU/TnIztduxGqI/AAAAAAAAFVw/j5OLLNhTn3w/s800/_DSC2445.jpg" height="416" width="800" /></a><br /><br />More rain. More mud. More colourful leafs flashing by my eyes, as I ride through the forest. Life is good. Forgotten the stress of the morning. I'm now here, outdoors, in the rain. Wet, sweaty, happy.<br /><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Q0yf8pAmNJzQe4bCklP_WQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-tvZ9HXaxu_4/TnIzc8Xj27I/AAAAAAAAFVo/JdtW2Xep1I4/s800/_DSC2441.jpg" height="238" width="800" /></a><br /><br />Too soon I reach the road along the lake back home. Cars zip by, their red tail lights looking foggy in this weather. Everyone is in a hurry to get somewhere. I lounge, observe, feel the rain hitting my hood, raindrops running along the brim of it. I switch on the <a href="https://www.knog.com.au/gear-lights/boomer-rechargeable.phps"target="_blank">Knog Boomer</a>, so the hasty drivers don't overlook me. I slowly ride on the asphalt, along the lake, down the hill, home. Sauna, I really deserve you tonight.<br /><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/D9MBM0bA16VFoFeZgNbbVg?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-xpxLQrp6WPM/TnIz-H_pjlI/AAAAAAAAFV4/p_KTwb-pp0Q/s800/_DSC2455.jpg" height="373" width="800" /></a><br /><br />The doors to new adventures are wide open.<br /><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/okyv5nHb4_s683vIJxJDaQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ZIopm1DLdCo/TnI05M99rSI/AAAAAAAAFWI/b0pSTkxZN9I/s800/_DSC2469.jpg" height="339" width="800" /></a></div>
