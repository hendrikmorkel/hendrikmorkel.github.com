I had a lot of fun writing for the second trekking Magazin issue of 2015. It included getting a lot of outdoor garments dirty and then learning about how to make them clean and functional again with the help of a bunch of outdoor detergents. Then I had fun taking photos for my hoody round-up and reviewing six hoodies, which should allow anyone who doesn’t have a hoody yet to find one for his needs! And finally I penned a story about my [Polish Tatra](http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/tatra-mountains/) trip which you already could read about on these digital pages in the past. As usually that’s not all: My colleagues went out sleeping in *Biwakschachteln* (bivouac booths) in the Alps, while others went went exploring the Swiss Engadin and hike to an volcano that was erupting. A lot of really inspiring trip reports which certainly will get out in the mood for spring hikes!
