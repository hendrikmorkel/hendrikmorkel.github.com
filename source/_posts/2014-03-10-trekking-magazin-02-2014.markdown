It's spring everywhere, with temperatures of 22Â°C in Germany and even in Vaasa the thermometer stays positive and the sun is out. Birds are singing, the sun is shining - yes, it's spring. And that's also the topic of the newest issue of the trekking Magazin. On 100 pages the spring hiking & trekking season is celebrated, and trip reports from Oman, Denmark, the Zillertal and Spain get you into spring mood.

In my gear column I shed light on the mysteries of softshells & when they make sense, and do quick reviews of the [Outdoor Research Enchainment Jacket](http://bit.ly/1fiPblo), [Mountain Equipment Trojan](http://www.bergzeit.de/mountain-equipment-trojan-hooded-jacke-nautilus/), [Ortovox Andermatt Vest](http://www.bergzeit.de/ortovox-andermatt-vest-blue-ocean/), [Black Diamond Alpine Start Hoody](http://bit.ly/OcTdRJ) and [Montane Sabretooth jacket](http://bit.ly/1gHaaxw). A look at durable outdoor phones and hiking socks, an interview with Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner, and gear for kids recommendations round out this issue.
