[Bergzeit](http://www.bergzeit.co.uk/) is one of the biggest German Outdoor Shops that has both Brick & Mortar stores and an international online presence. Can this mountaineering and trekking shop come up with a good ultralight gear list?

I have been a [Bergzeit](http://www.bergzeit.co.uk/) customer for quite a while, they usually have very competitive prices, regularly good discounts on gear and shipping Europe-wide is just 10€ and it's fast - usually my order is on my doorstep within five days from clicking "Order". Especially if you're a climber then Bergzeit should be on your radar, but they also have a vast selection of high-quality hiking and backpacking gear - and you can make a very nice ultralight list, as you can see here:

<br>**Total Weight**: 5.559 g
<br>**Total Price**: 2.430,00 €

My thoughts on the list:

- An affordable and lightweight list, which with a couple of changes could be even lighter and cheaper!
- The big three are sub 3 kg, and even with the excellent sleeping pad it's just a tad over 3 kg
- The Laser Competition 1 is a much liked tent, though again I would have liked to see a tarp!
- Evernew pot + EOE gas stove, a solid choice
- All garments are superb choices, nice to see Inov-8, Haglöfs, Berghaus, Outdoor Research and Devold in there
