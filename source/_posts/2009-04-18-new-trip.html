<span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;">I was planning to go this weekend for a trip to <a href="http://luontoon.fi/page.asp?Section=4998">Isojärvi</a> National Park, which is also close to Tampere, however, both my heels still have open blister so walking is rather painful. Which is a shame, really, as outside the sun is shining and Temperatures are -3°C and are expected to drop to -8°C tonight, which would have been an excellent opportunity to test my winter sleepingbag under good conditions - last weekend it was too hot.<br /><br /></span><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://luontoon.fi/image.asp?Image=Att7249\webatt_20090311_145045_679868.gif"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 545px; height: 562px;" src="http://luontoon.fi/image.asp?Image=Att7249\webatt_20090311_145045_679868.gif" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">Isojärvi is a nice national park for weekend trips, it has a few lean-to shelters which mean you don't need to bring a tent - which is good news for me, as I don't have one yet. Anyhow, up the map of the Isojärvi NP. I reckon my feet should be fine till next weekend, thus if I don't go to Helsinki I will go and have a good time in Isojärvi. Starting in Huhtala its a nice trip to walk till Vahterjärvi, stay there for the night and then continue the next day to Heretty. From there it should be easy to hitch a ride back home to Tampere.</span></div>
