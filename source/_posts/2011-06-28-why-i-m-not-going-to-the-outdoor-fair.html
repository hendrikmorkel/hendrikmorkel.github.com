Every year again there are a few events which the major players in the outdoor industry have us think we should attend, or at least listen attentively to the news heralded. We have the ispo and Outdoor Retailer in the spring, and now the OutDoor fair in the middle of July. And every year again, companies ask if I will be there, if we could meet. Every year my answer is the same: No, I'm not going. <br /><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/041I71wED998xWp8dHxwTEHt8Z1qUqjXw3zMJWMxCOw?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Z4Xgxu2wuZ8/TgmFNqYXfCI/AAAAAAAAEvA/2E_bFs2KUKg/s640/_DSC1563.JPG" height="426" width="640" /></a><br /><br />Fairs a stressful. Running 12 hours for three days around the place, meeting new people, having small talk with strangers who will tell you about the latest and greatest "innovation" in their product line, exchanging business cards and the promise to "getting back in touch" later on. Sleeping in rented tents on camping places, next to those snorring outdoor journalists - Well, #!&@≤ that. <br /><br /><i>Newsflash</i>: A new colour and a slightly different cut to your jacket is no innovation. Shaving 200 gram of your 3 kg internal frame backpack is no "major improvement in comfort". Saying you are now "ecological" because your product is now made out 30% recycled plastics, while it is still made in China and is shipped half way around the globe, well, go back to the drawing board & read up on the term sustainability before you trumpet such garbage out. Also your hyper-duper-steam-breathing material is no major improvement, and your plutonium powered stove surely is no improvement over a simple cat stove what-so-ever.<br /><br />Of course I might be alone with this opinion. Because increasingly you read about Bloggers who get "Press Passports" and travel hundreds of kilometers to a fair, just to be the first to report on a new jacket or tent, shake hands with marketing folks and get free gear for testing. A quick look at these "outdoor" bloggers shows that they're not that much outdoors at all, but have a review about the latest gear up every other week. <i>Newsflash</i>: Walking to the supermarket ≠ backpacking. And those who think I'm hypocritical because I too write reviews about relative new gear: <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=meh"target="_blank">Meh</a>.<br /><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/YeeGWvUgjWyuixG6Ph_WxEHt8Z1qUqjXw3zMJWMxCOw?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-gwvt5boXSfo/TgmGFlMRq3I/AAAAAAAAEvk/KN4OtnpZLKU/s640/_DSC1680.JPG" height="172" width="640" /></a><br /><br />Instead of going to fairs, squeezing myself through hordes of people, looking at a new colour, hearing about a new "feature", I go and do what an outdoor blogger should do. I go out <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/search/label/trip%20report"target="_blank">backpacking</a>. Afterwards I might check what <a href="http://lighthiker.wordpress.com/2010/07/06/outdoor-show-the-lightweight-preview/"target="_blank">Roman</a> has to say about his finds, but that's it.<br /><br /><i>What is <b>your take</b> on outdoor fairs in general? Great events for us hikers, backpackers, paddlers & cyclists or a waste of time? Add your voice & let us know!</i><br /><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/tkqD9XsX2dxWovOUufHUF0Ht8Z1qUqjXw3zMJWMxCOw?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-oEh2_Vb3lm4/TgmGIasVA7I/AAAAAAAAEvw/F8FglXJZKoI/s640/_DSC1696.JPG" height="201" width="640" /></a></div>
