You want to have a full set of links here, as a magnificent month of fine ultralight backpacking, bikepacking, packrafting, tenkara fly-flyishing, gear and news is gone by since the last "<a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/search/label/The%20Week%20In%20Review"target="_blank">The Week In Review</a>", and you need your fix. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/5564955276/" title="Untitled by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5176/5564955276_a069c7c95b_z.jpg" width="640" height="426" alt="" /></a><br /><br />I feel bad to tell you that I didn't have the time to go through over 2000+ different posts which have collected in my RSS Reader since I left to do my <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/search/label/internship"target="_blank">internship</a>. So instead of spending a day or more going through it all, I did hit "Mark All As Read" and decided to start fresh for next weeks post.<br /><br />To not completely stand here with empty hands:<br /><br />Japan was hit by terrible natural disasters, and besides the thousands of lives which have been lost and the houses and infrastructure which has been destroyed, also the environment itself has suffered. The <a href="http://hikesinatra.blogspot.com/p/japan-hikers-association.html"target="_blank">Japan Hikers Association</a> accepts donations to restore hiking trails and the environment, and I urge fellow hikers and backpackers to show their support for our Japanese friends. <br /><br /><a href="http://natureaddict.blogspot.com/2011/03/terror-in-night-and-grand-shelters.html"target="_blank">Terror in the night</a> is a mighty fine post from Tomas which you should have read.<br /><br />Laufbursche shows off his <a href="http://laufbursche.blogspot.com/2011/03/laufbursche-lavvu.html"target="_blank">Cuben Laavu</a> (as well as the monoLOGE and tanzPALAST) which will certainly stir up some interest.<br /><br />The Backcountry Boiler is in the wild and <a href="http://www.theboilerwerks.com/2011/03/people-and-dogs-seem-to-like-it/"target="_blank">people love them</a>. I'm still waiting...<br /><br />Short and sweet. Check back next week Sunday, when business will resume as usual.<br /><br /><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/21504913?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ff3c00" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
