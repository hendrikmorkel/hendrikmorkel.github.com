##Gear

Carsten had the good fortune to try a [Lightwave Firelight 450 down sleeping bag](http://blog.fastpacking.de/wordpress/lightwave-firelight-450-ultraleichter-daunenschlafsack/) and he fell very much in love with it.

The [ESEE Candiru 1.7oz Fixed Blade Knife](http://www.briangreen.net/2012/11/esee-candiru-17oz-fixed-blade-knife.html), a knife for the Ultralighter? Possibly, but it also could be Timo's [Ultralight MYOG Fixed](http://tontbloggt.blogspot.fi/2012/11/messer-ultraleichtes-myog-fixed-auf.html).

Chad lets us take a peek at his [GooseFeet Gear Custom Down Pants](http://sticksblog.com/2012/10/28/goosefeet-gear-custom-down-pants/).

Jake made some [DIY Tyvek Rain Gear](http://www.barefootjake.com/2012/10/diy-tyvek-rain-gear-long-term-review.html) and now reviews after plenty of (ab)use.

Anna and Chris share their experience with three different [Water Filters and Containers for Ultralight Backpacking](http://wanderingthewild.com/2012/11/03/gear-review-water-filters-and-containers-for-ultralight-backpacking/).
