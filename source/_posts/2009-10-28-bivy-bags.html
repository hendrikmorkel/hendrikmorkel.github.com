Together with looking for a <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2009/09/gear-talk-golite-ultra-20-initial-review.html">tarp</a>, I'm also in need of a bivy bag to keep the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/2009/09/gear-talk-golite-ultra-20-initial.html">Ultra 20°</a> dry from rain and dampness and increase the warmth rating of the quilt a bit. <br>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7381684016/" title="A bike and a bivy. by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8148/7381684016_5aefe0f5e9_o.jpg" width="4912" height="3264" alt="A bike and a bivy."></a>
<br>
I had a look around, and these are the bags I found which would suit my needs. The bivy doesn't need to be water resistant as I will be under the tarp, so waterproof is enough (I don't water resistance, though =). It should have good breathability and be light. Pretty much the standards, thus. Use is spring till autumn and in winter to increase the rating. Here the ones I am considering:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.titaniumgoat.com/Bivy.html">Titanium Goat Ptarmigan bivy</a><br />- 164 g in Intrepid/ Silnylon<br />- Mosquito netting, no zipper<br />- 90$<br /><br /> <a href="http://www.rab.uk.com/equipment/bivvis/ultra_bivi---70/">Rab Ultra Bivy</a><br />- 220 g in Pertex Quantum Endurance<br />- short zipper<br />- 65€<br /><br /><a href="http://www.integraldesigns.com/product_detail.cfm?id=821&CFID=1161559&CFTOKEN=57196832&mainproducttypeid=1">Integral Design Micro Bivy</a><br />- 535 g in eVent/ 70 denier coated nylon<br />- hood & draw cord, no zipper<br />- 210$<br /><br /><a href="http://www.mountainlaureldesigns.com/shop/product_info.php?cPath=22&products_id=39&osCsid=16ae04d23cde8a116479ca7d73e31cab">MLD LiteSoul Bivy</a><br />- 125 g in Momentum/ Spectralite .60<br />- no mosquito net, dual zipper<br />- 245$<br /><br /><a href="http://www.mountainlaureldesigns.com/shop/product_info.php?cPath=22&products_id=37&osCsid=16ae04d23cde8a116479ca7d73e31cab">MLD Soul Bivy</a><br />- 195 g in Momentum DWR/ Silnylon<br />- bug netting window, two sets of inside and outside sleep pad strap loops, top can be made in eVent<br />- 205$<br />- I also can imagine the <a href="http://www.mountainlaureldesigns.com/shop/product_info.php?cPath=22&products_id=38&osCsid=1ae63005ffeaf98b41fc0cf1ebca5d7f">Soul Bivy with a side zip</a><br /><br />I know there's heaps more out there, and even a MYOG Tyvek bivy, like eg <a href="http://theotherface.wordpress.com/2009/03/11/myog-tyvek-bivy/">The Other Face</a> has made, would be sufficient for my needs, though somehow I prefer to get it in slightly more durable material. As this is again a fairly new topic to me, I am curious to hear which bivy you use.
