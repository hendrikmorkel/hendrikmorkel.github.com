<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"><a href="http://qbloggt.blogspot.com/">Q bloggt</a> is a German UL blog, and it had a raffle for the German UL Bible - <a href="http://www.conrad-stein-verlag.de/show_book.html?isbn=978-3-86686-285-2&edition=3">Trekking Ultraleicht</a>. I am a lucky winner, and soon will be able to read this useful book, which comes now in colour! It should hopefully help me to decrease the weight of my backpack to under 5 kg, which is my goal for this year.<br /><br />And while I am talking about German UL blogs, I would like to mention the <a href="http://gearandmore.wordpress.com/">Trekking-Gear & More</a> blog, which is written by Steffi and Christian and reports about UL gear. Updated almost daily, it is certainly worth a look as they cover a lot of interesting gear. Click the language button of your choice on the right.<br /><br /><a href="http://barleybreeder.wordpress.com/">Barleybreeder's blog</a> is another blog I read regularly. A lot of very interesting MYOG projects will keep you inspired and busy reading, and updates should follow in September as he is crossing Iceland currently! <br /><br /><a href="http://www.trailblaze.de/">Trailblaze</a> is a German UL blog which I always enjoy to read, and it has an English button so is also for those who don't speak fluent German a useful source ;) Very interesting is his Fjällräven CLASSIC 2009 report, which he walked with a pack weight of 6 kg!<br /><br />Finally, <a href="http://lighthiker.wordpress.com/">Lighthiker</a> has been silent lately but he changed his blog layout. I believe his latest project, interviews with cottage manufacturers, is keeping him busy. I'm looking forward to the first interviews and podcasts, though, and hope they're coming soon!</span></div>
