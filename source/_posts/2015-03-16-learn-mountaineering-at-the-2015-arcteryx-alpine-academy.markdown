I wrote in detail about the [2014 Arc'teryx Alpine Academy](http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/07/arcteryx-alpine-academy-2014.html) and just booked my flights for this year's event. If you want to learn about mountaineering, alpine climbing and the skills needed to safely cross a glacier on a hike, then you should right now surf to the [Arc'teryx Alpine Academy website](http://arcteryxacademy.com) as registration for the clinics opens today. Here's the teaser to get you in the mood:

As in 2014 the ‘Compagnie des Guides de Chamonix’, the ‘British Mountain Guides’ (BMG) and the Chamex Guides together with Arc'teryx Athletes like Ines Papert, Luka Lindic, Nina Caprez and Mina Leslie-Wujastyk will teach you the skills and know-how to enjoy the mountains. New this year is the Clean-Up-Day on Thursday, the 11th of June, where the athletes and participants clean the mountains from rubbish. I'll be there for that occasion, and can highly recommend you are too so you can get acclimatized before you head up to the Aiguille du Midi =) 

You can read about the [logistics of getting and staying there](http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/07/arcteryx-alpine-academy-2014.html) in my article from last year, and check out the [2015 Clinics](http://arcteryxacademy.com/shop/) now so you know what to book. I have no doubt that the most popular courses will be fully-booked in a matter of minutes, so act quickly! New courses this year are [Advanced Technical Alpinism](http://arcteryxacademy.com/product/clinic-06-sun-advanced-technical-alpinism/), [Traditional Climbing](http://arcteryxacademy.com/product/clinic-11-sun-traditional-climbing/), [Big Wall Climbing](http://arcteryxacademy.com/product/clinic-19-sun-big-wall-climbing/) and [Ski Alpinism](http://arcteryxacademy.com/product/clinic-20-sat-ski-alpinism/) and there's again exclusive Women's courses, too. And make sure to join the [Academy Dinner](http://arcteryxacademy.com/product/ad-mountain-dinner/) on Saturday evening before the [Movie Night](http://arcteryxacademy.com/movie-night/). It's going to be a superb event and I am super psyched to be going there again this year, and if will be there - be sure to [let](https://twitter.com/hendrikmorkel) [me](https://www.facebook.com/hikinginfinland) [know](https://plus.google.com/u/1/b/105082905705272949032/105082905705272949032/posts) so we can have a chat! 

See you in Chamonix in June!
