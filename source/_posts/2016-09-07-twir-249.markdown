*“Real adventure is not polished. It’s not the result of some marketing budget, there’s no hashtag for it. It burns brightest on the maps edges but it exists in all of us. It exists at the intersection of imagination and the ridiculous. You have to have faith, it will find you there. And when it does, remember, there’s just one question. In this life, when the road comes to the end, will you keep pedalling?”* - Kyle Dempster
