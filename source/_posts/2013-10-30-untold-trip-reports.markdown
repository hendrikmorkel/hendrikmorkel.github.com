*Unsung heroes, untold stories. So much time outdoors, so little time to write about them.* **These are the Untold Trip Reports.**

## Packrafting in Ruunaa

I was just back from the [OutDoor Fair](http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/outdoor-fair-2013/) when I saddled two packs with packrafts on my shoulders to travel to Ruunaa, where I was teaching a packrafting course. It was a very wet weekend, though we laughed, paddled and hiked a lot. One more packrafting aficionado joined the tribe, eagerly waiting to acquire his own, taking it on future adventures on rivers and lakes.

## Backpacking in Seitseminen

Another course with three superb clients, we were backpacking for three days in the beautiful Seitseminen National Park and learned about ultralight skills and gear. Gathered mushrooms, swam in the lake, sat around the fire and slept warm in hammocks and quilts, while the sun shone down on our trail.

## Kungsleden

A failed trip is also a trip. After the [Abisko Ice Climbing Festival](http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/03/abisko-ice-climbing-festival-2013-experiences.html) I had an ambitious plan to ski a loop on the Kundgsleden, though as I took a fall while ice climbing where I injured my knee the skiing was just too painful, and so I returned after having skied 20 km on brand-new skis which I would have loved to take up some fjells. Alas, it was not meant to be, though I will return soon enough for a re-match.

## Dayhikes & Overnighters

The largest amount of untold stories are the dozens of [dayhikes](http://www.outdoors.fi/destinations/WorldHeritageSites/kvarkenarchipelago/activities/Pages/Default.aspx) and overnighters here in the region. Plenty of great outdoor destinations around Vaasa, not only the [Kvarken Archipelago](http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/05/a-family-hike-on-the-bodvattnet-runt.html) which it counts to explore - by bike, packraft, on foot, and soon again on skis and snowshoes.
