On our second [One Stop Shop](http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/one-stop-shop/) stop we visit [CampSaver.com](http://bit.ly/131V0vk) and see if a online store from the USA can take the lead in offering the lightest gear list for aspiring lightpackers!

[CampSaver.com](http://bit.ly/131V0vk) is well known in the USA, and increasingly also in Europe and elsewhere - they offer free shipping to a lot of countries, and their prices are very competitive. But will the gear they suggest to us be lighter than what the [Trekking-Lite-Store.com](http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/one-stop-shop-trekking-lite-store-dot-com.html) had to offer? Well, lets see:

<br>**Total Weight**: 5316 g
<br>**Total Price**: $2748,98 (in today's exchange rate that's 1.993,80 €)

My thoughts on the list:

- WOW! That are a lot of European brands!
- Another WOW as I saw the total weight and price - a sub 2000 € list (though one would pay import duties and taxes when buying this from the USA, so price would go up)
- Very nice choices for the stove and pot, though a windscreen probably would be useful, too (CampSaver.com gave me [Trail Designs](http://bit.ly/1ilM2Br) as an alternative!)
- They offered the [Salewa Mountain Trainer Mid GTX Backpacking Boot](http://bit.ly/1r5adsp) as on option for footwear, which had me a bit baffled, but I was happy to see the Salewa Firetail EVO Hiking Shoe listed as an option, which is far better for an ultralight list
- Very nice garment choices, can't go wrong with a Patagonia R1 Hoody and the Rab & Arc'teryx shirts
- The Big Three (Pack, Shelter, Sleep System) are 2775 g which is very good and will make [Jörgen](http://www.fjaderlatt.se/) happy!
- Overall a great list that is very light and for a very good price

The table thus far:

| [Trekking-Lite-Store.com](http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/one-stop-shop-trekking-lite-store-dot-com.html) | 6157 g | 2.288,80 € | 0,47€ per gram
| [CampSaver.com]() | 5316 g | 1.993,80 € | 0,52 € per gram

<br>Next week we'll see what [Globetrotter](https://www.globetrotter.de/?utm_source=PTID13002584), [Partioaitta](http://www.partioaitta.fi/Etusivu) and [Bergfreunde.de](http://www.bergfreunde.de/) come up with.

**Disclaimer**: *The [One Stop Shop Series](http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/one-stop-shop/) was [Carsten](http://blog.fastpacking.de/)'s idea and he gave me permission to translate his posts to English and contact a few more shops around the world. If you can read German, you can head over to his blog and read already the first posts with the gear lists from [Globetrotter](http://blog.fastpacking.de/wordpress/one-stop-shop-eine-komplette-ul-ausruestung-von-globetrotter-frankfurt-teil-3-11/) and [Bergfreunde](http://blog.fastpacking.de/wordpress/one-stop-shop-eine-komplette-ul-ausruestung-von-bergfreunde-de-teil-411/).*
