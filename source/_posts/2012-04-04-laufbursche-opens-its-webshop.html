LAUFBURSCHE, as many of you know, has been for a long time working behind the scenes on offering their gear commercially through a webshop. To open a cottage gear business in Germany is not as easy as it is in other parts of the world, and Mateusz has been working on it since we first meet in the winter of 2010, when we sat around a fire talking about a his creations and how a webshop would allow people across the globe to purchase his meticulously crafted backpacks, tarps and other innovative gear. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.laufbursche-gear.de/"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-O4u2n0uGSKU/T3w1PmNkI1I/AAAAAAAAGVc/MIb-xP3u6Qg/s800/LAUFBURSCHE-gear-is-online.jpg" height="239" width="800" /></a><br /><br />It is thus with much pleasure that I tell you that the LAUFBURSCHE webshop opens today, where you can purchase some of <a href="http://www.laufbursche-gear.de/backpacks/"target="_blank">the best ultralight backpacks</a>, Handcrafted in Cologne, Germany: The <a href="http://www.laufbursche-gear.de/backpacks/huckepack/"target="_blank">huckePACK</a>, the <a href="http://www.laufbursche-gear.de/backpacks/huckep%C3%A4ckchen/"target="_blank">huckePÄCKchen</a> and the gorgeous Special Edition for the opening of the shop, a <a href="http://www.laufbursche-gear.de/special-offers/"target="_blank">white XPac huckePÄCKchen</a>!
