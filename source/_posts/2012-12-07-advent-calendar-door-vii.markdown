Dear Santa,

With all the fine gear you have brought me so far it is time to get something to carry it around with. [Elemental Horizons](http://www.elementalhorizons.com) makes some very fine ultralight packs, and I have taken a liking to their [Kalais Pack](http://www.elementalhorizons.com/kalaispack.aspx). 736 grams in Size M, it has a total volume of almost 48 liters and thus should hold plenty of gear and food when out on the trail. It is Made in the USA, uses Dyneema X Gridstop which means it is rather durable, has a V-Stay Lite Suspension System which allows me to carry up to 15 kg comfortably while the three external pockets allow plenty of space for snacks, a wet tarp and other gear that needs to be accessed on the go. All around a great pack - and it comes in Red! I'd be a very happy hiker if you bring me one today!

Happy trails, 



*An aspiring UL Backpacker*
