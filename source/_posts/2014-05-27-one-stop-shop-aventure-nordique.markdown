Adventures in the North - that's what [Aventure Nordique](http://en.aventurenordique.com/) stands for. They sell fine gear for your winter adventures here in the north, and also know something about lightweight hiking gear, as you will see!

[Aventure Nordique](http://en.aventurenordique.com/) popped up a couple of years ago in France, and helps you with all your Nordic Backcountry skiing needs - be it pulkas, the [great OAC skis](http://en.aventurenordique.com/oac-kar147.html) (they ship world-wide!), maps for planning your route and warm clothing, chances are that Aventure Nordique has it. Régis, the owner of Aventure Nordique, has been on several long skiing expeditions, on which he has learned a thing or two about packing light for a backpacking trip, as you can see from their OSS list:

My thoughts on the list:

- The big three are again very good choices and even with the pad included are under 3 kg!
- Nice stove and pot combo
- I don't know why a short Titanium Spork was chosen, but I'm a fan of long-handled spoons as they make eating from bags easier
- Nice knife! I would prefer the classic Opinel with a wooden handle, but this one is likely more durable and functional in wet weather
- Interesting choice for a lamp. I wouldn't want to rely on it when needing to hike in the dark, pus you'd need fuel to power it. For camp it's probably fine, though
- A light & interesting rain gear choice. Easy to put on, keeps the pack dry, and the chaps add also warmth on cold, rainy days
- Solid garment choices, nice combo of synthetics and merino wool
- Overall a great list which with one or two changes would be very nice!
