Dear Santa,

with snow on the ground there is no reason to hike or cycle - snow means it is time to ski. And the [WAP 127](http://skinbased.com/5/) from [OAC](http://www.oacsport.fi) is the perfect tool to ski - from home to the cabin, up the hills and down the slopes. Best thing: I don't even need to get expensive ski boots, as I can use my normal winter boots thanks to the [OAC EA Binding](http://skinbased.com/10/) where I can step in with my winter boots or trailrunners alike and go to the fjells. The patented Unicoat base structure of the WAP 127 allows me to climb steep hills and have great grip on any snow. And at just 1.050 g they're lighter than many snowshoes - and a lot faster and more fun, too! With these winter will be a lot of fun, so please bring me a pair!
