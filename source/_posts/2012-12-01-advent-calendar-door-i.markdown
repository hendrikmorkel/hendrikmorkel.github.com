Dear Santa,

after a year of sleeping on the ground I decided it is time to lift myself of the floor and try a hammock. I read [a smart book about hammocking](http://hikinginfinland.com/2012/01/the-ultimate-hang-ultralight-backpackin-tips.html) and figured out that a good suspension system is what makes or breaks a good nights sleep, and thus I'd like to ask you for a pair of [Whoopie Slings hammock suspension system](http://whoopieslings.com/) in my choice of colour & size for my hammock. That should ensure an easy setup of my hammock and keep me hanging high!

Thank you, and a fine start into December!
