Dear Santa,

photography when outside is one of the many things which gives me pleasure. Being able to share my trips with loved ones at home is just great. And the [Peak Design Capture PRO](https://www.peakdesign.com/product/clips/capturepro/?acc=97) makes capturing these moments a lot easier, because the camera is always close by - right next to me! Connected to it in one way or another is always the [SlideLITE](https://www.peakdesign.com/product/straps/slidelite/?acc=97) camera strap, the ultralight strap which helps me keep my camera safe when I'm hanging 140 m off the deck. And the final piece of gear is the [Shell](https://www.peakdesign.com/product/covers/shell/?acc=97), a stretchy fabric cover for my camera which protects it from snow, rain and dust while still allowing me to capture those special moments out on the trails and in the hills. With these three items photography outside is easy, safe and comfortable - ideal to capture every special moment!
