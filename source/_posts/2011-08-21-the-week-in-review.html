The Week In Review does not replace reading other blogs. You still should follow and subscribe to other blogs, as The Week In Review is my subjective look at things I found really good in the last week. With that said, I'm really curious to know how much value The Week In Review gives to you. I know some readers stop by on Monday morning, load up Instapaper with the recommended reads, and find it ace for the convenience it presents. Other bloggers like the boost in traffic it gives them. Some probably totally dislike it. Thus, with this simple poll I'm able to find out if it is worth to carry on with The Week In Review, or if it is time to give it a funeral and carry it to the blogpost graveyard.<br /><br /><script language="javascript" src="http://www.PollJunkie.com/Embedder.js"></script><br /><script language="javascript">    polljunkie_id = 12523;    polljunkie_code="JAm38C";    polljunkie_width = "250";    polljunkie_height = "150";    polljunkie_bordercolor = "#D56E22";    polljunkie_bar_color = "#000000";    polljunkie_bar_bg_color = "#E7E7E7";    polljunkie_showPoll();</script><br /><br />You can leave additional questions, comments & observations about TWIR in the comments.
