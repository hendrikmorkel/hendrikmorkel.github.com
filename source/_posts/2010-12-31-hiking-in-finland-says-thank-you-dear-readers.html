In the words of someone much more smart, well articulated and funny than me: <br /><br /><iframe title="YouTube video player" class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="510" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/iMUiwTubYu0?rel=0" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /><br />It's just a ride. <br /><br />My thanks go to all the fine readers and smart people who comment and regularly check in here, you keep me motivated and inspired to write and share my stories with you. <br /><br />Many, many thanks go out to all the fine folks whom I have met due to this wee blog - the guys from the Trekking-Ultraleicht.de Forum who entrusted me with organizing their <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/02/tufwt-10-trip-report.html"target="_blank">Winter Tour</a>, Phil and Steven who came for a <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/05/pirkan-taival-virrat-helvetinjarvi-np.html"target="_blank">sauna and fire trip</a> to Finland, my fellow Nordic Lightpackers whom I met for <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/06/ul-fellowship.html"target="_blank">an adventure in Vålådalen</a>, <a href="http://goinglighter.blogspot.com/"target="_blank">Thomas</a> for his hospitality in Oslo, <a href="http://backpackingnorth.blogspot.com/"target="_blank">Mark</a> for his willingness to meet me for a beer in Tampere, as well as Matti for going on a <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/03/siikaneva-trip-report.html"target="_blank">snowshoeing & skiing trip</a> and Xavier for his patience in <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/04/salamajarvi-national-park-trip-report.html"target="_blank">Salamajärvi National Park</a>. Also a big thank you to <a href="http://www.petesy.co.uk/"target="_blank">Peter</a> whom I very nearly met - I am sure in 2011 we will climb some mighty Scottish peaks and wildcamp there. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53783299@N08/5304294020/" title="Winter by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5169/5304294020_dc7d5f8074_z.jpg" width="640" height="426" alt="Winter" /></a><br /><br />So while I am already venturing out to 2011 and what will happen, what more can you expect? Well, my Wilderness Guide education will see me skiing a good seven weeks around in Finland between February and April, and a Canoe (<a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/08/packrafting-in-finland-first-strokes.html"target="_blank">Packrafting</a>!) trip is scheduled as well. School ends in the end of June, just in time for some summer adventures. I reckon autumn will be that golden time where I might take clients to see the beauty of Lapland, and before you know it, it will be December again.<br /> <br />The "<a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/p/ultralight-z.html"target="_blank">Ultralight A - Z</a>" video series will start to appear soon-ish. Gear and Book Reviews will be coming at a steady flow. Ultralight climbing and mountaineering will make its debut on this site. More trips. A new design. Plenty of stuff to stay tuned for. You keep reading and commenting, and I keep writing, video- and photographing.<br /><br />And remember: It's just a ride.</div>
