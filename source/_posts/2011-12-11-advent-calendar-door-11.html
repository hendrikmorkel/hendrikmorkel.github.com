One name kept on popping up in my research, that of <a href="http://www.traildesigns.com/"target="_blank">Trail Designs</a>. They developed this thing called the Caldera Cone, which is pot support/ holder plus windscreen rolled into one. Genius, I tell you, Santa. But that wasn't enough for them, and they developed something called the <a href="http://www.traildesigns.com/stoves/caldera-keg-f-stove-system"target="_blank">Caldera Keg-F</a> - the lightest commercial cooking system on the market! It makes use of an [empty] Fosters beer can, which you use as a pot. It has a 12-10 stove, a fuel bottle and a cozy for the pot included, pretty nifty, I think. All of it can be transported inside the can, or inside a caddy to give a bit of extra protection. A sweet deal, and you won't need to rob a bank to get me one!<br /><br />Best,<br /><br /><br /><i>- An aspiring UL-Backpacker</i><br /><br /><a href="http://traildesigns.com/"target="_blank"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-0D5MP1pyLiQ/TuPMrvOb4YI/AAAAAAAAFog/eKDpVAHfvxs/s640/Screen%252520Shot%2525202011-12-10%252520at%25252011.00.13%252520PM.jpg" height="255" width="640" /></a><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/euYG1esOwIsmdXP-Dom4JmiBcik-iSu3FtqWq-IAnas?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-HFpP48qFCKE/TuPMwmlT0zI/AAAAAAAAFok/Xc3jD7puoiU/s640/DSC01604.JPG" height="498" width="640" /></a><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/6Ab3k6tU1UNeogZexyWFmWiBcik-iSu3FtqWq-IAnas?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-rF0raZYe6eE/TuPMyVPJtGI/AAAAAAAAFos/gW9hU_8ce20/s640/DSC01609.JPG" height="426" width="640" /></a><br /><br />Draw a picture - digital or analog - of you using the Caldera Keg-F System and leave it in a comment underneath - you got till 18 o'clock Finnish time, so get those oil, pastel or water colours out and start painting ;) <br /><br /><b>UPDATE I</b><br /><br />Dear Readers, you keep on amazing me!
