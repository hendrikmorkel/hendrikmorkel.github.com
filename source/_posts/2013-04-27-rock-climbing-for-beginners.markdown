You maybe have been climbing indoors at the gym, possibly have done some bouldering outdoors, but now you want to scale granite & lime walls and learn the skills it takes to climb them in a safe and fun manner. You could read a book about it, definitely should go to a course for it, but in the meanwhile these superb videos will teach you the basics of rock climbing in an illustrative manner that will give you a head start in your rock climbing career!

*Disclaimer: Climbing is immense fun. It's a great exercise for the body and mind, and a superb reason to go and see new places and climb there. Sure, you could fall down, break a leg, or die. But that can happen just as well in the city. So go out and climb!*

Books, the *old media*, are still a great way to learn about climbing, to deepen you knowledge, and use as a reference. There's [plenty](http://amzn.to/10yMiFh) [of](http://amzn.to/15TXlOf) [good](http://amzn.to/12AOvjo) [books](http://amzn.to/15TXMrI) [and](http://amzn.to/107Cz5P) [some](http://amzn.to/10yNicl) [more](http://amzn.to/1129CqD). I also find magazines very inspirational - less maybe for techniques, but more so for destinations and stories, and can highly recommend you to subscribe to [Alpinist](http://alpinist.com/), [Rock & Ice](http://www.rockandice.com/) and [Climb](http://www.climbmagazine.com/). But what they lack is the possibility to show you in a fluid motion how to for example set up an anchor, use a rappel device correctly and many more things, which are just easier to understand when seen in motion.

Now you always should try to meet local climbers who could teach you, join your local climbing club, or visit a course at your gym so that an expert can show you all those very important things. In Finland for example [SKIL](http://climbing.fi/skil/) will help you find these people, while in Germany the [DAV](http://www.alpenverein.de/) will be the best source to gain information. 

But until you're able to visit a rock climbing course, there happily is the internet. More specifically, Vimeo and Youtube. Besides a whole host of inspirational videos of [gorgeous places](http://youtu.be/EcU255XBlcI), [interviews](https://vimeo.com/42687933) and product demonstrations there's also a very good selection of technique videos. Underneath you will find a very good selection of these videos - from Beginner to Advanced, you surely will learn something from these even if you have been climbing for years!
