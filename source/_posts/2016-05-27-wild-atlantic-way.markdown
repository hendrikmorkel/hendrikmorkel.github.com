Last year I was lucky enough to [explore Ireland](https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/04/sea-stack-climbing-in-ireland.html), hike the IAT and go sea stack climbing. What caught my interest and brought me to the Green Isle, however, was the Wild Atlantic Way: The worldâ€™s longest coastal touring route which goes from south to north along the west coast and is over 2.500 km long. There's all kind of adventures to be had along the WAW, from visits in picturesque Irish villages and their pubs to bigger towns and their cultural offerings. However, [Exploring Ireland's Wild Atlantic Way](http://threerockbooks.com/index.php/exploring-irelands-wild-atlantic-way/) helps you find the off-the-beaten-track gems and takes you outdoors into the fresh, Irish air (and occasional rain shower!). 

On 224 pages *Exploring Ireland's Wild Atlantic Way* takes you from the south in Kinsale to the far north of Malin Head along the coast. In seven chapters - divided by county - you can start to explore the Wild Atlantic Way. Do you fancy surfing, sea stack climbing and lots of remote wilderness? Then head to Donegal in the north. Do you prefer a cable car ride to an island, trying your luck fishing or going cycling? Then Cork in the south is a good place to start your adventures! Wherever you decide to go, *Exploring Ireland's Wild Atlantic Way* will have an insider tip ready for you. The seven county chapters are further divided into sections, each coming with their own little overview map to give you a feel of the land. Hundreds of gorgeous photos will get you in the mood to explore, while the detailed introduction chapter gives tips on when to come, what to bring and any other question you may have.
