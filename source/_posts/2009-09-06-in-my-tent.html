<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">I'm back from the over nighter, and it was a fun trip. There's wasn't a drop of rain, Saturday had splendid sunshine and blue skies and today it was grey and humid, but alas no rain. I might post a trip report next week with some more photos, though after inspirations by <a href="http://blogpackinglight.wordpress.com/2009/08/29/in-my-tent-2/">Robin</a> and <a href="http://v-g.me.uk/blog/outdoor-gear/slow-recovery-and-another-in-my-tent-picture/">Geoff</a> I thought to show you the inside of my Scarp 1:<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/OkLbaO9EjJ6wgb5ocn8EkA?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/SqPfckqzqlI/AAAAAAAAAUg/92DuifnsPRg/s800/DSCN0342.JPG" /></a><br /><br />On the top left is my small pack sack, where I keep my towel and spare socks. Next to it, in the NeoAir pack sack, my 1st Aid kit and Hygiene bag, to the right a empty bottle of Minttu liqueur and next to it my kitchen in its bag. In the green pack sack I keep my food, on the top my phone and a Light-My-Fire cup. Then my torch, toilet paper and a 1l Platypus if I get thirsty during the night. My <a href="https://www.smartwool.com/#/Mens/Socks/PerformanceSocks/_/227/">Smartwool Hiking Mid socks</a>, which I wore over night in front of the open porch. NeoAir and GoLite Ultra 20Â° in the middle, very nice combo. And under my feet was my Ohm, which was very comfy and isolated well. My <a href="http://www.rab.uk.com/clothing/shell/new_momentum_jacket---131/">Rab Momentum Jacket</a> and <a href="http://www.rab.uk.com/clothing/shell/new_drillium_pants---133/">Drillium Pants</a> where at the foot end, out of the picture, as were my shoes. Everything fits nicely inside, and there was room to spare! </span></div>
