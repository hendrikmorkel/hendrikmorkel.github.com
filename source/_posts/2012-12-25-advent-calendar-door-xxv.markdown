Dear Santa,

Xmas has been superb thus far, you've brought me plenty of great, lightweight gear, though now that I was planning to go out for a hike to lose some of the calories which have started to accumulate from all the good food & cookies, I realized that two rather essential pieces of gear are missing: A bivy and a tarp in case it snows or rains. [Terra Rosa Gear](http://terrarosagear.com) makes a superb [sleeping bag cover/ bivy](http://www.terrarosagear.com/quiltbagcover.htm), and the one I'd like would have a Tyvek upper for superb breathability and a Silnylon bottom for a bit more water protection. It's a superb combination of breathability, waterproofness and weight, and will be all I need for Cowboy Camping under the stars! However, Murphy's Law suggests that it snows and rains when one goes backpacking, and thus a [Wandering Tarp](http://www.terrarosagear.com/tarpshelters.htm) would add a lot more protection for a bit of extra weight. It's versatility is what is really appealing, as I can [pitch it in many different ways](http://www.terrarosagear.com/wanderingtarpphotos.htm). It's rectangular shape and eight tie-out points allow me to set it up in many different ways, and it even could work as a Hammock Tarp! The combination of this bivy and tarp should be perfect for my post-Xmas trip, thus I'd be delighted to find them later under my tree!

Merry Xmas!
