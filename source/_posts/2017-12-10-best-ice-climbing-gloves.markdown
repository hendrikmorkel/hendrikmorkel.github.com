In the current disclaimer fashion I’m obliged to tell you that although I didn’t receive this Altaplex for nothing, it was discounted in return for this review, whether positive or negative.

Disclosure: Friction Labs has provided the gear for this review, because they’re rad fellas. As rad as they are, I kept my opinions honest and true.

Mammut NA sent The Alpine Start a sample for review but as you probably know by now, this doesn’t influence our opinion of the product.
