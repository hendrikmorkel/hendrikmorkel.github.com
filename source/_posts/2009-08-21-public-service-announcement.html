<div class='post'>
<span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;">There have been some been some questions about the logo(s) at the left side, and its time to shed some light on it. I am fortunate enough to cooperate with some outdoor manufacturers, who provide me with some test gear. <a href="http://www.rab.uk.com/">Rab</a> for example provided me with the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/2009/08/gear-talk-rab-microlite-vest.html">Microlight vest</a>, which I will be testing under different conditions in Finland, and give them some feedback. I'm not getting paid for this, and return the goods after use to Rab. Because I don't get paid and don't get to keep the gear, I can be objective and also can and will report about things I might not like about some gear, so you can expect a honest opinion from me. If I will be convinced of a product, I will buy it. Finally, I also try to get the UL ideas more known in Finland, and introduce hikers to lighter and better equipment.</span></div>
