While I currently am paddling in canoes, kayaks and my packraft in Eastern Finland, there obviously won't be a "<a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/search/label/The%20Week%20In%20Review"target="_blank">The Week In Review</a>" today. However...<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/5723691764/" title="P1010614 by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2201/5723691764_52705365ed_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="P1010614"></a><br /><br />You can <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/hendrikmorkel"target="_blank">follow my adventures live on Twitter</a> while they happen, or browse previous "<a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/search/label/The%20Week%20In%20Review"target="_blank">The Week In Reviews</a>" and read the best of what has happened in the UL community. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/5723694504/" title="P1010633 by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2307/5723694504_b09be36f9a_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="P1010633"></a><br /><br />You also just could go out yourself today, and experience an adventure yourself and write it up for us =) See you next Sunday!</div>
