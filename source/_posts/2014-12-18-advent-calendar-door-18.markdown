Dear Santa,

I have been pondering backpacks yet again. I know, I know, but December I am at home while the rest of the year I'm out on the trail, so now's the time to plan & think. So, winter backpacking. I don't really need a super-large volume backpack - between 40 and 50 l would be sufficient, though it should carry loads between 10 and 15 kg well. Which brought me to [Elemental Horizons](http://www.elementalhorizons.com) and especially their acclaimed [Aquilo backpack](http://www.elementalhorizons.com/aquilo-pack.aspx). It has a roll-top closure, side pockets, an internal sleeping pad pocket that holds my pad securely and helps with weight distribution and finally: A padded harness with ergonomically shaped padded shoulder straps for comfortbale carries in the backcountry when I'm out with those new skis! It's also a super durable backpack and I'm sure I can pass this on to my son when he's older, so it really is a present for him that I'm just breaking in =)

Sincerely yours,


The Ultralighter
