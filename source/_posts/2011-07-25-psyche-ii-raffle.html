<a href="http://www.posingproductions.com/product.php?form_action=detail&product_id=241"target="_blank">Psyche II</a> is a climbing movie, made by Alastair Lee / <a href="http://www.posingproductions.com/homepage.php"target="_blank">Posing Productions</a> in the UK. If the names <i>Leo Houlding</i>, <i>Jason Pickles</i>, <i>El Capitan</i> and <i>Yosemite</i> are familiar to you, then lemme tell ya, you gonna enjoy this movie - a lot. How about a little teaser:<br /><br /><iframe width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/lP078NfMyQ8?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />Looking sweet, doesn't it? In case you don't take my word for it, take that of some who definitely know: The Kendal Mountain Film Fest gave it its Grand Prize Winner and Best Climbing Film Awards, which is only the top of a whole bunch of other awards. But as you're reading here, I reckon you're also slightly interested in what I think of it. Well, as a hobby climber this was a very inspiring movie to watch. It actually had me very psyched to go climbing and bouldering with my mates, which is a good measure on how good a movie is, me thinks. If it motivates you to go out and do what's shown, then that is pretty damn good in my book. If you follow me since a while you know that I love the scenery and wilderness in the USA. I think the country has such a vast amount of impressive wilderness beauty to offer, that every time I read about the adventures of my digital friends I get all excited and wanna go there. Anyway, I digress.<br /><br />Yosemite NP is on my must visit list, and it is a prime destination for climbers and backpackers alike. <i>The Prophet</i> gives spectacular views of this beauty, together with a first ascent of an impressive wall. The quality is crisp & sharp and the filming offers nice perspectives, with a good mix of music and humour which make the about 45 minutes pass quickly. But that ain't all there is to see on the DVD. <i>Hollow Caves, Bleed in Hell, Oceans of Fear, Dusk till Dawn</i> as well as the <i>20 minute Extras</i> are equally impressive, with the Hollow Caves section being my second favourite of the DVD. How about a complete trailer to give you an idea:<br /><br /><iframe frameborder="0" height="360" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/25546934?byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ff9933" width="640"></iframe><br /><br />So, Posing Productions was kind enough to provide me <i>one DVD</i> for a lucky reader.
