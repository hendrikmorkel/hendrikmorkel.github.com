Dear Santa,

after a week of presents it is time to say thank you. You've been generous so far this year, but we're not even 2/3 down the road. I was thinking, what really would be useful when bikepacking and hiking would be a sleeve for my tablet, that way I can read and write while out on the trail - very useful on these long, dark winter nights! [Porcelain Rocket](http://www.porcelainrocket.com/) has a super-cool sleeve which fits my tablet very well - it's well padded to protect my gadget from bumps, dust and scratches and also could cold a traditional pen & paper notebook instead - multiuse! 

Have a nice weekend,
