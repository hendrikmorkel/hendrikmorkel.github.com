Thursday last week <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/hendrikmorkel/status/165373890380574720"target="_blank">I asked on Twitter</a> if there's an interest in an UL podcast. The feedback was overwhelmingly positive; though questions came up which I will try to answer here. <br /><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/TjfK3kHFuTnwVKo70Bu6wtWLrcQKe3Y0VwcxsVmzDnU?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-WKu-R8DGWhA/TypSYVy-8ZI/AAAAAAAAGGc/FEtXjXiuQ-o/s640/DSC02201.JPG" height="426" width="640" /></a><br /><br />First off, let me tell you about my favourite podcast of all time: Fell Calls. Four friends which sit down and discuss all stuff Warmachine and Hordes, a superb miniature game from <a href="http://privateerpress.com/"target="_blank">Privateer Press</a>. A very relaxed atmosphere, funny, informative, and just about the best thing I can imagine when painting Minis. <br /><br />And that's the format I want to do with this UL podcast as well. Mates talking about UL skiing, backpacking, bikepacking, packrafting, climbing, skills, people, gear and trips. A bit of a direction for each show, but not being afraid to improvise and possibly talking about something completely different if that's where the conversation takes us. <br /><br />To keep work to a minimum, it is going to be a podcast in the traditional sense - no video. I find video podcasts tedious, and I doubt it would add anything to it.<br /><br />Making a regular schedule is a nice idea though probably won't work - different time zones, family & work commitments, being outdoors, and needing to get the gear and get familiar with using it all means at least in the beginning it is going to be a "<i>When it happens, it happens</i>" show.<br /><br />Because I know that there's this one other Outdoors Podcast - nope, we're not going to compete with that. This is going to be a young, fresh, Rated R-18 (because we speak about sexy gear and are not afraid to say shit) podcast, made by friends who enjoy UL backpacking and talking about it. <br /><br />I got in touch with a few European UL blogger-friends who agreed to participate every now and then, though I think it'd be fun to make this an international endeavour. So those of you who feel comfortable to chat in English and hail from e.g. Japan, Australia, Germany, Netherlands, USA, Belgium, Russia - well, anywhere, really - and you have an interest in ultralight outdoor adventures and aren't afraid to talk about it - <a href="mailto:hendrik.morkel@gmail.com?subject=UL Podcast - Count me in!">Email me</a>. <br /><br />So yeah, that's that. Once we're set to go, you'll surely read about it. I for one am very excited about it!<br /><br />---<br /><br /><b>Update 07.02.2012</b><br /><br />Unintentionally I phrased my initial post above in an ambiguous way. When I wrote that I and other participants of this endevour do not intend to compete with The Outdoors Station I meant just that. We don't aim to compete.<br /><br />My mistake was to write in the same paragraph that we aim to be "young, fresh, Rated R-18" and here some interpreted that I implied that the aforementioned podcast wouldn't be that. This was not how it was meant, and I am sorry if Bob Cartwright and other members of The Outdoors Station (and other possible podcasts, just to be sure) felt this was meant as an insult. Please accept my apology.</div>
