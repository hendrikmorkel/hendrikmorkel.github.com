Open Wilderness Huts, Laavus, Kotas and Fireplaces are something I dearly love about the outdoors experience in Finland. It's just very sophisticated to be able to plan a backpacking trip and rely on laavus and huts for sleeping, or know that there will be a fireplace in the mid point of the hike for a nice lunch break by the fire. [Tulikartta.fi](http://www.tulikartta.fi/) set out to index all public shelters - from Laavus and Kotas over Wilderness Huts to Fireplaces - in one easy to use map, which makes it an excellent tool to plan an overnighter!

## Prologue

In the past and still in the present [Outdoors.fi](http://www.outdoors.fi/) and [Retkikartta.fi](http://www.retkikartta.fi/) have been the digital services I have used to plan a trip in Finland. The former lists all National Parks, Wilderness and Hiking Areas in the country, with information on history, how to get there, history and services available. Retkikartta is a highly detailed map which you can use to create routes, measure distances and look up coordinates to huts up to a scale of 1:2500, save and print out directly from the browser or export to your [GPS device](http://bit.ly/1Dk1sCb).

This is a good way to plan a backpacking trip, but if you wanted to find a shelter for a day trip it would have been a bit too involved. Enter Tulikartta.fi which facilitates finding a shelter a lot!

## An introduction to Tulikartta.fi

A couple of weeks ago I read a tweet with a link to [Tulikartta.fi](http://www.tulikartta.fi/) and I was immediately intrigued. A map of fire? Click, and I was there.

It didn't take me more than a look and a bit of reading to figure out what I had in front of me: A superb tool to plan overnighters and backpacking trips in Finland where I don't want to carry a [shelter](http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/shelters/) or might, for extra comfort and because I love a nice fire, camp close to a hut, fireplace or laavu. I set out to experiment a bit with it and see what kind of outdoors infrastructure the map listed around Vaasa, my home town.

Plenty of options to take the [bike](http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/11/pelago-bicycles-stavanger.html) and head to one of these places, make a fire and sleep outside. I also saw that a few fire places, bird towers and laavus were missing on the map, but happily the people who developed Tulikartta also thought of that and you can add a listing yourself.

I need to say it is one of these services where you might think "Why has no-one thought of this before?". I like it alot already and it has given me plenty ideas for adventures close to home in-between the bigger trips this year. Using the existing infrastructure allows me to go ultralight with the bike and leave a shelter and [stove](http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/stoves/) at home and make use of a nice Lavvu by a lake and grill a bread and sausage over a fire. 

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16366741123" title="Laavus in Finland by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7647/16366741123_af56d6f95c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="628" alt="Laavus in Finland"></a>

Right now the service is only in Finnish but it should be easy enough to use also if you don't speak this beautiful & easy language. To get you started: Laavu = an open shelter, Autiotupa = a open, free-to-use Wilderness Hut, a Kota = a native Saami tent, similar to a tipi from wood, P채iv채tupa = A Day Trip Hut and Nuotiopaikka = a Fireplace. The shelters usually also have a fireplace and a dry toilet close by to them, too, along with a woodshed and the obligatory saw and axe. Now that you know where to find the next shelter & fireplace head out and enjoy the Finnish nature!
