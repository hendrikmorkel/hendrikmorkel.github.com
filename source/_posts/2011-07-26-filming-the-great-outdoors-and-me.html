Terry is a (digital) mate from the UK. I think most of the regular readers, which look over the borders of this site, have seen his superb videos, humours articles and candid reviews ob his blog <a href="http://terrybnd.blogspot.com/"target="_blank">terrybnd</a>. So it is a great pleasure to have Terry here today for another <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/search/label/guest%20article"target="_blank">Guest Article</a>, in which he tell us about his passion - filming in the great outdoors. Enjoy!<br /><br />----<br /><br />From a very young age I was always encouraged to get outdoors into the British countryside - learn about it’s flora and fauna and appreciate our place within it. My grandfather was ex-military, a landowner and big lover of the land and nature. So, it won’t come as a surprise he was a big influence on me as a modern day backpacker.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-US8gqynhwfY/SaWi2q-bHxI/AAAAAAAAAb8/i9LZ7c5YR1M/s912/SANY0005.JPG" imageanchor="1" style=""><img border="0" height="571" width="912" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-US8gqynhwfY/SaWi2q-bHxI/AAAAAAAAAb8/i9LZ7c5YR1M/s912/SANY0005.JPG" /></a></div>Terry on a Lakes trip in February 2009.<br /><br />I can recall how he would sometimes wake me up at 3am and drive me to some remote part of Sherwood Forest, walking in the dark with no torches - to observe foxes, badgers, deer and more. Admittedly, I found it exciting and scary in equal measure but nonetheless inspiring. Fun was had too by making impromptu shelters out of bracken and tree branches - and on more than one occasion I’d wake to discover I was covered in ticks!<br /><br />Roll along twenty-something years, and things haven’t changed. I still get an enormous thrill exploring the landscape of the British Isles, albeit now my shelter is constructed from nylon and I sleep on an air mattress inside a down bag. But it’s enjoying those moments of sheer surprise and intimate beauty that never ceases to lift my spirits on so many levels.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-c6lNoECYBYU/S4LBA6zCpBI/AAAAAAAADaM/khl_1D8_dDo/s1024/SANY0048.JPG" imageanchor="1" style=""><img border="0" height="577" width="1024" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-c6lNoECYBYU/S4LBA6zCpBI/AAAAAAAADaM/khl_1D8_dDo/s1024/SANY0048.JPG" /></a></div>Terry's mates on a Yorkshire Dales Wild Camp, February 2010.<br /><br />It’s a cliche, I know - but tramping atop bleak and barren moors, knee deep in heather cursing the day was born and suddenly by chance you observe a break in the cloud and watch in awe as the sun casts it’s rays down on the lands below. The varying colours igniting into life, shadows stretching long and far exaggerating the finer details of a land shaped by man and mother nature for millennia. It’s pure joy for me - and it’s such sights and many more that only us backpackers the world over get to appreciate that led me to taking a video camera with me on my hikes.<br /><br />In my early twenties I worked as an illustrator, so you could say I know more than most on what can make an engaging picture. However, such a person can create and embellish an image with the end viewer in mind - and to a large degree modern day photographers can, too via the likes of RAW files and Photoshop. But with video - it’s much trickier. Unless you’re a Hollywood studio, there’s not a great deal of manipulation one can do with scenes you may record.<br /><br />And it’s that last aspect that proves to be a real challenge when you begin to take video equipment into the great outdoors. You have to be in the right place at the right time. You have to go where the weather takes you, and not so much where you desire to be and consequently hope for the best. In essence, you’re filming the real deal - you’ve hiked and camped aiming to capture that special moment or exhilarating scene - in effect what all backpackers do but without the camera gear.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-A4hBMFaCx40/S19uL1zS-NI/AAAAAAAADCY/VNv2Aa6EqTw/s576/SANY0207.JPG" imageanchor="1" style=""><img border="0" height="576" width="432" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-A4hBMFaCx40/S19uL1zS-NI/AAAAAAAADCY/VNv2Aa6EqTw/s576/SANY0207.JPG" /></a></div>Something Terry is well-known for - spectacular sunsets and rises. <br /><br />We all take photos of our trips out, so why not video? There’s something visceral about filming trips and places that you just can’t capture in a still image. And there’s no excuse in this day and age with video capabilities on our mobile phones or compact digital cameras.<br /><br />Over the past few years, I’ve tried to develop my video making skills more and more - with a desire to not only capture the landscape at it’s very best but with the intention of sharing the sights seen with other people. Be it with like-minded souls or those who are new to exploring the outdoors.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_ppA2Gb9U2M/S19r2E3rGuI/AAAAAAAAC6Q/B4zSBy9TKRM/s1024/SANY0037.JPG" imageanchor="1" style=""><img border="0" height="412" width="1024" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_ppA2Gb9U2M/S19r2E3rGuI/AAAAAAAAC6Q/B4zSBy9TKRM/s1024/SANY0037.JPG" /></a></div>Cloud inversions are another specialty of Terry. He seems to have a good gut feeling for being at the right place at the right time!<br /><br />And it’s this hobby that has led me down a path where I’m now fortunate enough to make a living out of my landscape work. Nowadays, I get paid to hike and camp for days on end filming all I see - it’s a dream come true. I’ll admit it’s not lead me to financial riches, but you can’t put a price on spending nights out on the hills. I’ve had to make some sacrifices to ensure my fledgling business develops to a sustainable level - some of which is physical as well as mental.<br /><br /><iframe width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/vVu0bQAGQgA?rel=0&amp;hd=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />Sometimes, I don’t want to be out in all weathers sleeping in a tent - I just want to go home, be with my family and have a hearty meal and hot shower!<br /><br />Even so, in the main I enjoy it all immensely and wouldn’t change it for the world.<br /><br />And as my skills have improved, so has the need to take particular equipment - which now consists of a video camera, lenses, tapes, batteries, two tripods and a dolly track - all coming to a total of approximately 6 kilos! Consequently, my base weight on camping gear has dropped dramatically to a maximum of 4 kilos (excluding food and water).<br /><br />All the gear is within the realms of most peoples pockets, too. Sure, I’ve had to save money to get hold of lenses and the like but it’s not cost me thousands. I’m a great believer of leaving things as they are when it comes to images - moving or not. Let the scenery or nature do the talking. Don’t mess about with depth of field or manipulate the colours of a place. Show it all how it really looks to any other soul who may venture there. That’s my philosophy, anyway.<br /><br />It goes without saying that I’ve had to be very conservative with my choice of camping gear. Shelter and warmth is key, water I’ll collect when on the move and of course I’ll take the bear necessities on food, too. So, physically and mentally filming the outdoors has become a challenge on many levels - but I love every minute of it.<br /><br /><iframe width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/bdRYiA7Kex0?rel=0&amp;hd=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />There was one afternoon where I was hiking in horrendous winds and rain on a moor in the Peak District National Park - I hadn’t got much filming done at all as a result. I made my camp resided to defeat by the weather gods and got comfortable by some large boulders sipping on some beer cursing my luck. Just as I was about to head into my tent and get some food and sleep, the clouds parted and the rain eased to reveal the most beautiful panorama over the nearby hills and dales. All the old stone walls of remote farms formed the most wonderful lattice on the land below, bathed in a golden glow. In a flash, I grabbed hold of my camera, held the tripod steady in the wind and hit the record button.<br /><br />I’ve been fortunate to have local wildlife approach my camp on many mornings, too - sat steady and blindly reaching over for my video camera capturing them up close.<br /><br />Another occasion saw me camped on the summit of Great End in the English Lake District during a particularly harsh winter. Not only did I have to contend with the sub zero temperatures but also my camera batteries continuously failing in the cold. All the while I was trying to film a temperature inversion at sunrise, my fingers going numb in seconds (gloves are a real pain when you have to negotiate small buttons and toggles). It was a truly breathtaking sight to behold as a sea of cloud as far as the eye could see gently swirled around beneath me and all the majestic mountains of the Lake District effortlessly poked their heads out into a deep orange sky.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-m5Fg9M3TiTg/TCET9a6tdII/AAAAAAAAEkU/avc4lX4a4BQ/s720/SANY0085.JPG" imageanchor="1" style=""><img border="0" height="540" width="720" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-m5Fg9M3TiTg/TCET9a6tdII/AAAAAAAAEkU/avc4lX4a4BQ/s720/SANY0085.JPG" /></a></div>On a Peak's Wild Camp; June 2010.<br /><br />I could go on and on about all the adventures I’ve enjoyed (and hated) when out filming - but I’m sure I’d bore you to death.<br /><br />But being out in such places and conditions has not only tested my patience and mental strength but kit, too - as you can well imagine.<br /><br />I recall a time where I struggled in deep snow to reach one camp and encountered a bloody awful storm on the summit where I planned to pitch. Poles flew out from the flysheet and into the murk (it was night by the time I arrived), gas canisters struggled to melt snow for drinking water, the tent was collapsing in my face - but through it all I focused on the possibility of capturing some wintry scenes come the morning when I hoped conditions may have improved.<br /><br /><iframe width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/329askO0gds?rel=0&amp;hd=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />And so they did.<br /><br />Ignoring the fact I didn’t sleep very well, I woke to clear skies and crystal clear air with superb visibility. Another morning I’ll forever cherish in my memory.<br /><br />And that’s the thing - memories. They can fade with time, and photographs only serve to remind you of those special moments. However with video you can relive the experience as if you have gone back in time to that very hour of that day.<br /><br />Some people think I’m crazy for doing what I do and to a point at certain times of year and in given terrains, I’d normally agree. But there’s just no better way of enjoying the great outdoors and mother nature, as many of you know. All cares and worries are blown away by the winds and clear air. Your senses are tuned into another world often overlooked or forgotten by the masses. No chitter chatter of hordes of people, no ting tinging of portable music players - only the sound of a breeze, call of birds or even the pitter patter of rain on your tent flysheet.<br /><br /><iframe width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/NJw1E_gIlsk?rel=0&amp;hd=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />Such sentiments have been said many, many times by past and present writers/poets and more so with outdoors bloggers (probably better than I try to describe in words). Cliche, cliche, cliche....so what? It’s true and there’s only so many ways one can describe the sights and sounds we encounter and how it all affects us individually.<br /><br />And for me - I choose to express my feelings via the medium of video. I receive great joy from it and I hope others do, too.<br /><br />*terrybnd works on a  freelance basis.
