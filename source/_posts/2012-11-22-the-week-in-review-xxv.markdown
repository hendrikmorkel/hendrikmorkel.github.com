##News

I sent the first HiF Newsletter last week, announcing some interesting things to come and highlighted some articles. Not yet subscribed? [Then do so here](http://eepurl.com/jCWIX) and [read the first Newsltter here](http://eepurl.com/rRGCz).

[Trekking-Lite-Store.com](http://www.trekking-lite-store.com/trekkingshop/index.php?refID=hif) offers 25% Discount on ultralight tents till the 30th of November!

[Hyperlite Mountain Gear](http://www.hyperlitemountaingear.com/) offer a free Nano Stuff Sack with an order of $50 or a free Medium Stuff Sack with an order of $150 or more!

You could say I caved in, or you could say that a network with one billion members became to big to not be present. So [Hiking in Finland is now on Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/hikinginfinland) where I will keep you up-to-date with interesting tid-bits from the lightweight & UL world, run raffles and answer your questions. Head over and check it out!

[Airpano.ru](http://www.airpano.com/?set_language=2) is a danger to your productivity at work. Because I'm sure you'd rather watch high resolution 3D aerial panoramas from across the globe instead of doing dull office work.
