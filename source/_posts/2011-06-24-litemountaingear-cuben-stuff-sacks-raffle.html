It is Midsummer here in the North, a time of celebration, 24 hours of sunlight, good food, sauna and being together with family and friends. Lets make giving away practical UL <strike>gear</strike> swag also part of this traditional celebration.<br /><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/-nqLwB2ZJc-tUbtKcpccEDWiupv70N-RGKSfyQFBX78?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-FN5d5-aSiQ8/TgTJQk5Qh1I/AAAAAAAAEtU/y2rmackaEtc/s640/P1020917.JPG" height="640" width="395" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.litemountaingear.com/"target="_blank">LITEMOUNTAINGEAR</a> is a new cottage out of Germany (yeah, another one! Sweet for us Europeans, isn't it!) who makes gear for the lightweight aficionado, out of cuben. At the moment they offer stuff sacks, a trekking pole extender and a cuben raincover for your backpack, but shelters are in the making, and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/litemountaingear/sets/72157625930155380/"target="_blank">they look interesting</a>. I'm told in the summer they will continue prototyping gear, and <a href="http://blog.litemountaingear.com/"target="_blank">their blog</a> is likely the right place to check out what's in the making, as well as seeing where they tested it.<br /><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/pSUpqWnixcnEicAzU3Qv5zWiupv70N-RGKSfyQFBX78?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bsFCPqRl33o/TgTJNvFsYlI/AAAAAAAAEtQ/5WxlpLwnIvQ/s640/P1020913.JPG" height="480" width="640" /></a><br /><br />In cooperation with LITEMOUNTAINGEAR and <a href="http://www.trekking-lite-store.com/trekkingshop/?refID=hif"target="_blank">Trekking-Lite-Store.com</a> I am happy to offer you a complete set of LITEMOUNTAINGEAR Cuben Stuff Sacks! Four stuff sacks, weighing 24 grams together and who have a volume of 11 liters combined, they are ideal to keep your gear in order and protected from dirt and water (no, they're not drybags, but cuben is highly waterproof). Size-wise we have the Small bag for your FA and Washing kit, Medium and Large for puffy insulation or your tarp while X Large should hold your quilt or a super-puffy downjacket.<br /><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/LvHKvzkXr_97cup7qxq-hjWiupv70N-RGKSfyQFBX78?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-R1j6khnD54o/TgTJlZBorVI/AAAAAAAAEtk/7sdB0Slt_BY/s640/P1020912.JPG" height="286" width="640" /></a><br /><br />The game is easy: <br /><br />1. <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/litemgear"target="_blank">Follow LITEMOUNTAINGEAR on Twitter</a><br />2. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/trekkinglitestore"target="_blank">Like Trekking-Lite-Store.com on Facebook</a><br />3.
