The latest issue of the [trekking Magazin](http://www.trekkingmagazin.com/) is since last week Friday on the shelves and includes a host of great trip reports and articles about hiking & backpacking, including three articles by yours truly.

I have been writing since well over a year for the German [trekking Magazin](http://www.trekkingmagazin.com/), which is great fun. I very much enjoy writing in German (my mother tongue, after all) and seeing my photos and text published and read by thousands is pretty nifty, too. In the latest issue there's three articles from me in the magazine:

- Planning of a Trekking Trip, in which I give advice about how to plan that next great hike
- A trip report of my hike in the [Urho Kekkonen National Park](http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/09/urho-kekkonen-national-park.html)
- And in my gear column I write about baselayers

I also enjoyed reading my friend [Martin](http://www.martin-huelle.de/)'s Iceland traverse, the E5 adventure between Meran and Oberstdorf and the Eifelsteig story, though there's certainly more in there, accompanied by great writing and photos. In my opinion it currently is the best outdoor magazine for hikers & backpackers on the German market, but then I'm biased =) If you can read German and haven't checked it out yet, take a stroll to your next Kiosk to pick the current issue up, take out a [subscription](http://www.trekkingmagazin.com/abonnement) or order a free [review copy](http://www.trekkingmagazin.com/magazin/probeexemplar).
