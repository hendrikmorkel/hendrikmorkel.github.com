See, in the mountains there's rocks, made of stone - granite, sandstone et al. Hard materials, which can be tough on materials. So for my Alpine & Mountaineering adventures, I reckon I'd be better off with a backpack which is made of slightly more durable materials than silnylon and cuben. <a href="http://www.ospreypacks.com/index.php"target="_blank">Osprey</a> makes some sweet backpacks, and their new <a href="http://www.ospreypacks.com/en/product/vertical_endeavors__snowplay/mutant_28_new"target="_blank">Mutant 28</a> pack looks like it just made for what I had in mind. Light, enough space for a luxurious dayhike or a multiday alpine adventure, the pack can hold my ice axes, has two hydration hose exits, a floating lid with a lid pocket which can be completely removed and a mighty comfy backpanel as well as a superb compression system. <br /><br />Best,<br /><br /><br /><i>- An aspiring UL-Backpacker</i><br /><br /><a href="http://www.ospreypacks.com/"target="_blank"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-YVw2Sl4atiE/TumxCNPzMKI/AAAAAAAAFr0/D-Hj9Iqq6BM/s640/Osprey%252520Logo%252520High%252520Res.jpg" height="484" width="640" /></a><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/yYPcGp1MkVebN2_qR9jVk2iBcik-iSu3FtqWq-IAnas?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-YluILdzpdcQ/Tup5js5AJcI/AAAAAAAAFso/S4EXMcsbtkU/s640/DSC01693.JPG" height="426" width="640" /></a><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Nl_pOIDFRYENbpcHSvnNtGiBcik-iSu3FtqWq-IAnas?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-OT501CED0yc/Tup5lMkxFCI/AAAAAAAAFss/f-82brOpHIo/s640/DSC01695.jpg" height="640" width="426" /></a><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/1H5eTtOz8JIFV82ieU1U3miBcik-iSu3FtqWq-IAnas?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-7ZFYUUqTD9g/Tup5mO5RMMI/AAAAAAAAFsw/3U7KA2OW6XU/s640/DSC01696.jpg" height="640" width="426" /></a><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/_dx9eaSBRFfrviawduz8LmiBcik-iSu3FtqWq-IAnas?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-whXQE_YT5Ug/Tup5ns-PpwI/AAAAAAAAFs0/kegx2zZt9HM/s640/DSC01697.JPG" height="426" width="640" /></a><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/xCGiT8zM5tXB3KlH5FN6gGiBcik-iSu3FtqWq-IAnas?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-MhwHeOV0qc0/Tup5pAuhsHI/AAAAAAAAFs4/b1jEp6mRmpU/s640/DSC01698.JPG" height="426" width="640" /></a><br /><br />Leave a photo of all the (climbing/ ice climbing/ mountaineering) gear you plan to carry in the Mutant 28 if you win it. The pack is a Size Medium - it be good coincidence if you're too!<br /><br /><b>UPDATE I</b><br /><br />Small update folks: You also can post a photo of the gear (not climbing/ mountaineering) you would use the pack with - this makes it hopefully more attractive to many of you =)<br /><br /><b>UPDATE II</b><br /><br />Suspension is killing you. <br /><br />It kills you till Tuesday. <br /><br /><b>UPDATE III</b><br /><br />Excuse the delay in announcing the winners - I was out abroad and out of town till yesterday night.<br /><br /><i>And the winner is</i>...
