<div class='post'>This week saw special attention paid towards the women here on Hiking in Finland with the "Women in the Outdoors" week. It started with an interview of <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/05/interview-kim-coupounas-from-golite.html">Kim Coupounas from GoLite</a>, a look at the <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/05/patagonia-nano-puff-pullover.html">Patagonia W's Nano Puff Pullover</a> and the <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/05/golite-cottonwood-racerback-run-tank.html">Golite Cottonwood Racerback top &amp; Madrone Frontcountry pants</a>, and a trip report of the <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/05/pieni-karhunkierros-trip-report.html">Pieni Karhunkierros</a>. <div><br /></div><div>Another big news was the announcement of the <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/05/scandinavian-ul-bloggers-meet-up.html">Scandinavian UL Bloggers Meet-up</a>, which will bring six bloggers from the north together for a trip in V책l책dalen, Sweden. Geartalk, pristine wilderness and creating friendships will be a superb experience which I am very much looking forward to.</div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"   style="  border-collapse: collapse; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); white-space: pre; font-family:'Lucida Grande';font-size:11px;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/OgHVR1cQ_8WqxLLmZv433jWiupv70N-RGKSfyQFBX78?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S---avQVA0I/AAAAAAAACjc/bh3z5nXG2ac/s800/IMG_0409.JPG" /></a></span><br /><div><br /></div><div>The most EPIC trip which I read about this week was <a href="http://www.tetongravity.com/forums/showthread.php?t=169211">The Southern Spiral</a> trip, which took four friends 33 Days across Wrangell-St. Elias NP in Alaska.
