I was out on my own, and found this beautiful camping spot at the beach, a great view over the lake, let me tell you. The inherent problems of beaches is that they're made of sand, and my Ti Shepard 1 g pegs weren't up to the task of securing my tarp. I needed to run around to search some rocks and sticks to be able to tie-out my tarp, and even fill some of my stuff sacks with sand. After an hour or so I finally had a halfway decent pitch, and set out to enjoy the sunset. During the night I was woken up by my tarp flapping around and the guylines whipping my face - a storm had come up, and my improvised stakes weren't up to the task. In the rain and wind I needed to retire to the forest, where my 1 g stakes were able to do the job, with the help of some rocks on top of them. Back at home I found out I should have got myself a pair of <a href="http://www.toughstake.com/"target="_blank">Toughstakes</a> - those are especially made for sand & snow camping, and would have allowed me to sleep soundly through the night. As I plan to return to that beach, and also go snow camping a few times in the coming winter, it would be kind of you to drop a pair of <a href="http://www.toughstake.com/products/stakes/aluminum/9-inch-small-toughstake/"target="_blank">Small Toughstakes</a> into my stockings when you stop by. I will leave you a photo of my perfect pitch at the beach then next year!<br /><br />Best,<br /><br /><br /><i>- An aspiring UL-Backpacker</i><br /><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/nwCkN6242pkJWhFOAtBtJGiBcik-iSu3FtqWq-IAnas?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-cvy1xFwr6Uo/TtZV40ZN91I/AAAAAAAAFm8/YRMKgp-c8KQ/s640/DSC01596.JPG" height="486" width="640" /></a><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/WW-y4ufh9VHXkN2rp2l8iWiBcik-iSu3FtqWq-IAnas?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-BZOUnoC7ryg/TtZV58GJS0I/AAAAAAAAFnA/ZPfThusnR0c/s640/DSC01597.JPG" height="426" width="640" /></a><br /><br />Leave a comment with a photo of your shelter pitched on sand or snow, and tell a story of how you pegged out the shelter. <br /><br /><b>UPDATE I</b><br /><br />Thanks everyone, some sweet shelter peg-out solutions there =) <i>And the winner is</i>...
