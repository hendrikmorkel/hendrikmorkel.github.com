Dear Santa,

For that Italy hike I mentioned yesterday, I was thinking a true ultralighter probably would use a real summer quilt. So after browsing the [Quilt Comparison Chart](http://www.jacksrbetter.com/quilt-comparison-chart/) on the [Jacks 'R' Better](http://www.jacksrbetter.com) website I came to the conclusion that I should ask you for a [Sierra Stealth](http://www.jacksrbetter.com/shop/sierra-stealth/) quilt. It uses 800 cuin Fillpower Active-dri Down, which has a hydrophobic down treatment that keeps the down drier - great for those evenings and nights where the temperatures drop fast in the mountains and condensation happens. It also has a re-sealable head hole which allows me to use the quilt as a serape - allowing me to leave the down jacket at home and making the quilt really a multi-purpose item. I'm certain that with this fine quilt I'd be the lightest hiker on the trail, Santa, so please bring it to me!

Sincerely yours,


The Ultralighter
