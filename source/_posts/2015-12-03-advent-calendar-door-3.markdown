Dear Santa,

staying warm in winter - it's something we Northern people know about. Hailing from Canada [Arc'teryx](http://arcteryx.com/) belongs to the illustrious circle of companies which know how to keep alpinists, skiers and backpackers warm when the temperatures drop below 0°C. Their [Atom LT Hoody](http://arcteryx.com/product.aspx?language=EN&gender=mens&model=Atom-LT-Hoody) is not just one of their most popular midlayer insulation pieces which is great when cold wind howls through the mountains & tundra, it also works well on its own when it is not freezing cold. Coreloft™ insulation in the torso, arms and hood keep one toasty, and the side panels of Polartec® Power Stretch® with Hardface® Technology add breathability and stretchiness. And when the sun comes out, it packs small and light in the pack - excellent for a winter day out in the hills!
