Dear Santa,

I was thinking: Maybe it's easiest if you just bring me a gift card today, ya know. You could even send that with the post and don't need to come by! I reckon a 150€ gift card from [Bergzeit.co.uk](http://www.bergzeit.co.uk/?pid=81) would be swell. That way I could get a new pair of [Scarpa Boostic climbing shoes](http://www.bergzeit.co.uk/scarpa-boostic-climbing-shoes-cyan-spring/) or a pair of warm [Black Diamond Super Mittens](http://www.bergzeit.co.uk/black-diamond-super-light-mitten/), or even use it as a down-payment on a new [ski set](http://www.bergzeit.co.uk/ski-set/). And as delivery from Bergzeit is free to Austria, Switzerland and Germany or just 9,95€ to the rest of Europe, shipping isn't too bad either. You see, a gift card would be a win-win for both of us!

Sincerely yours,


An aspiring lightpacker
