<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">From my <a href="http://hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/2009/05/isojarvi-trip.html">recent trip</a> to Isojärvi National Park I present thee some more wildlife pictures and stories. There was no shortage of wildlife on this trip, and as I sat down this afternoon to remember all the impressions I decided to share some additional photos.<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&current=IMG_2622.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2622.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a><br />Frog spawn<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&current=IMG_2632.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2632.jpg" border="0" alt="Isoj&amp;auml;rvi"></a><br />Groupsex and a happy onlooker<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&current=IMG_2688.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2688.jpg" border="0" alt="Isoj&amp;auml;rvi"></a><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-throated_Diver">Black-throated Diver</a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&current=IMG_2778.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2778.jpg" border="0" alt="Isoj&amp;auml;rvi"></a><br />The first spring flowers<br /><br />These weren't all, but I was too slow to snap pictures of the other animals. A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Pheasant">common pheasant</a> was seen while walking on the grit-road. A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Woodpecker">Black Woodpecker</a> I saw on my way to the Kalalahti lean-to shelter, its pecking sound was heard already way before I finally spotted it. The Black-throated Divers - there were two couples on the Kuorejärvi lake - has an incredible <a href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/b/blackthroateddiver/index.asp">call</a> and I was first thinking that an Elk must be in the forest across the lake - how wrong I was! They also had quite show going on after dawn, running two full circles in the water around the island and slapping their wings in the water. <br /><br />There were a few more birds I saw, but being far from a expert on birds I wasn't able to identify them. However, I managed to <a href="http://www.allaboutfrogs.org/weird/general/frogtoad.html">distinguish</a> the frogs and toads. Toads are considered frogs, but there is the sub-species of the "true toad". I saw a common toad which disappeared into its underground shelter as I approached, not even two meters from my sleeping place. All the frogs and toads showed that it was an amazingly healthy environment I was in, as they are considered a good indicator for an intact ecosystem.<br /><br />I already mentioned the two pike earlier. I heard an Owl at night, but am not able to tell which species. Thus all in all, quite a variety of wildlife for only two days out in the forest. Sure, there was nothing huge like an Elk (of which I saw two the weekend before, as I was fishing with my father-in-law in Vaasa) or rare like a lynx or bear, though I was happily surprised about the amount of wildlife I saw. I expect it will increase even during the following weeks, as spring turns to summer. Thus I hope to be able to snap some more photos of the wildlife here in Finland on my next trips, about which I will tell you soon more. </span></div>
