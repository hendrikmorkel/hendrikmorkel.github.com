There were over two dozen entries for the [trip report contest](http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/03/trip-report-contest.html) and it was hard to narrow them down to the finalists. But here they are - six great adventures!

First: Thanks to all the participants. I enjoyed finding new websites and reading about all kind of adventures - from packrafting to bikepacking to winter hikes and skiing trips. There were videos, superb photos and great stories, and we spent a good deal of time to read them all and pick our favourites. So thank you to all who entered! 

The following are the six trip reports which we liked best. They're listed in no particular order, and you should read all six of them before casting your vote. They're excellent stories of outdoor adventures, very nicely written and with great videos and photos.
