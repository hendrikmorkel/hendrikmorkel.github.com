I know you're expecting "<i>The Week In Review</i>" here, though I have an important personal note to share with you.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/6226913045/" title="Saturday sunset II by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6034/6226913045_34d929f435_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="Saturday sunset II"></a><br /><br />I'm excited to tell you dear readers that I am moving onwards and leave Finland and Europe behind. I was offered an exciting position in the USA at a start-up in stealth mode, and will be relocating to North Carolina on the East Coast of the USA. Working with start-ups is close to my heart, and I think this one will offer a fantastic solution to a problem which concerns us all. I'm very happy about this opportunity, even if it means leaving the forests, lakes and hills of Finland behind.<br /><br />Obviously this move will make the name of this blog odd - not being in Finland anymore and writing under the "Hiking in Finland" name doesn't work, hence I renamed the blog appropriately to "<i>Hendrik's Hiking Blog</i>" and will continue to focus on ultra-lightweight hiking, bikepacking, packrafting, climbing trips and gear, just in a new, exciting environment. The US obviously has a lot to offer in terms of wilderness, and I am looking forward to explore its mountains, forests, coasts and lakes.<br /><br />After ten years living in Finland it is not easy to leave this gorgeous country behind, with all the friends and family I have here. I'm certain I'll return often here to visit friends and family, stock up on Minttu and enjoy a good Sauna with a swim in the lake. I hope you will continue to follow my adventures, even if they are no longer in Finland!</div>
