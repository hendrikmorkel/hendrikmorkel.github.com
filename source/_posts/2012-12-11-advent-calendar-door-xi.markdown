Dear Santa,

you know what's so troublesome with all the swell cottage gear from the USA, Japan, Canadan, Australia et al.? That we need to pay unreasonably high import taxes when the customs get hold of our gear. Happily, though, [Trekking-Lite-Store.com](http://www.trekking-lite-store.com/trekkingshop/index.php?refID=hif) helps us Europeans with this - we can easily buy from them cottage gear, get fast shipping, pay in Euros and don't need to bother with the customs. Perfect! Thus, Santa, for my [Gossamer Gear hipbelt pockets](http://www.trekking-lite-store.com/trekkingshop/Rucksaecke/Gossamer-Gear-Hip-Belt-Pockets::336.html?refID=hif) you don't need to fly to the USA, you just can get them at Trekking-Lite-Store.com for me. With the hipbelt pockets I can pimp my backpack and carry in them all those essentials which are useful to access throughout the day - snacks, Point-and-shoot camera, compass, et al. so it's like an upgrade to my current backpack! 

Un saludo, 



*An aspiring UL Backpacker*
