<div class='post'>Busy with life and work but still want to know what happened in the UL world last week? Do not despair, this is your rescue, a concise post with what happened the UL world over - and a lot happened. But before I dive in about UL news, I'd like to inform you about <a href="https://flattr.com/">Flattr</a> as you surely have seen the button on top and beneath the latest posts. Just watch the short video to see what Flattr means:<br /><br /><object height="385" width="640"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/9zrMlEEWBgY&hl=en_US&fs=1&color1=0x234900&color2=0x4e9e00"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/9zrMlEEWBgY&hl=en_US&fs=1&color1=0x234900&color2=0x4e9e00" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object><br /><br />Concrete this means, Flattr is a social micropayment platform that lets you show love for the things you like - for example my blog. You help support the people you like and enable them to continue with what they do, and you yourself also can add your own things to Flattr and recieve appreciation from others. If this sounds good to you, visit the Flattr website and request an invitation to use the service, which still is in Beta thus not completely mature yet.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/R213OT_CTSNBTkXpAm9ClQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S-A36e-yOJI/AAAAAAAACYk/m2IDwwmxYRY/s800/P1040469.jpg" /></a><br />Phil and Steven on the Pirkan Taival trail.<br /><br />The highlight for me this week was Phil's write-up of our trip together last week - <a href="http://phil-turner.net/?p=949">Part 1</a> and <a href="http://phil-turner.net/?p=953">Part 2</a> - simply because it is interesting for <span style="font-style: italic;">me</span> to see how others like it here in Finland; and Phil (and Steven) both seemed to like it heaps! Thank you both for the great trip =) <br /><br />Roman Dial got a call from Andrew Skurka, who was pondering to fly out and give up on the original route. <a href="http://packrafting.blogspot.com/2010/05/skurka.html">Read here what Roman told Skurka</a>. And to follow Skurka live on his Alaska-Yukon-Expedition, check out his <a href="http://twitter.com/andrewskurka">Twitter</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://rioleichtsinn.wordpress.com/2010/05/04/tulft-3-0-ul-zu-gast-bei-laufbursche-in-koln/">RioLeichtsinn</a> is giving all of us who missed the TULFT 3.0 meet-up a look at what exactly we missed, a highlight is surely the "Erlk√∂nig" photo of a LAUFBURSCHE huckePACK made from Dyneema! <br /><br />Also <a href="http://hrxxlight.com/?p=216">hrXXLight was attending</a> the TULFT 3.0, and shot a splendid video of showcasing how many people fit into a LAUFBURSCHE Tanzpalast.<br /><br />hikingharry is currently writing up his trip report of the <a href="http://hikingharry.harrydesign.de/category/korfu/">Corfu Trail</a> so if you fancy some sunshine, bright colours and mountains, go have a read!<br /><br />From far away and gorgeous Japan Hana 2010 - Yamanashi Hyakumeizan is getting <a href="http://hana2009.wordpress.com/2010/04/24/grounded/">grounded for a month</a> after Hana (the dog) started to limp at the end of peak four - get well soon!<br /><br />Ross Collard from Mountain Missions went on his first wildcamp in 15 years - <a href="http://mountainmanjunior.blogspot.com/2010/05/old-man-of-coniston-wild-camp.html">check out his trip report and photos here</a>!<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/ka0XecMe12Y94S5vL0nX7A?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S-A4VgvC5ZI/AAAAAAAACZE/TFi6_cD-RSc/s800/P1040502.jpg" /></a><br /><br />In the gear department, I made a video about <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/05/packing-your-frameless-backpack.html">how to pack a frameless backpack</a> - the video is online again =) - and I am looking forward to your question, comments and observations!<br /><br />Looking for a tripod but didn't yet find one that suits the bill? Knilch has a superb <a href="http://ultraknilch.blogspot.com/2010/05/myog-fotostativ.html">MYOG carbon tripod guide</a> which helps you make your own - and it even can be used as a StickPic!<br /><br />Another MYOG Guide, for a Simple Wood Gas Stove, can be found on the blog of <a href="http://journeyofbushcraft.blogspot.com/2010/05/how-to-make-simple-wood-gas-stove-large.html">Journey of Bush Craft</a> and it has mighty fine looking instruction photos as well - a worthy project for all pyromaniacs! <br /><br />Minimalgear is giving us a first look at the <a href="http://minimalgear.blogspot.com/2010/05/cladera-ulc-fusion-first-look.html">Caldera ULC Fusion</a>, a prototype stove system Trail Designs made for him. <br /><br />Lighthiker tells us about his LAUFBURSCHE huckePACK and how <a href="http://lighthiker.wordpress.com/2010/05/03/laufbursche-huckepack-or-sewing-as-an-art/">he got worried that there wasn't one faulty seam</a> - it was just perfect. <br /><br /><a href="http://backpackbasecamp.blogspot.com/2010/05/evernew-ti-dx-backpacking-stove-burning.html">BackpackBaseCamp.com</a> did a nice video of the Evernew Ti DX wood burning stove, and shows us how to use it and how long it takes to boil a cup of water.<br /><br />Also <a href="http://www.andyhowell.info/trek-blog/2010/05/05/talking-new-stoves/">Andy Howell has a look</a> at the Evernew Ti DX stove, and shows Bob from <a href="http://www.backpackinglight.co.uk/">BPL.co.uk</a> using it - a worthy read!<br /><br />And when speaking of the Evernew Ti DX one needs to mention Fenlander, as he did a sweet video of <a href="http://fenlander2.wordpress.com/2010/05/05/more-information-for-alcohol-stove-users/">comparing the Evernew alcohol stove with the Trail Designs 12-10 stove</a> and lets us know which one is more fuel efficient.<br /><br />Ryan Jordan tell us about <a href="http://www.ryanjordan.com/weblog/2010/05/separation-anxiety.html">Separation Anxiety</a> or how he went from twelve different shelters to just three to cover all possible situations. I think we all can learn something from him yet again. <br /><br />If you're looking for an in-depth review of the Zebralight H30, head over to "<a href="http://www.alittlebitaboutnotalot.co.uk/2010/05/gear-review-zebralight-h30.html">A Little Bit About Not A Lot</a>" and read this excellent one.<br /><br />The Jolly Green Giant did a <a href="http://jolly-green-giant.blogspot.com/2010/04/better-than-neoair.html">review of the POE Ether Elite 6</a> and is wondering if it is any better than the NeoAir.<br /><br />Jonas from nature-base has developed a 400 g light <a href="http://blog.nature-base.de/2010/05/07/ultraleicht-pulka/">UL Pulka</a> and is making us curious about it with a few photos.<br /><br />Finally, in case you think life has dealt you a hardship because you can't be out hiking as much as those above or can not afford the latest in gear, have a look at the <a href="http://thebackpacker.tv/2010/05/03/love-life-the-tale-of-steve-fugate">Tale of Steve Fugate</a> and I am sure you're going to rethink your situation. <br /><br />In that sense, all the best for the week ahead!</div>
