It has been a loooong time since my <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/10/kupilka-review.html"target="_blank">Kupilka</a> post, and a lot has happened in the <a href="http://www.kupilka.fi/en/home/"target="_blank">Kupilka-verse</a>. Time to let ya know what has happened and to celebrate, raffle off some fine Kupilka swag! <br /><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/AyduFVmx9LDX8fMWwDmoaw?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-6v1bnibHbdQ/TfsHpXY61QI/AAAAAAAAEp8/RI7L7dUf6u0/s640/P1020880.JPG" height="421" width="640" /></a><br />Some brand-spanking new Kupilka gear is up for grabs, including...<br /><br />Well, Kupilka has expanded. Was it last October available from Finland, <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/index.php?cl=search&searchparam=Kupilka&searchtype=vendor"target="_blank">Germany</a> and a few other countries, you now can get it from all around the world, and the company is expanding as you're reading this! I know there are a lot of readers from the USA, so you will be really happy to hear that you now can get it from US vendors!

Woohoo!<br /><br />What you need to do? Start by <a href="http://www.facebook.com/Kupilka?sk=wall"target="_blank">liking Kupilka on Facebook</a> - so you can stay up-to-date with the new gear coming, news and raffles like these. You also should <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/KUPILKA"target="_blank">follow Kupilka on Twitter</a> for similar reasons, as well as quick responses to questions and interesting conversations. Not on Facebook or Twitter? No problem. It just gives you extra points in the raffle.<br /><br />So, to participate in the raffle, leave a comment underneath, telling me<br /><br />1. What you'd like to get (you only have one pick, choose wisely!)<br />2. What you'd eat or drink with your win<br />3. Did you follow Kupilka on Twitter and/ or liked them on Facebook? This gives you an extra point or two in the raffle.<br /><br />The raffles runs till Sunday, the 26th of June, noon Finnish time. I then will use <a href="http://www.random.org/"target="_blank">magic</a> to determine the winners, and announce them in "The Week In Review" that day. As usually, it is open to everyone around the world, and as in the past, some little surprises might make it into the package to help you enjoy your new swag in style =)<br /><br />I'm looking forward to read what you like to eat and drink, and wish thee a mighty fine weekend!</div>
