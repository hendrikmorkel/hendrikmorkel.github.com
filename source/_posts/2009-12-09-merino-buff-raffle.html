<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">In October I wrote about the awesome <a href="http://hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/2009/10/gear-talk-merino-buff.html">Merino Buff</a> I bought, and which now is used by my girlfriend (because its so warm and fits under the bicycle helmet!). So I got in touch with <a href="http://buff.fi/">Buff in Finland</a> and they were so kind to send me three of their Merino Buffs for a raffle - a big "Thank you!" for Buff for making this possible!<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/CGceZWpl5l1hWKz_ys7v1w?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/Sx6NM1chjLI/AAAAAAAABBM/-n4N8Qem7Fw/s800/buff.jpg" /></a><br />Three new Buffs looking for a head and neck to keep warm. Colours are, from left to right: Cru, Navy and Stone.<br /><br />Participation is very easy: You leave a comment underneath and explain why you should get a Merino Buff and in which style you like to wear it. At the end of the raffle, which will be the 16th of December 2009, I will randomly choose three lucky winners and contact them for their addresses. I ship worldwide, so everyone can take part. <br /><br />In case you can't wait to get one, check out <a href="http://buff.es/index.php?p=0">Buff.es</a> for some videos, and if your in very much of a hurry you can get one at <a href="http://www.partioaitta.fi/">Partioaitta</a> and <a href="http://retkiaitta.fi/">Retkiaitta</a>. I also got some other new items from Buff, which I'll show you in the coming weeks, so stay tuned.</span></div>
