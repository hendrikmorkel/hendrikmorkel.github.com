Issue four has two articles by your truly: My [Lakeland Trip Report](http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/lake-district/) auf Deutsch and in my column I talk about lightweight footwear. Also my colleagues have been busy and write about fine trips from the Black Forest in Germany, the Azores Island Pico, the Dolomites and Austria. Also some [OutDoor 2014](http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/outdoor-fair-2014/) is in the mag though I think you're better off with my articles ;) 

Very happy I am that they printed my barefoot and trailrunning columne without changes - in it I write black on white what the majority of you already know: That hiking boots are not the best footwear for hiking and that with a lighter, more minimalist shoe you can have a healthier stride and more enjoyment in the outdoors. I hope there will be many boot wearers who will try out some of the suggested shoes or similar ones!
