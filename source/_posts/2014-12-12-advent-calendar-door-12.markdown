Dear Santa,

I'm so happy that I got the [Time](http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/12/the-perfect-outdoor-gift.html) to go on a week-long backpacking trip in the spring! I'm already now packing my [Osprey Exos 58](http://www.bergzeit.co.uk/osprey-exos-58-backpack-basalt-black-s/?pid=81) backpack which I got from [Bergzeit.co.uk](http://www.bergzeit.co.uk/?pid=81) to see if everything fits in. It's a lovely, spacious pack and I'm especially happy that it has a ventilated back, and even the shoulder straps and hipbelt are made of a perforated foam which helps with airflow and so allows me to sweat less. And with 58 l volume it stores my ultralight gear in a breeze with plenty of room to spare for food! Ah Santa, I'm so much looking forward to it - please make the weather just be perfect, OK? 

Sincerely yours,


The Ultralighter
