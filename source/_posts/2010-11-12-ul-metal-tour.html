Guitars, drums, bass, pyrotechniques, skulls, lightly dressed ladies, plenty of alcohol, head banging. <br /><br /><iframe title="YouTube video player" class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="800" height="630" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/joEAb_y7ZYA?rel=0" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /><br />Or UL gear talk ad absurdum? <br /><br />Probably a mix of the both, when I join <a href="http://www.petesy.co.uk/"target="_blank">PTC</a> for a walk in the Scottish hills from November 29th till December 1st. <a href="http://www.recipher.co.uk/"target="_blank">Johnny</a> is joining us as well, and <a href="http://stevenhorner.com/"target="_blank">Steven</a> and <a href="http://mcalisterium.wordpress.com/"target="_blank">Fraser</a> are still thinking about it. If you're free for a Monday till Wednesday trip in the early Scottish winter, join us - Peter might even give you a tent to test for two nights! <br /><br /><iframe title="YouTube video player" class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="800" height="630" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/c6y6_xJ0SCY?rel=0" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /><br />Location is still being talked about, but the Cairngorms seem a likely destination. If you can get a couple of days free and feel like testing tents, talking gear, metal music and UL backpacking and see some mighty fine Scottish hills in their winter dress, I suggest you let Peter or me know! See you in Scotland =) And to help us set the tune for this trip, join us and curate the <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/skullmonkey/playlist/5kzbvC28levWls2tXPHwEc"target="_blank">Spotify playlist for the UL Metal Tour</a>.</div>
