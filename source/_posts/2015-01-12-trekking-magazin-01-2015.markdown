My [From Russia With Love](http://hikinginfinland.com/2010/10/from-russia-with-love.html) trip report is still super popular and in the first trekking Magazin issue of 2015 I wrote a trip report auf Deutsch. It's a great looking article and gives tips to plan your own hike in Karelia, so well worth to pick it up just for that. In my gear column I talk about down jackets and review the [Häglöfs Essens II Down Vest](http://www.bergzeit.de/hagloefs-essens-ii-down-weste-noble-blue-s/?pid=81), [Arc'teryx Cerium SL Jacket](http://bit.ly/14pEniz), [PHD Yukon Down Jacket](http://www.phdesigns.co.uk/yukon-down-jacket) and the [Mountain Equipment Vega Jacket](http://bit.ly/1hh35k8).

There's still plenty more in there, from fine hikes in Luxembourg and Sweden to a Winter Gear Guide. Pick up the first issue of 2015 at a Newsstand near you or take out a [subscription](http://www.trekkingmagazin.com/abonnement) to not miss any future issue.
