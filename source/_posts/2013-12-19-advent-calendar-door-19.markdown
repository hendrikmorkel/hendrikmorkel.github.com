Dear Santa,

as an Ultralight backpacker life can be difficult: To save weight you sometimes forgo some features, which on the trail you recognize you'd rather have. An airy back panel in summer is such a feature, I realized through trail trials this past summer. A sweaty back at 34Â°C in the sun just isn't fun. A good thing that [VAUDE](http://www.vaude.com/) has designed a lightweight backpack with such an airy back panel - the [Ultra Hiker 20](http://www.vaude.com/de-DE/Produkte/Ausruestung/Rucksaecke/Ultra-Hiker-20-orange-pebbles.html). At 540 g it's still light enough for day hikes, and 20 l of volume are even enough for an overnighter! Two zippered lid pockets mean I won't lose my keys and wallet like that one time in Utah, and the mesh side pockets will hold a water bottle and snacks. It comes in a nice orange colour, and best of all: VAUDE takes [environmental matters](http://www.vaude.com/de-DE/Verantwortung/Umweltschutz/) very seriously!

Sincerely yours,


An aspiring lightpacker
