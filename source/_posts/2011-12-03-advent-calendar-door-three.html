How the hell am I supposed to carry a tube of mustard for my sausages without that my UL friends make fun of me? Sawing of your toothbrush is one thing, but should I really buy those tiny tubes of toothpaste? Happily I found out that <a href="http://www.trekking-lite-store.com/trekkingshop/"target="_blank">Trekking-Lite-Store.com</a> as a range of small, conveniently sized mini bottles for liquides - those would be ideal to transport my mustard and other liquids in style and be the king among my UL buddies, showcasing true dedication (this re-filling is a messy business, I only can do it if my wife isn't at home). It'd be swell if you could get me one of these, Santa - I would even fill one with a good whisky and leave it on the mantelpiece next year. <br /><br />Best,<br /><br /><br /><i>- An aspiring UL-Backpacker</i><br /><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/c8RS_VLOo0o9eAWduJM1EGiBcik-iSu3FtqWq-IAnas?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-v1PmvS8Enbg/Tten_4FvxRI/AAAAAAAAFoI/mUmWdZ1mOv0/s640/Screen%252520Shot%2525202011-12-01%252520at%2525206.13.58%252520PM.jpg" height="343" width="640" /></a><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/XAEOROS55wFMfaVack3A5WiBcik-iSu3FtqWq-IAnas?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-vkusmm1UXBI/TtZVxUezq_I/AAAAAAAAFmo/ysGPuqgONnU/s640/DSC01586.JPG" height="426" width="640" /></a><br /><br />Leave a comment with the six liquids you plan to carry in them.
