<div class='post'>
I'm on holiday since last Friday. Very traditional in a summer house by the lake, sitting on the veranda, watching Canadian Geese swim by, go fishing, sauna, swimming and BBQ every evening. It is the preparation for four weeks outdoors in the summer, by foot, bike and packraft. There might be an article or two coming during the next weeks, and depending on what the All-Star team of Guest Bloggers has produced for you, also a bit more.<br /><br />On another note: I'm getting tired by self proclaimed "über-awesome-ultimate-epic" trips before they have happened. I don't give a shite if you go walking in the National Park half an hour away or if you go to Siberia (which is a remote place, and not a river which is a few kilometers from a road). If you have the compulsive view to see the outdoors with competition in mind, in terms of most elevation gained, furthest away from civilization, and kilometers walked/ driven/ paddled, then I feel sorry for your limited mental freedom. <br /><br />YMMV, obviously.<br /><br />/Edit: Maybe I was too quick to publish this post to get back to relaxing, maybe my inclusion of "un-epic" day trips underneath wasn't obvious enough: Of course everyone has a different view of what is "<i>über-awesome-ultimate-epic</i>". So Helen expressed it quite well in the comments: <i>I also think that 'epic' is in the mind of the beholder, and what may qualify as epic for one person may leave another cold</i>. With that out of the way, I return to my holidays. Which are epic, btw ;) <br /><br /><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/14912890?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ff9933" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /><br /><a href="http://vwdarkside.com/en/jedi/hendrik-morkel-68024"target="_blank">Join the Rebellion</a>.<br /><br />OK. If you want to put <i>Epic</i> into a trip description, this is the benchmark to reach: <a href="http://epiceric.blogspot.com/2011/07/yakutat-to-gustavus-coast-trip-part-1.html"target="_blank">Yakutat to Gustavus Coast Trip [Part I]</a> + <a href="http://packrafting.blogspot.com/2011/07/magical-mystery-tour-video.html"target="_blank">Magical Mystery Tour Video</a>.
