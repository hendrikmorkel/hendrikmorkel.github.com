Dear Santa,

Rain. Snow. Sleet. Wind. All four a sure way to give you wet, cold hands. Now gloves & mitts are fine to keep them fingers and palms warm, but once the snow and rain come, they'll wet through and gone is all that insulation. Throw in some wind and you got ice blocks at the end of your arms! The only solution is to wear a pair of [Mountain Laurel Designs eVent Mitts](http://www.mountainlaureldesigns.com/shop/product_info.php?cPath=37&products_id=51), which keep the weather away from my gloves and allow my hands to breath, too! All that for a mighty fine 39 gram in the massive Size L - I can wear three pair gloves & mitts underneath them. And apparently they also work as a lucky charm - carry them in your pack and the rain stays away. You may bring me a pair, gracias!

Happy trails,


*An aspiring UL Backpacker*
