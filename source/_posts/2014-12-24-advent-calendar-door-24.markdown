Dear Santa,

it's quite convenient that you are at home in Finland, that way you don't have such a long trip to me. However, [Arc'teryx](http://arcteryx.com/) is at home in North Vancouver in Canada - so almost on the other side of the globe from us, so I just hope you have time to pick up the present I ask you for still! It is well-known that they make some of the best outdoor garments and climbing gear that's available - I love each piece of my [Arc'teryx gear](http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/arc-teryx/). Two years ago they launched their Down garments and I desire a [Cerium LT Hoody](http://arcteryx.com/product.aspx?language=EN&gender=Mens&category=Insulated_Jackets&model=Cerium-LT-Hoody) this Christmas, it'd be perfect for my ultralight adventure next weekend. Made of high-quality Coreloft™ synthetic insulation in the hem, collar, sleeves & underarms and 850 fill goose down is in the torso and sleeves - this Down Composite Mapping strategically places Coreloft™ synthetic insulation in areas where moisture may buildup and down in areas for maximum warmth! It is a great jacket in cool and dry conditions or as a Midlayer, has a toasty hood and the best part is that it's a mere 255 g heavy! Santa, this is the last gear gift I ask from you this year, so please leave one under the tree for me!

Merry Christmas!


The Ultralighter
