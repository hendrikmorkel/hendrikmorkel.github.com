Dear Santa,

long-term thinking beats short-term thinking. Smart people know that, and because I'm a smart aspiring UL Backpacker I already think about spring, summer and autumn trips. And what does one bother in those seasons, which we are untroubled by in winter? Insects! And how can one still enjoy peace in the warm months, sleep and cook untroubled, and keep all his blood? With a [Bugshelter 1.25](http://www.yamamountaingear.com/gear-room/net-tents/bug-shelter-125) from [YAMA Mountain Gear](http://www.yamamountaingear.com). It has plenty of room but doesn't break ones back, with 269 gram it actually is pretty light and the decision between saving some weight or enjoying a insect free night is an easy one to make. It fits under a wide variety of shelters, though is best suited for the very fine [YAMA Shelters](http://www.yamamountaingear.com/gear-room/shaped-tarps). Because I know you're a smart long-term thinking Santa, I'm sure you'd agree to bring me a Bugshelter this holiday, right? 

Have a mighty fine weekend, 

<br>
*An aspiring UL Backpacker*
