Dear Santa,

on my day hikes and backpacking trips a possibility to have a warm cuppa without needing to take out a stove and boil water would be swell. My research has shown that the best way to eliminate the take-out-stove-boil-water-hassle is to use a [Thermos](http://www.mastermarkbrands.fi/thermos) bottle. With it I can can carry enough hot water with me to have about six cups of tea or two cups of coffee and a rehydrated meal, all for a mere 480 gram! Thus, on my wish list today is a Thermos bottle in awesome red. 

Wintry greetings,


*An aspiring UL Backpacker*
