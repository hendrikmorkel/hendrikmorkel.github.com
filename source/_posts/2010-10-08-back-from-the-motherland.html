I'm safe back from the Motherland, aka Russia. It was a good experience, with its ups and downs. While I go through the about 1000 photos, my notes and memories, I leave you with this one impression while I work on the trip report, gear reviews and related articles, which should start to appear during the next week. <br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/1z10uBNwfWDJOt_MrVrT9AaHJjYRDRV4S5g4VqcfkwU?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TK9OMuEAHbI/AAAAAAAADQ4/jUIjU79TuOI/s800/IWG_Russia_0684.JPG" height="800" width="600" /></a></div>
