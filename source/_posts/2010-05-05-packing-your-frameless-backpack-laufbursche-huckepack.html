There are many different packs, but the very lightweight ones usually have one thing in common: They do not have a frame. That is also the case with the <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/03/first-look-laufbursche-huckepack.html">LAUFBURSCHE huckePACK</a>, my pack of choice for the warm months where no water adventures are involved. <br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/9YfDVnfhjo1D4hW47YsiFw?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S-HNlbkKhiI/AAAAAAAACdw/79IJ_7kEnoQ/s800/IMG_6864.jpg" /></a><br />How to get all that gear packed up so that it carries comfortably?<br /><br />With a frameless pack your able to significantly reduce the weight of your backpacking kit, but without some kind of system it might be difficult to get the rucksack packed in a way that it carries comfortable, also if loads are slightly more heavy - for example if you're going for a four day trip and carry food for that time. So while I haven't reinvented the wheel - Minimalgear had a <a href="http://minimalgear.blogspot.com/2009/11/visual-gearlist.html">similar video</a> last year, as had the <a href="http://drw.me.uk/RedYeti/2009/10/18/red-yeti-videocast-1-kit-for-hut-to-hut-in-the-alps/">Red Yeti</a> - I still decided to make a nice HD video of how I pack my LAUFBURSCHE huckePACK and also illustrate some of the great features of the pack at the same time. Thus, please get the chips and beer out and have a go:<br /><br /><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/MDF26eJ2sqU&hl=en_US&fs=1&color1=0x234900&color2=0x4e9e00"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/MDF26eJ2sqU&hl=en_US&fs=1&color1=0x234900&color2=0x4e9e00" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object><br />To watch the video in HD, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDF26eJ2sqU">click here</a> and choose 720 p/ HD. And I do recommend to watch it in HD =)<br /><br />As I set out with <a href="http://phil-turner.net/?p=939">Phil</a> and <a href="http://www.stevenhorner.com/">Steven</a> last week I had food for four days and 1 l of water, which put the complete weight of the gear close to the 8,5 kg marker, and packed as it was shown above the huckePACK carried like a dream. Instead of a "burrito" style of rolling up the mat, I also could use the Z Lite as an internal frame - six to eight pieces work best in my opinion. Given the slightly rectangular shape of the backpack, that is a good choice as well. On the order of my packing, because I go so light it doesn't really matter too much where I put what in the sack; whereas in full frame packs they suggest you pack the more heavy stuff in the middle/ top and close to the back, this is of less concern if you use lightweight gear.<br /><br />Also, as you might be able to see from the video, I love this pack - and <a href="http://lighthiker.wordpress.com/2010/05/03/laufbursche-huckepack-or-sewing-as-an-art/">I am not alone</a>. Sadly there are not yet any (dependable) news on the horizon regarding a shop or website from LAUFBURSCHE, as Roman stated, German law and the cottage manufacturing idea do not work so well together, though I am sure we will see the company see the light of day during the summer, and that demand for these high quality products will quickly have Mateusz make long hours =) Until then, check out the different reviews and photos of the huckePACK!<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/eNosrbJjLYE0e_IKo6BkEg?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S-HNsOw5AKI/AAAAAAAACd0/q9s744OHono/s800/IMG_6872.jpg" /></a><br />The packed rucksack!<br /><br /><a href="http://flattr.com/thing/985/Packing-Your-Frameless-Backpack-LAUFBURSCHE-huckePACK" target="_blank"><br /><img src="http://api.flattr.com/button/button-static-50x60.png" title="Flattr this" border="0" /></a></div>
