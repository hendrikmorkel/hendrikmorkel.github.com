[Wilderness Threadworks](http://wildernessthreadworks.com/ ) is the 2nd Australian ultralight cottage manufacturer I know of, they make nice silnylon and cuben tarps & a 214 g bivy. Great name, too - so check them out!

A 113 g down vest with a water resistant outer, and half of the weight is down? Enter the [Black Rock Vest](http://www.blackrockgear.com/vest.html) - but be quick if you want one, they're very limited indeed!

[Trekking-Lite-Store.com](http://www.trekking-lite-store.com/trekkingshop/index.php?refID=hif) has reduced the shipping costs, and Dutch clients even will pay only half of what they have paid previously! 

Get a free Kindle version of Keith Foskett's book "[The Last Englishman](http://amzn.to/123aVJW)" this weekend!

Also Alex Roddie's book "[The Only Genuine Jones](http://amzn.to/10yA9f9)" is on sale for the Kindle right now, and costs just £0.79! 

Speaking of books: Chris Townsend's next book will be about the The Pacific Crest Trail and will be called [Rattlesnakes and Bald Eagles](http://www.christownsendoutdoors.com/2013/04/next-book-pacific-crest-trail.html). I'm looking very much forward to this book, as it surely will be as inspiring as Chris other books!
