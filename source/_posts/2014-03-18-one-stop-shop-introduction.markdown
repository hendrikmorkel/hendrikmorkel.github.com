The backpacking bug caught you? Or you decided to lighten up? Then you might know about the difficulties of buying a complete ultralight/ lightweight set of backpacking gear at one store. But that it is possible you'll see in this series, where Carsten from [fastpacking](http://blog.fastpacking.de/) & I challenge outdoor shops to offer us a complete ultralight gear list from their shop!

My friend [Carsten](http://blog.fastpacking.de/), an accomplished AT and PCT thru-hiker who has worked previously in an outdoor store, knows that buying ultralight gear is not always easy. A stove from here, a quilt from there, tarp and pegs from that place, a backpack and mat from here and the garments come from another half a dozen stores. That rakes up postage fees and increases the room for things to go wrong - lost packages, long waiting times and different paying methods are all adding up to frustration when you want to buy ultralight gear in one go.

But [Carsten had an idea](http://blog.fastpacking.de/wordpress/one-stop-shop-eine-komplette-ul-ausruestung-in-nur-einem-shop-teil-111/): Challenge a dozen outdoor stores (online, brick & mortar and online shops with a brick & mortar shop) to send him their suggestions for a functional complete gear list of lightweight & ultralight gear, which one can buy normally (no special orders) in their store.

He set out a few Guidelines for the shops to observe:

- Day temperature of 10 to 15°C
- Night temperature of 0 to 5°C
- Rain is possible every day
- Mosquitos aren't there yet
- Tours are 10 - 14 days long

A classic 3-season backpacking trip thus, which would allow you to go hiking from spring till autumn, be it in Oregon, Scandinavia, Nepal or Scotland - the resulting list should give you the possibility to go backpacking in warmer or colder regions with just a few little adaptations. To faciliate things and make them comparable, Carsten asked for suggestions for the following items:

- Backpack
- Sleeping bag or quilt
- Mattress
- Shelter
- Pot
- Stove
- Cutlery
- Knife
- Lamp
- Trekking poles
- Shoes
- Fleece jacket
- Insulation jacket
- Rain pants
- Rain jacket
- Baselayer (Boxers and T-Shirt)
- Longsleeve

The first four items are the big three (sleep system, backpack and shelter) which weigh the most and where one can save the most weight when lightening up. I will translate the first entry from the [Trekking-Lite-Store.com](http://www.trekking-lite-store.com/trekkingshop/?refID=hif) this week, with the others to follow, and also have contacted a few international and European shops to send me their suggestions. Stay tuned, tell your friends, and be prepared for surprises!

**Disclaimer**: *The [One Stop Shop Series](http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/one-stop-shop/) was [Carsten](http://blog.fastpacking.de/)'s idea and he gave me permission to translate his posts to English and contact a few more shops around the world. If you can read German, you can head over to his blog and read already the first several posts with the gear lists from [Trekking-Lite-Store.com](http://blog.fastpacking.de/wordpress/one-stop-shop-eine-komplette-ul-ausruestung-vom-trekking-lite-store-teil-211/), [Globetrotter](http://blog.fastpacking.de/wordpress/one-stop-shop-eine-komplette-ul-ausruestung-von-globetrotter-frankfurt-teil-3-11/) and [Bergfreunde](http://blog.fastpacking.de/wordpress/one-stop-shop-eine-komplette-ul-ausruestung-von-bergfreunde-de-teil-411/).*
