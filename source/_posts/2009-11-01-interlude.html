<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">I was on a 24 trip this weekend with a French UL backpacker, trip report coming this week. I'm really busy at the moment with a project in Helsinki, doing long hours, which is why replies to comments weren't immediately forth coming, and also reading what my fellow backpack-blogger mates were up to took a backseat as after 10+ h working I was too tired to read what went on. I try to catch up this coming week, and leave you with a early winter impression from my trip.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Y69z9Q0ATE_qdf7eKl3o2Q?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/Su284mWnLQI/AAAAAAAAAwk/CDVxSvncH60/s800/IMG_3165.JPG" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://technorati.com/faves?sub=addfavbtn&amp;add=http://www.hikinginfinland.blogspot.com"><img src="http://static.technorati.com/pix/fave/tech-fav-1.png" alt="Add to Technorati Favorites" /></a></span></div>
