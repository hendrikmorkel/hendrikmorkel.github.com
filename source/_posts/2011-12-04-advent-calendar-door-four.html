In this wet weather it is mighty hard to keep my smartphone dry, let alone taking it out in the rain to write a text to my mate to ask him if he'd fancy a pint - I'm pretty much gave up on on alcohol because of that. Well, with a <a href="http://cascadedesigns.com/en/sealline"target="_blank">SealLine</a> <a href="http://cascadedesigns.com/en/sealline/protective-cases/iseries/product"target="_blank">iSeries case</a> for my phone, that would no longer need to be the case. I could text, tweet and call in a deluge, and would no longer need to worry that I break my smartphone. And if I pick up packrafting in the future, it also would come in handy - there's water everywhere. Anyway, I'd highly appreciate if you'd bring me one this year - see it as an investment, cuz if you don't, next year a new smartphone will be on my wishlist; and we both know that those aren't cheap!<br /><br />Best,<br /><br /><br /><i>- An aspiring UL Backpacker</i><br /><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/RYuWi8JSr_M6Vwe-_5-TEWiBcik-iSu3FtqWq-IAnas?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-JnNmCYM5r7s/TtZVyw-xDVI/AAAAAAAAFms/lOg6jvxuQpc/s640/DSC01588.JPG" height="426" width="640" /></a><br /><br />Leave a comment with the brand of phone you want to put in there. It fits other phones than iPhones, although if they're massive the case will be too small.<br /><br /><b>UPDATE I</b><br /><br /><i>And the winner is</i>... Mikael Lepp√§ - Congratulations!
