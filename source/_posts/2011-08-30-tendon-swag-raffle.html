There shall be swag.<br /><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/xiDZimRKJssEVwbdk32vwjWiupv70N-RGKSfyQFBX78?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-DBAtVX8lb94/Tlz9KNxShII/AAAAAAAAFSc/gi-FfNjf0j4/s640/_DSC2352.jpg" height="525" width="640" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.mytendon.com/"target="_blank">Tendon</a> swag, to be concrete. Tendon, they make those very fine <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2011/08/ultralight-climbing.html"target="_blank">climbing ropes</a> I wrote about last week, and they were kind enough to send me three T-Shirts to raffle off to my awesome readers. As you can see above, three cool shirts, Size M, in a pleasant lime colour with a print on the front and back, wait for a new owner. How do you get one? <br /><br />--> <i>Leave a comment with a photo or a link to a photo of you climbing*.</i><br /><br />That's all. On Sunday <a href="http://www.random.org/"target="_blank">I will consult with Reinhold Messner</a> to discuss who should get the shirts. I send everywhere on this globe, as well to the International Space Station, so everyone may take part. It is of benefit if you're a Size Medium, by the way. I will also throw in some cool stickers to you can plaster your helmet, drinking bottle or bike.<br /><br />---<br /><br /><i>*Indoor, outdoor, bouldering, alpine, free solo, mountaineering are all accepted. Extra creative points for climbing on trees will be considered.</i></div>
