I'm got back late from my backpacking/ packrafting trip yesterday, hence the delay. Expect a trip report if I find the time before heading to Amsterdam and my computer doesn't die on me, until then enjoy these trip reports and other articles.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/k3pTT1reuOqaqpKSiONTyXuaAsOEDbUjS8lvO9CZbwA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TFXEg17LWpI/AAAAAAAAC80/eBvIvtdDvJk/s800/P1020727.JPG" /></a><br /><br />A mix of gear and trip report is <a href="http://lightweightoutdoors.com/?p=1192"target="_blank">Phil's Argos Budget Lightweight Challenge</a>, which I found a good and interesting read. Go and read if you're keen to introduce someone to backpacking and get good gear for decent money!<br /><br />Pig Monkey's <a href="http://pig-monkey.com/2010/07/30/a-tale-of-two-in-the-wild-sky/"target="_blank">Tale of Two in the Wild Sky</a> is a recommended read for all those who enjoy mountains and pretty photos.

I recommend you check it out!<br /><br />Back to Norway where <a href="http://goinglighter.blogspot.com/2010/08/rondane.html"target="_blank">Thomas takes us to Rondane</a> where he spent four days with Anders.
