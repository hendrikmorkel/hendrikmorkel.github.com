Dear Santa,

there's no greater joy than kids. And a healthy and happy child is one that gets to play outdoors with its parents, in every season. While summer is less of a problem for the little ones (just keep them cool, and protected from too much sun) winter can be more difficult, at least here in the northern hemisphere - snow, minus temperatures and wind can make playing outside in these harsh conditions dangerous. Though a happy kid is one that is dressed warm and comfortable to play in the snow, and the [Isbjörn of Sweden](http://www.isbjornofsweden.com) [Winter Jumpsuit Entrant](http://www.isbjornofsweden.com/en/articles/2.17.781/winter-jumpsuit-entrantw-170) is what keeps the little one warm, dry and visible in the short days thanks to the reflectors. It's a durable little suit, with a waterproof-breathable shell and a soft, insulating inside. It comes in four wonderful colours, and would be the perfect suit for my little one, so that I can play outdoors with him!

Happy Family Sunday Greetings, 



*An aspiring UL Backpacker*
