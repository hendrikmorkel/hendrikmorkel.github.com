I found the light side, left behind my Meindl boots and Gregory 80 l backpack, learned about quilts, torso pads, down socks for sleeping and am thinking about getting a packraft. Anyway. To make the switch to ultralight backpacking, the <a href="http://gossamergear.com/packs/murmur-hyperlight-backpack.html"target="_blank">Gossamer Gear Murmur</a> would be awesome. It has a big enough volume to fit all my new lightweight gear, has a nice front mesh pocket, two side pockets and the blue colour means I will always see it easily. In case I have a bit more gear with me - I'm still in transition, after all - the pack can expand the volume a bit with a cinch closure to keep things inside dry.<br /><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/ZegGSWVT3zfvgVz0nZTogGiBcik-iSu3FtqWq-IAnas?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-NRiTKxQr5_0/TtZVnQRwBUI/AAAAAAAAFmM/ZlpMM9HaWoc/s800/DSC01576.jpg" height="800" width="532" /></a><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/PyHGviKV-iVCW6-Ybex3k2iBcik-iSu3FtqWq-IAnas?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-nFkgI-X5XaA/TtZVlh0Gu_I/AAAAAAAAFmI/Pd0M-I7wJ3w/s800/DSC01575.jpg" height="800" width="532" /></a><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/_2cjxGyzWFQjVQnNzwIJLmiBcik-iSu3FtqWq-IAnas?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-L2Wp0xdD2yA/TtZVoqmNILI/AAAAAAAAFmQ/5ZDEhqT6yYQ/s800/DSC01577.jpg" height="532" width="800" /></a><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/6DnsCKOdK3WSmKGUbg87WmiBcik-iSu3FtqWq-IAnas?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-fnVu1LIfKg8/TtZVp-ngnzI/AAAAAAAAFmU/J0zg-BKv-NQ/s800/DSC01578.jpg" height="800" width="532" /></a><br /><br />So, as I said in the video, leave a comment with a photo of your current backpack to enter the raffle for this pack. You have till twelve o'clock Finnish time, and I then will update the post with the winner in the afternoon.<br /><br />Good luck!<br /><br />---<br /><br /><b>UPDATE I</b><br /><br />12 o'clock Finnish time was the time limit, amigos!
