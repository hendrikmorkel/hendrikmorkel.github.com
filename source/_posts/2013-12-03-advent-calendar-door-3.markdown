Dear Santa,

I'm sure you have heard about Titanium. Here's a confession: Ultralight backpackers have an obsession with it. It's light, durable, and we wish that all our gear could be made from it. Titanium rain trousers - Imagine it! But as long as scientific research goes into useless stuff instead of wearable Titanium clothing, we at least are happy that our stoves and pans are from Titanium. [EVERNEW](http://www.evernew.co.jp/) makes arguably the best Titanium pots and pans, and their [ECA-278 Titanium Solo Pot Set](http://www.evernewamerica.com/ECA278.htm) is a dream come true. One 750 ml pot, and one 400 ml cup which also works as a pot, they stack inside each other taking up little space and also hold two small gas cartridges. Perfect for those who cook with [Esbit](http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/05/the-2nd-renaissance-of-esbit.html) or gas. I'd love to cook with this set on the trail, and hope that wearable titanium will become available soon, too.

Sincerely yours,


An aspiring lightpacker
