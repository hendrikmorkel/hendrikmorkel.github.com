<i>Snippets?</i> <br /><br />Yes, Snippets.<br /><br /><i>What are Snippets?</i> <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: orange;">ยน</span><br /><br />Snippets will be short posts, consisting of two paragraphs max, a link, a photo, a quote, or a mix thereof. A Snippet post will be what is too long for Twitter, too short for a proper blog post. Quality is still what drives these, so don't yet unsubscribe - I will limit these Snippet posts, so don't expect five daily updates. Quality over quantity is still my motto, and the thought is to remove unnecessary clutter, simplify and streamline posts to the necessary bits - much like reducing your carried gear to the necessary stuff. Snippets!<br /><br />What content will Snippets contain? Things which are on my mind, breaking news, links to interesting articles I read, and whatever else I stumble across which I think will add value to your reading experience and the worldwide UL community.<br /><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/2aGZsymAO_KSZWJGHse5yjWiupv70N-RGKSfyQFBX78?feat=embedwebsite"><img height="426" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-qh73ikDZ5l0/TkkJ8GCprSI/AAAAAAAAFE8/KnuDpL4NtqQ/s640/_DSC2006.jpg" width="640" /></a><br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: orange;">ยน</span> Those who know John Gruber's excellent <a href="http://daringfireball.net/" target="_blank">Daring Fireball</a> or Marcel Wichmann's <a href="http://uarrr.org/" target="_blank">UARRR.org</a> blog will be familiar with the concept of Snippets.
