As you know by now, I diligently do my research, and found that the <a href="http://www.blackrockgear.com/buy.html"target="_blank">Black Rock Hat</a> from <a href="http://www.blackrockgear.com/"target="_blank">Black Rock Gear</a> is the warmest and lightest hat available for UL backpackers. That's because it is made of a DWR coated ripstop nylon and is filled with 900fp goose down, the lightest and warmest material around. It even has a soft inner headband, which feels great on the skin, and the snug fit means no heat can escape. I would wear it night and day, and make it part of my sleep system. And on trips where I won't need a hat during the day, its tiny packsize means it takes nearly no space in my pack but is there for me when I need it. I'm sure you'd like one as well, maybe ask <a href="http://www.blackrockgear.com/"target="_blank">Black Rock Gear</a> if they make you one in Santa-Red? And did I mention that it is super-ultralight and warm already? <br /><br />Best,<br /><br /><br /><i>- An aspiring UL-Backpacker</i><br /><br /><a href="http://www.blackrockgear.com/"target="_blank"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-6vzPZvmcjTw/TteUYL5UoXI/AAAAAAAAFns/S8gadTuK8Js/s640/BRG-Logo.jpg" height="523" width="640" /></a><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/4cgqaSN5K6hBry5bIqlh52iBcik-iSu3FtqWq-IAnas?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-MV3Yzds4fyk/TtZVuKykrfI/AAAAAAAAFmg/4JeoQvIxv7s/s640/DSC01581.jpg" height="640" width="426" /></a><br /><br />Leave a comment with a mugshot photo in which you hold a piece of paper, stating a spectacular reason why you should win.
