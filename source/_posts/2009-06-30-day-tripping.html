<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">Already a few weekends ago I went with the significant other for a day trip to the forests close to Tampere. We took a bus to the forest, and then walked for about three hours till it started raining and we took a bus back home. We saw plenty of squirrels in the forest, and the ridges and eskers made for a nice walk. I even made us a cup of cacao with the Bush Buddy, and the lady was mighty impressed =) Enjoy some photos of our day out together.<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&current=IMG_3018.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_3018.jpg" border="0" alt="Walking w/ Minna"></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&current=IMG_3025.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_3025.jpg" border="0" alt="Walking w/ Minna"></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&current=IMG_3027.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_3027.jpg" border="0" alt="Walking w/ Minna"></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&current=IMG_3035.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_3035.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&current=IMG_3044.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_3044.jpg" border="0" alt="Walking w/ Minna"></a><br /><br />I was able to convince her to go for an over-nighter with me, and so we will walk a part of the Pirkan Taival trail next week. It needs to be perfect - its her first backpacking trip - so I need to ensure <br /><br />a) great scenery<br />b) easy walking<br />c) sufficient and good food<br />d) beautiful spot for the night<br /><br />and of course good equipment and so on. I probably will give her my Hagl√∂fs Tight Pro with some food and water, while I will carry everything else. I won a <a href="http://www.odoo.tv/Sir-Joseph-Double-Attack.288.0.html">Sir Joseph Double Attack</a> sleeping bag in a blogging contest in March, so we will be using that, coupled together, for sleeping, together with a Evazote and my TAR ProLite 4. Cooking will be with the BBU, and I was thinking of getting some Real Turmat food for the trip, cuz its fast and easy. If you got any tips on how to make the trip a excellent first experience, feel free to share them with me!</span></div>
