It's unmisable turning to the warm-jacket and sleeping bag time of the year.

Sourcing Commitment
As a manufacturer of products which are filled with goose down, we are very concerned for the welfare of all geese that provide the insulation that is ultimately used in our products. The down we purchase does not come from geese that have been live-plucked or subjected to force feeding. We have a unique direct contact in Eastern Europe which sources our plumage from a mother goose farm. This is a location where the geese are raised for breeding as opposed to strictly being raised for poultry. This means that their life span is much longer and they do not live their life in confinement or cages. These geese have relatively little interaction with humans on a day to day basis since the plumage is gathered from their nesting area while the geese are out on other parts of the property. We take the time to visit both the farm and the processor, and have always found the geese to be in good health, with a clean, covered nesting area on a large rural property with a stream and several ponds.



## Bottom line

In the end it is about trust: Do you trust the written words of a company on their website about how they source their down?
