*Its Great Out There* has been my thinking since I started to regularly go outdoors and climb, hike, packraft, cycle or camp. Why I thinks that way you find out in this post!

In last years #MyWeek #BeActive Challenge you got a [permit to get outdoors](https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/08/take-part-in-the-myweek-beactive-challenge.html), and following up on that initiative this year the European Outdoor Group wants you to realize once more that [#ItsGreatOutThere](http://www.itsgreatoutthere.com). If you [follow me on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/hendrikm/) you probably have seen that hashtag quite a bit, because I honestly prefer being outside instead of standing in front of my desk.

The #ItsGreatOutThere campaign's believe - which I fully support - is that outdoor activites have an positive impact on individuals and society as a whole. Fitness, self-confidence, life skills, fun, health, unforgettable memories & a sustainable connection with nature â€“ that is the power of outdoor sports. Add in friends & your family and you will create lasting memories & bonds which you will fondly look back to in old age! I much prefer to spend my time in nature with the family & friends instead of being in a busy city or working at the office. When the latter gets too much I jump on my bike and head out for a ride, coming back feeling much more satisfied and happy.

To help you realize that its better outside (just in case you have forgeotten ;) the European Outdoor Group has partnered with a lot of cool events & companies to offer you some great prizes in their competitions this autumn. First off is the [timeout](http://www.itsgreatoutthere.com/competition01-timeout/) competition where you can win two tickets for the The North Face Mountain Festival as well as some cool outdoor kit which makes autumn adventures warmer & drier. Click that link if you feel like chilling with like-minded folks in Switzerland in the middle of September!

But even if you don't have the desire to go to Switzerland for hiking, camping, climbing and good campfire vibes, you always can use the #ItsGreatOutThere and #beactive hashtags when you're outside. Be it your cycle commute to the office, an after-work run in the forest, a packrafting Microadventure at the weekend or going for a dayhike with the kids. Need some ideas how you can #BeActive? Here you go:

- Explore a Nature trail near where you life
- Go geocaching
- Build a den in the forest with your kids
- Go bouldering

And after that, share your outdoor fun with your friends & followers on Social Media. Don't forget to add the #ItsGreatOutThere and #BeActive hashtags - That's it =) You now have a great permission to get outdoors and a superb excuse, too - in case you need one! Have fun and feel free to share your adventures with us in the comments underneath!
