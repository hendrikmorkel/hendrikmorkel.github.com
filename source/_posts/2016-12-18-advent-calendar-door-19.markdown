Dear Santa,

Quilts are what we ultralight backpackers & climbers love most. Not only are they way lighter than a sleeping bag, but the freedom of movement and ease of use are at least as important. <a href="http://www.enlightenedequipment.com/">Enlightened Equipment</a> makes some of the most innovative <a href="http://www.enlightenedequipment.com/quilts/">quilts</a> on the market, and almost all of their quilts are Made-to-Order exactly like one wants it. Extra down and a slim cut? No problem! Synthetic insulation and a wide foot box? Also no problem! Tim and his employees are able to fulfil almost every wish when it comes to quilts, and once you have slept under an Enlightened Equipment Quilt you won't ever go back to a sleeping bag!
