[Backpackinglight.dk](http://www.backpackinglight.dk/) is another European ultralight shop which specializies in offering lightweight gear from across the world in one stop. As the name implies, they're into ultralight backpacking - so can they take the lead in the [OSS](http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/one-stop-shop/)?

*If you need to freshen up what this is all about, read the [Introduction](http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/one-stop-shop-introduction.html)!*

[Backpackinglight.dk](http://www.backpackinglight.dk/) exists since several years and like the [trekking-lite-store.com](http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/one-stop-shop-trekking-lite-store-dot-com.html) offers European customers easy access to US cottages brands like Hyperlite Mountain Gear and ULA Equipment, besides some great European gear. However, they don't have garments so again some items were included that come from other stores, in that case they're marked with a *.

<br>**Total Weight**: 5.327 g
<br>**Total Price**: 2.584,35 €

My thoughts on the list:

- Great choices for quilt, shelter and pack
- Again a Exped SynMat UL 7, i probably would go for another one
- Sweet stove & pot setup that's very versatile
- Great choices for garments
- Overall a true UL list (although two items are missing) that's under 5 kg, 

The standing thus far:

| [Trekking-Lite-Store.com](http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/one-stop-shop-trekking-lite-store-dot-com.html) | 6.157 g | 2.288,80 € | 0,47 € per gram
| [CampSaver.com](http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/one-stop-shop-campsaver-dot-com.html) | 5.316 g | 1.993,80 € | 0,52 € per gram
| [Globetrotter](http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/one-stop-shop-globetrotter.html) | 8.995 g | 3.272,20 € | 0,36 € per gram
| [Partioaitta](http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/one-stop-shop-partioaitta.html) | 7.354 g | 2448,15 € | 0,33 € per gram
| [Bergfreunde](http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/one-stop-shop-bergfreunde.html) | 4.657 g | 2.440,10 € | 0,52 € per gram
| [Walkonthewildside.eu](http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/one-stop-shop-walkonthewildside.html) | 6.143 g | 2.349,45 € | 0,38 g per gram
| [Backpackinglight.dk]() | 4.994 g | 2.464,35 € | 0,49 € per gram
| **AVERAGE** | 6.230 g | 2.465,26 € | 0,44 € per gram

<br>As you see, those UL lists bring the averages for the weight down, but put the average for money spent a bit up! Interesting to see how things will develop next week, when [Racelite.de](http://www.racelite.de/) and [Ultralight Outdoor Gear](http://www.ultralightoutdoorgear.co.uk/) will show off their lists!

**Disclaimer**: *The [One Stop Shop Series](http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/one-stop-shop/) was [Carsten](http://blog.fastpacking.de/)'s idea and he gave me permission to translate his posts to English and contact a few more shops around the world. If you can read German, you can head over to his blog and read the next posts with the gear lists from [Racelite.de](http://blog.fastpacking.de/wordpress/one-stop-shop-eine-komplette-ausruestung-von-racelite-de-teil-611/).*
