In this article, which is part of the "Women in the Outdoors" week, my fiancée reports on her experiences with the GoLite Cottonwood Racerback Run Tank & Madrone Frontcountry Pant and lets us know what she likes about them, and what not. Very useful for all the boyfriends, fiancés and husbands if you are looking for some outdoor worthy garments for your significant other!<br /><br />The cut of the top is flattering to most bodies. There is an unnoticeable iPod pocket integrated into the shirt, and the top is very comfortable to wear but it doesn't really feel any lighter than other tops. I highly appreciate that this product is mostly made of recycled material - the material feels soft and slightly velvety.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/hpbWMaGb8Bw0JffCY_VM5eQ2kgGUjyrGDanLd1XRaqw?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S-h6Hin26II/AAAAAAAACfw/QYZG3V1vbzA/s800/vaatteita_20100506_0040.jpg" /></a><br /><br />The <a href="http://www.golite.com/Product/ProdDetail.aspx?p=204003110&mc=198&t=&lat=">Cottonwood Racerback Run top</a> is shorter than I would expect, even if my back is not that long. On the other hand it hits exactly the spot where pants normally start and fits well in that sense. When one moves, the hem does not rise though, which is good. The top wouldn't suit women with big breasts; it doesn't give that much support and the shortness of this model would also cause some trouble in that case. <br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Z3BnRCJFetjacok9jFkQkuQ2kgGUjyrGDanLd1XRaqw?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S-h6LysfVeI/AAAAAAAACf0/Owhi5DJ8TWg/s800/vaatteita_20100506_0052.jpg" /></a><br />iPod pocket.<br /><br />The colour of the top is bright and lively, very fresh blue. The support part underneath is white, slightly creamy coloured - I wonder how quickly usage shows in it and how it effects the time this product can be in use. The white part sits still, doesn't move and doesn't show much while wearing the top. Folding the top after wearing / washing turns out to be quite challenging though.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/mECGCFgJwfvwXkodxkT4d-Q2kgGUjyrGDanLd1XRaqw?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S-h6O2kDG2I/AAAAAAAACf8/BQAbczsq65k/s800/vaatteita_20100506_0056.jpg" /></a><br /><br />I chose the <a href="http://www.golite.com/Product/ProdDetail.aspx?p=203004110&mc=196&t=&lat=">Madrone Frontcountry pants</a> in size L since they [the pants] tend to always be too short for me. That was the case with these too, and the waist was too big. The string on the waist keeps them up well, though. The pants come in a beautiful chocolate brown color, but the finishing could be a little more refined, I think - they make the garment look less of good quality which is a shame, because the pants are very well made. Maybe the pockets are there only for the looks? At least I wouldn't find it practical to put stuff in them. Instead of the pockets there could be some other interesting detail.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/kIIEW7BfzvmH7KCHp_r1OeQ2kgGUjyrGDanLd1XRaqw?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S-h5_k3OsEI/AAAAAAAACfg/XiV15OYOq8M/s800/vaatteita_20100506_0012.jpg" /></a><br /><br />The pants are really light, the lightest pants I've ever worn. One can move very freely in them. The fabric is more slippery than the one in the top, which I find nicer. However, I wish more effort would be put into the shape of these pants; they look saggy to me. I also always wish there would be different models and variations for differents body types, since women normally wear tighter clothes and therefore it also makes a big difference if the garment fits or not. Pants should also fit nicely with shoes.<br /><br />The consistency of these clothes is very similar: around 85 % of polyester and 15 % of spandex. Both products can be taken care of at home: gentle wash in cold water. Both products come with a possibility to send them back after use and be recycled, which I like.</div>
