<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"><a href="https://www.smartwool.com">Smartwool</a> scored high in my article about <a href="http://hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/2009/09/environmental-performance-of-outdoor.html">environmental performance</a>, and the company also makes some very comfy, warm and good looking merino baselayer garments. I will introduce you today to two garments out of their Microweight Series: The <a href="https://www.smartwool.com/#/Mens/Apparel/Baselayer/Microweight/2026/">M's Microweight Zip T</a> and the <a href="https://www.smartwool.com/#/Mens/Apparel/Baselayer/Microweight/2514/">M's Microweight Bottom</a>.<br /><br />Lets start with the top. If you're living on the Northern half of this planet, then its now slowly that time of the year where leaves turn yellow, red and brown and fall from the trees. That means for me its time to get the baselayer out of the closet. However, its not yet so cold as that a heavy layer is needed, and so the Smartwool Microlight Zip T is what I take. The Zip allows me a good possibility to ventilate, and if its one of those windy days or cold nights, then there's nothing better than zipping it up to the top and feeling toasty.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/RbbYxyILnV3D1vr1raPVTQ?authkey=Gv1sRgCL3Nwfysn8rjKQ&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/SsEDvXTgdUI/AAAAAAAAAjo/tfRxAfOkdIA/s800/IMG_2105.JPG" /></a><br />Great ventilation for on the go.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Anhq8sjSvtOg-tKrTynD9g?authkey=Gv1sRgCL3Nwfysn8rjKQ&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/SsED8pr7-WI/AAAAAAAAAjs/dYEizwwjogA/s800/IMG_2137.JPG" /></a><br />Zipped up for the break.<br /><br />The Zip T weights 196 g in Size M and works great on its own. With my <a href="http://hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/2009/08/gear-talk-rab-microlite-vest.html">Rab Microlite Vest</a> its very warm for the breaks and nights, and the merino wool keeps what it promises: After a weekend out I came home and asked my girlfriend to have a sniff, and lo and behold, she didn't find me smelly at all! The quality it top, and I very much like the colour, Willow is what the guys from Smartwool call it (I would say olive).<br /><br />The bottoms are of the same high quality, and weigh 154 g (Size M) on my scale. They got a fly, which is pretty handy because so you don't need to pull your complete underwear down if you heed natures call, giving the last surviving mosquitos no chance to bite you in your bottoms. The fly is a tunnel system which works well. The waistband is perfect, it doesn't push but sits comfortably on my waist without falling down. <br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Qd8U8IvV4WRofor2Hp-v4A?authkey=Gv1sRgCL3Nwfysn8rjKQ&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/SsIa5znYybI/AAAAAAAAAkg/E3lcyKEOxxc/s800/IMG_2218.JPG" /></a><br />Warm, zipper, flat seams and light.<br /><br />I've been wearing the Zip T and the bottoms already a lot in the past weeks, and they will see more action in the next months. I also will use them in everyday life, as they are so thin and light that they are perfect for under my jeans and shirt in the winter (we have about -15°C minimum at daytime in the winter where I life, and with the wind it often feels like -30°C = you need to wear long underwear). On the last few trips I have been wearing the longsleeve and the bottoms, and they performed admirably.<br /><br />In Finland you can get Smartwool garments at <a href="http://www.partioaitta.fi/">Partioaitta</a> and <a href="http://www.partiovaruste.fi/">Partiovaruste</a>.
