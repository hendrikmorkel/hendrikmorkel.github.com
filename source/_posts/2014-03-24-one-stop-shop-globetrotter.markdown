On our third [One Stop Shop](http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/one-stop-shop/) stop we visit [Globetrotter](https://www.globetrotter.de/?utm_source=PTID13002584) and see if Germany's best known Online + Brick & Mortar Store can take the lead in a lightweight and affordable ultralight gear list at one stop!

[Globetrotter](https://www.globetrotter.de/?utm_source=PTID13002584) is a well-known outdoor shop chain in Germany, and if you ever visit one of the cities where they have a shop presence, you're doing well in paying them a visit: They are nicely decorated and some stores offer cold rooms to check out down jackets at -25°C, while in other you can go for a paddle on the indoor lake. Usually not known for light gear, a group of employees from the Store in Frankfurt set out to design a lightweight One Stop Shop list nevertheless. Will they succeed? Lets see:

<br>**Total Weight**: 8995 g
<br>**Total Price**: 3.272,20 €

My thoughts on the list:

- WOW. That's pretty heavy and expensive, and while using a lot of good gear it's in my opinion a bit over-built for our guidelines
- A 70 l backpack that's over 2 kg :( That's a big fail for the first pick
- While WM sleeping bags are superb - the Antelope is overkill for our guidelines
- There are lighter and cheaper tents than the Akto, which itself is a 4-season shelter, too
- I don't understand why they include two pots and two pans - one of each is enough
- What's the obsession with Mids for hiking? 
- Good choices for garments, though again I feel it was more aimed at a price as high as possible instead of as lightweight as possible
- Overall I really feel here light weight comes at a too high cost - one could achieve a lower weight and pay less if better choices would have been made

[Read the comments and discussion on the German post](http://blog.fastpacking.de/wordpress/one-stop-shop-eine-komplette-ul-ausruestung-von-globetrotter-frankfurt-teil-3-11/), where for example a lighter and cheaper list has been made.

The standing thus far:

| [Trekking-Lite-Store.com](http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/one-stop-shop-trekking-lite-store-dot-com.html) | 6157 g | 2.288,80 € | 0,47 € per gram
| [CampSaver.com](http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/one-stop-shop-campsaver-dot-com.html) | 5316 g | 1.993,80 € | 0,52 € per gram
| [Globetrotter]() | 8995 g | 3.272,20 € | 0,36 € per gram

<br>Next up is [Partioaitta](http://www.partioaitta.fi/Etusivu). Can Finland's largest Outdoor Store go lighter than their competitor from Germany?

**Disclaimer**: *The [One Stop Shop Series](http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/one-stop-shop/) was [Carsten](http://blog.fastpacking.de/)'s idea and he gave me permission to translate his posts to English and contact a few more shops around the world. If you can read German, you can head over to his blog and read already the first posts with the gear lists from [Bergfreunde](http://blog.fastpacking.de/wordpress/one-stop-shop-eine-komplette-ul-ausruestung-von-bergfreunde-de-teil-411/) and [Walkonthewildside.de](http://blog.fastpacking.de/wordpress/one-stop-shop-eine-komplette-ul-ausruestung-von-walkonthewildside-de-teil-511/).*
