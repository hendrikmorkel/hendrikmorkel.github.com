Dear Santa,

a warm head and warm feet are essential when backpacking. Rain, snow and wind can easily get in the way there, cooling down your toes and cheeks that it ain't fun anymore. So to keep warm I ponder if today I should rather get a pair of [GooseFeet Gear Down Socks](https://goosefeetgear.com/products/1-down-socks) or a [GooseFeet Gear Down Hood](https://goosefeetgear.com/products) to keep at least one of the two sufficiently warm. Both are hand-made of the lightest outer materials and the warmest down, a true Ultralighters dream. Well, at least you know now, and I'm looking forward to see which you'll pick for me.

Happy trails,


*An aspiring UL Backpacker*
