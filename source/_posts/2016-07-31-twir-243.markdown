The [PHD Minimus tops](http://www.phdesigns.co.uk/sales-and-special-offers) are now lighter and more fully featured. 

Have a tear in your favourite jacket? That new backpack has a small cut? Then get the awesome [Noso Patch](http://bit.ly/2arA5Lv) which fixes your kit in seconds, all without ironing or sewing!

Nom nom, that's tasty: The new [Wild Lummi Island Pink Salmon](http://bit.ly/2amzQqw) from Patagonia Provisions is wild pink salmon, sourced only from abundant, thriving runs. Sustainable backpacking food at its best!

[BMC to change its name to Climb Britain](https://www.thebmc.co.uk/bmc-to-change-its-name-to-climb-britain). As a climber I like it, as a hillwalker, backpacker and hiker I find that questionable.

[Save 30% and more on your favourite gear from Patagonia](http://bit.ly/2anRGq6)!
