Located at the foot of the Alps in Garmisch-Partenkirchen [Racelite.de](http://www.racelite.de/)  has its website and Brick & Mortar shop open since 2005. Robert Pohlhammer is certainly a well-known name in Germany and beyond, as he is the organizer of the [Yukon Arctic Ultra](http://www.arcticultra.de/en/) and the [Trail Days](http://www.traildays.de/). This is reflected also in part in his list:

[See the German Version](http://blog.fastpacking.de/wordpress/one-stop-shop-eine-komplette-ausruestung-von-racelite-de-teil-611/) which also includes a water filter.

My thoughts on the list:

- Great sleeping system combo
- A bit heavy choice for the backpack, but it's pretty high volume
- Nice shelter choice, though I'd have liked to see a tarp again
- Now that stove & pot combo is interesting, versatile as it can use Esbit, wood or alcohol as fuel and packs very compact
- Interesting shoe choice, never heard of the brand before but seems like a good shoe
- Excellent choices for garments!
- Again a very well-rounded list that's pretty affordable - the cheapest European list thus far!
