It has a high breaking load capacity while being very light, and its nice colour also means it is easy to see in case it drops on the forest floor or when rock climbing. If you would drop a few in my stockings, I will make sure that a nice apple pie is waiting for you next year!<br /><br />Best,<br /><br /><br /><i>- An aspiring UL-Backpacker</i><br /><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/KNbg2i_W80Js-wd_qcZRXGiBcik-iSu3FtqWq-IAnas?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-h4ejLsw3Vzk/TuTxVzvvw0I/AAAAAAAAFo0/8NGt0KrKIuc/s640/DSC01616.jpg" height="640" width="426" /></a><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/VHHiaehlyJYERH7o_9-icGiBcik-iSu3FtqWq-IAnas?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Ce1EsaGixHY/TuTxXFtqjNI/AAAAAAAAFo4/P2BbiBgByac/s640/DSC01617.JPG" height="426" width="640" /></a><br /><br />Leave a comment and tell for what you're going to use these carabiners - you got till 18 o'clock!<br /><br /><b>UPDATE I</b><br /><br /><i>And the winner is</i>...
