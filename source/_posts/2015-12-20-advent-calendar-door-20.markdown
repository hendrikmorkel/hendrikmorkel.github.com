Dear Santa,

It might be winter, but that doesn't mean I can't think ahead for spring, summer and autumn when lighter kit will be the norm. Kit like the [Jacks 'R' Better](http://www.jacksrbetter.com/) [Sierra Stealth Quilt](http://www.jacksrbetter.com/shop/sierra-stealth/), which is filled with high-quality 800 cuin hydrophobic Activ-dri down™ and weighs a mere 470 g! It's a quilt which means it's super-easy to get under, ventilate - and the best thing: Thanks to the head hole it doubles as a sarape at camp, allowing me to leave a down jacket at home! It's also useful when getting up in the morning is difficult - just slip the head through the hole and you can wear this toasty warm quilt while waiting for the coffee and Müsli to be ready. While on the trail it packs down to the size of a grapefruit and so fits even into the smallest daypack!
