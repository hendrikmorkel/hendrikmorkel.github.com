Dear Santa,

I reckon you do get around a bit when delivering presents around the globe. I always have wondered how it must be to celebrate the holidays in shorts at the beach, with the temperature being +30°C instead of -30°C. And if you're in Australia already, you should stop by and visit [Terra Rosa Gear](http://www.terrarosagear.com/) one of Downunder's finest lightweight gear purveyors! They make some pretty swell [tarp](http://www.terrarosagear.com/tarpshelters.htm), and I think even you would like a red [Silnylon Wandering Tarp](http://www.terrarosagear.com/tarpshelters.htm)! This versatile, 290 g light shelter has eight tie-out points and can be pitched in multiple ways - Diamond, A-Frame, Flat, or or or! It also packs nicely small in the pack, but can offer a couple of people protection from rain and wind. 

Sincerely yours,


An aspiring lightpacker
