Dear readers,<br /><br />my announcement yesterday, in case its <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/search/label/moving%20forward%20into%20April"target="_blank">label</a>, the date it was published and <a href="http://www.briangreen.net/2012/04/scandinavia-bound-goodbye-usa.html"target="_blank">Brian's sudden move to Finland</a> didn't tip you off: It all was an elaborate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fools'_Day"target="_blank">April's Fool Day</a> joke, in cooperation with Brian Green of <s>Backpacking in Finland</s> <a href="http://www.briangreen.net/"target="_blank">Brian's Backpacking Blog</a>. We both set out to fool you and bring a bit of humour back into the outdoor blog sphere, and hope you had a good laugh and a good start into April!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/5768271698/" title="Camp at Otroskoski by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2739/5768271698_309c5fc7bf_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Camp at Otroskoski"></a><br /><br /></div>
