Dear Santa,

The [Primaloft Bomber Pile](http://rojksuperwear.com/en/chicks/chicks-primaloft-bomberpile-tamarillo.html) jacket from [Röjk](http://rojksuperwear.com/en/) is the kind of Midlayer that looks great on the way to the office and shows its functionality when you're hitting the slopes. Made in Europe from the unique PrimaLoft Polyester this piece is so fluffy and warm that cold temperatures won't stop you from enjoying your favourite winter sports, while wicking away sweat to keep you feelin' dry & toasty. The fluffy outside makes you look a wee bit like Chewbacca, which never is a bad thing, and thumbloops as well as smartly placed pockets keep drafts out and important items close by. A functional piece that's great under your hardshell when you go down pillows of Pow and & stylish if you enjoy a hot cup of Minttukakao afterwards.
