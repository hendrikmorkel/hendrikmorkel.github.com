Together, they asked owners of fleece and Gore-Tex everywhere to pledge to <b>reduce</b> consumption, <b>reuse</b> old gear, <b>recycle</b>, <b>repair</b> what's broken, and <b>reimagine</b> a world where people don't stress the earth with purchases.</i> &nbsp;- <a href="http://www.outsideonline.com/blog/patagonia-ebay-sign-the-pledge-then-sell-your-old-stand-up-shorts.html%22target=%22_blank">Source</a></blockquote><br />If you know me a bit, then you know that I value sustainability. You also might be aware that I value a few outdoor companies who do so as well. So as I read this news, and checked out the <a href="http://campaigns.ebay.com/patagonia/join/"target="_blank">Patagonia Common Threads Initiative page</a> I didn't think long to make the pledge. And with the pretty good selection of <a href="http://www.patagonia.com/us/ebay/used-gear#"target="_blank">used Patagonia gear</a> up for grabs I also am tempted to make a purchase or two (am still looking for a comfy climbing pants). If you need a new baselayer, a puffy jacket or a shell, check out the selection and buy it there instead of getting it new. Your children, grandchildren and nature will thank you. <br /><br />I, personally, applaud Patagonia for making this step - it is the ultimate commitment for a better future, against the bottom line. Respect.</div>
