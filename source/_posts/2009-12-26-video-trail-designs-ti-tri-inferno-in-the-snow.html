<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">My <a href="http://hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/2009/09/gear-talk-trail-designs-ti-tri-inferno.html">second video</a> of the <a href="http://traildesigns.com/">Trail Designs</a> Ti-Tri Inferno wood burning stove, this time in winter conditions. Temperature outside was -12Â°C and it was windy, however, I was able to use dry wood from the shed, which made all the difference in comparison to the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/2009/12/video-bushcooker-lt-ii-in-winter.html">Bushcooker LT II</a> where I used wood from the forest, which was moist and icy. The dry wood and good kindling made all the difference, and the Inferno once more lived up to its name.<br /><br /><object width="640" height="505"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/pJuA7b9GqME&hl=en_US&fs=1&color1=0x234900&color2=0x4e9e00"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/pJuA7b9GqME&hl=en_US&fs=1&color1=0x234900&color2=0x4e9e00" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="505"></embed></object><br /><br />Trail weight of the Inferno is 232 g and that includes the Caldera Cone, Inferno insert, Fireplate, Titanium stakes and the caddy - however, this does depend on which pot you use, and as I have a big pot the weight is a bit heavier than if you have a smaller pot. Its more heavy as the Bushcooker LT II, and also is a lot more hungry, i. e. it needs a lot of wood. However, I reckon that once you have it going the wood can be icy or moist and the Inferno will still work fine, as it has a lot of power. The time of boiling a cup of snow (that's a Tibetan Titanium 1100 pot, in case you're wondering, and weights 141 g including the lid) is really fantastic, as you can hear in the video, I'm rather excited about it! That leaves the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/2009/05/gear-test-bushbuddy-ultra-tibetian.html">BushBuddy Ultra</a> for a winter test, and I guess Sunday or Monday could see it coming =)</span></div>
