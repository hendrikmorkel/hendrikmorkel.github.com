It's prime backpacking season right now, late summer/ early autumn, the mosquitos and horseflies are largely gone and you can't imagine something better than pitching your tent at the beach, at the lake or on that beautiful ridge to take in the view and let your mind drift. But then a thought pops into your mind: *Is wild camping allowed here?*

I can not imagine many things better than a wild camp high up on a mountain. By a lake. At the shore of the ocean. On a wild island. Just me, my tarp or shelter, wind, sun, stars. And here in the north we're blessed with the Everyman's Right, which allows us to go pretty much everywhere and pitch out tent. But not every country in Europe is as open-minded as the Nordic countries, and pitching your tent on wild land can land you a hefty fine if you're caught. But then these countries are densely populated and wild land is not as common as in Norway, Sweden or Finland.

## Law versus practice
As I have been fortunate enough these past years to travel a bit in Europe I am always curious to find out if it is OK to pitch my tarp or tent in the hills and forests. The laws of a country are often different than the situation on the ground, and where there is no judge there's seldom an executioner. One of the biggest differences in most countries is between pitching a tent/ tarp or sleeping in a bivy. If you pitch a pitch a *tarp, tent or shelter* you usually are considered to be **camping** whereas if you're laying in a *bivy* you're considered to be **bivvying**. The latter is often tolerated as it's seen as leaving no (visual) impacts during and after the night out, whereas a tent, as pretty as it might be, well, is a tent that you can see from far away. If you need to read up on bivies I can recommend [The Book of the Bivvy](http://amzn.to/1pUOMun), after that wee book you're enlightened to the art and will be ready to sleep in one. 

Common sense also dictates that if you want to sleep out but don't want to break the law, and definitely don't want to get a fine, you could ask land owners if you may pitch your tarp on their field. If they're running a business it can create goodwill if you purchase some of their goods - farmers are an excellent choice for these circumstances: Buy some milk or cheese and then ask if you may pitch your tarp up on their field.
