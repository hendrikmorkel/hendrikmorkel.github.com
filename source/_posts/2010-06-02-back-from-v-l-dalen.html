It was an epic trip, and the reports will follow during the following weeks - keep your eyes on the blogs of <a href="http://www.nielsenbrownoutdoors.com/">Roger</a>, <a href="http://thebearablelightness.blogspot.com/">Gustav</a>, <a href="http://www.fjaderlatt.se/">Jörgen & Martin</a> and <a href="http://thunderinthenight.blogspot.com/">Joe</a>. Until my trip report of "The UL Fellowship" will come, I leave you with this impression of the Fellowship crossing into the lands of Morder, ähm, the Swedish Fjell.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Xqf7RvGwYOLttP3BrbRl6eEQ03jDDmZnzakDs5ohGsQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TAUqwr__mlI/AAAAAAAACpY/RadGtu1GGxo/s800/_MG_7435.jpg" /></a></div>
