<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">And the final test of a wood burning stove in winter conditions, this time the <a href="http://bushbuddy.ca">BushBuddy Ultra</a> - my first wood burning stove - enters the fray. Conditions were similar to the previous tests, the temperatures were -12Â°C and it was snowing and windy. <br /><br /><object width="640" height="505"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/uVPYV2_13Cs&hl=en_US&fs=1&color1=0x234900&color2=0x4e9e00"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/uVPYV2_13Cs&hl=en_US&fs=1&color1=0x234900&color2=0x4e9e00" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="505"></embed></object><br /><br />My <a href="http://hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/2009/05/gear-talk-bushbuddy-ultra-tibetian.html">BushBuddy Ultra</a> weights 134 g, and the TT 1100 pot it can be nestled in is 141 g including the lid, plus the orange packsack which is 18 g, all together a mere 293 g. However, in comparison to the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/2009/12/video-trail-designs-ti-tri-inferno-in.html">Ti-Tri Inferno</a> and the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/2009/12/video-bushcooker-lt-ii-in-winter.html">Bushcooker LT II</a> the BushBuddy only can burn wood, whereas the other two can burn alcohol and Esbit. With my <a href="http://hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/2009/08/myog-meth-stove.html">6 g MYOG Top Burner stove</a> I have a good back-up, though, and the Ti-Tri Gram Cracker should also work just fine with it. <br /><br />What I like is that it fits into the pot, is small in size and thus doesn't use a lot of space. The Inferno is great, though I really dislike needing to carry the caddy. Good thing that a smaller Inferno is available nowadays, one which fits into the pot, <a href="http://www.nielsenbrownoutdoors.com/2009/11/compact-ti-tri-caldera-inferno.html">as Roger showed</a>. Anyhow. That should be it with testing wood burning stoves in the snow for a while, maybe that I revisit the Bushcooker LT II and use proper dry wood for a test, but that won't be too soon as I don't have it with me here in Vaasa. I hope you found this interesting and educating, and that it shows that given good fuel using a wood burning stove can be a real alternative for melting and boiling snow/ water in the winter.</span></div>
