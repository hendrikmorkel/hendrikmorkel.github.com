[Outdoorline.sk](http://www.outdoorline.sk/en/) is a dedicated lightweight gear webshop from Slovakia. Located in the foot hills of the Tatras the owner Peter knows that going light in the mountains is a smart choice, and their OSS gear list reflects that.

As a consumer I really think it is awesome that more and more dedicated lightweight webshops like [Outdoorline.sk](http://www.outdoorline.sk/en/) open everywhere across Europe, making it for locals from near and far easy to buy top-notch gear. You can get some of the hard-to-get-in-Europe brands like Westcomb from Outdoorline.sk, and they also have a very good selection of great European brands like Röjk, Crux, Lightwave and Woolpower. But lets have a look what their OSS list looks like:

My thoughts on the list:

- As the series goes on we see more and more seriously lightweight lists - this one is no exception. Even better, it's also very close to the 2.000 € mark 
- A comfy bed, a large backpack and an interesting choice for a shelter
- Cool, lightweight stove! 
- Nice cutlery, knife and headlamp
- Great selection of high-quality garments
- Overall it is great to see such an affordable, lightweight list! If you get a tarp instead of the bivy you could likely push the weight under 5 kg and the cost under 2k!
