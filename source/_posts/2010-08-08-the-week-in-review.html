While I enjoy good food and beer, seeing my family and relatives in Amsterdam, a lot happens in the outdoor scene. Here's a look at especially noteworthy stuff - and in case you find something that'esequally excellent, leave a comment with a link!<br /><br /><object width="640" height="505"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/1Rx-hYjBpMg&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?rel=0&amp;color1=0xe1600f&amp;color2=0xfebd01"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/1Rx-hYjBpMg&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?rel=0&amp;color1=0xe1600f&amp;color2=0xfebd01" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="505"></embed></object><br /><br />Some great trips were made last weekend. Some spectacular photos can been seen on <a href="http://www.mungosaysbah.com/2010/08/photos-from-matts-algonquin-trip-july.html"target="_blank">Mungo Says Bah's Algonquin Provincial Park solo canoe trip</a>.
