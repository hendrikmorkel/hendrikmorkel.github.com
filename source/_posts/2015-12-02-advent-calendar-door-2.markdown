Dear Santa,

watching the sun rise in the mountains - is there anything better? Not really. With the new [Daybreak Pack](http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&mi=13582&pw=73183&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hyperlitemountaingear.com%2Ffeatured-ultralight-packs%2Fdaybreak-pack.html) from [Hyperlite Mountain Gear](http://bit.ly/1QQRFL2) I always have all I need along for a day in the hills. It has side pockets for my water bottles, the possibility to attach an ice axe and a back pocket with additional bungees to easily access rain gear or a puffy jacket. Made from DyneemaÂ® Cuben Fiber it takes the abuse of scrambling in the mountains and bushwhacking through the forests, and at 539 g it is so light you can carry it all day long. And if you consider that it's made in Maine, USA, you know it is a quality piece of gear that is gonna last many, many years!
