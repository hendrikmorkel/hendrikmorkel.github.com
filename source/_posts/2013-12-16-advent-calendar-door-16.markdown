Dear Santa,

With all that down for feet, hands, head and torso, you realize what's missing is something downy to lay under during the night. [The two Jacks](http://hikinginfinland.com/2010/01/interview-jack-tier-jack-myers-of-jacks-r-better.html) from [Jacks ‘R’ Better](http://www.jacksrbetter.com/) make some top-notch quilts since 2004. Their [Sierra Stealth](http://www.jacksrbetter.com/shop/sierra-stealth/) is a versatile quilt: It has a hydrophobic down treatment that keeps the down drier, it can be worn as a serape at camp, and yes, also as a quilt it performs superb. The tapered design - wider at the shoulders - narrower at the feet makes for a body-hugging fit which keeps one warm at night. It's perfect as a summer quilt, but with some down clothing should be good also in spring and autumn. And as it packs to the size of a small melon I'm sure it will fit into my lightly packed backpack!

Sincerely yours,


An aspiring lightpacker
