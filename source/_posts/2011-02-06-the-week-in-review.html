Don't look for self-proclaimed "experts" which fiddle around in their backyard (the only backyard fiddling I approve of is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/shugemery"target="_blank">Shug's</a>!). Learn from folks like Johan, who show you <a href="http://bloggen.nordicbushcraft.com/?p=189"target="_blank">how to light a fire on snow</a>.<br /><br />Another real expert whom you should listen to is Chris Townsend.
