Dear Santa,

It's the 2nd of December and I can not make up my mind - maybe you can help me? I'm unsure what's more important: Warm feet or a warm head. I reckon if I'd have a fluffy beard like you, Santa, the choice would be for the [GooseFeet Gear](https://goosefeetgear.com/) [Down Socks](https://goosefeetgear.com/products/1-down-socks) as the beard helps to keep you warm. But then I don't have such a warm beard, and hence I'm thinking a [Down Balaclava](https://goosefeetgear.com/products/8-down-balaclava) might make more sense for me - after all, the thinking is done in the head, and a warm head thinks better. So the question is: A warm head or warm feet, what do you think is better?

Sincerely yours,


An aspiring lightpacker
