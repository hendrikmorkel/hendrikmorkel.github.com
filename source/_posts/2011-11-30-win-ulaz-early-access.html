You have till tomorrow morning (Thursday morning) to leave a comment with what you think each letter will be about. Those two, who have the most right answers, get on the Email list on which the weekly updates of the series will be distributed - so you will be able to see ULAZ over a month before the series goes life for the general public in January 2012. Please make an easy to read list, with a separate line for each letter, sometihing like this:<br /><br />A - Alcohol Stoves<br />B - ...<br />C - ...<br /><br />And so on. I reckon you would prefer to riddle over the ultralight alphabet instead of doing work ;) <br /><br /><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;">Disclaimer: No cheating, so don't go around asking backers. Otherwise I don't know what else to write in this disclaimer, though it is mighty fine to have one here, just in case, don't you think?</span></i></div>
