An exciting week it was. My <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/08/week-one-at-wilderness-guide-school.html"target=_"blank">first week at the Wilderness Guide School</a> was excellent though very, very busy. But there happened a lot more as well, so click play and start to read!<br /><br /><object width="853" height="505"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/ebZ3ekFBMzU?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0xe1600f&amp;color2=0xfebd01&amp;hd=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/ebZ3ekFBMzU?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0xe1600f&amp;color2=0xfebd01&amp;hd=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="853" height="505"></embed></object><br /><br />Caro "walked" the <a href="http://www.cathohi.de/home/2010/08/fjallraven-classics-in-unter-24-stunden"Target=_"blank">Fjällräven Classics in less than 24 hours</a>, while her partner <a href="http://www.cathohi.de/home/2010/08/thomas-und-sein-kampf-fjallraven-classics-2010"target=_"blank">Thomas did it in a little more time</a>. Both are very interesting trip reports of probably one of the most popular mass backpacking events, so if the Fjällräven Classic is on your list check these two reports out.<br /><br />Chris' report of <a href="http://letsgetoutdoors.blogspot.com/2010/08/what-did-you-do-this-summer.html"target=_"blank">what he did last summer</a> was a very nice read, and if you plan to take part in one of the <a href="http://www.backpackinglight.com/cgi-bin/backpackinglight/wilderness_trekking.html"target=_"blank">BPL WTS courses</a> I recommend that you read this article.<br /><br />Geoff went on a <a href="http://v-g.me.uk/Trips/G0075/G0075.htm"target=_"blank">2-day circuit of the Northern Hirnant</a>.<br /><br />Dave delivered the next installment of his <a href="http://armchair-adventurer.blogspot.com/2010/08/walking-dogs-seiland-44-68hrs.html"target=_"blank">walk with the dogs on Seiland</a>.<br /><br />Cedar & Sands takes us on a <a href="http://cedarandsand.blogspot.com/2010/08/scout-campout-in-boulders.html"target=_"blank">Scout Campout in the Boulders</a> in Utah, and as you might know: I never get tired of viewing that exquisite scenery.<br /><br />Richard went on a <a href="http://maceachain.blogspot.com/2010/08/wildcamp-in-antrim-hills.html"target=_"blank">wildcamping trip in the Antrim Hills</a>, and I feel partially responsible for this trip, so I recommend you go over and see how it turned out!<br /><br />Heber's <a href="http://heberhiking.blogspot.com/2010/08/missouri-hiking-gems.html"target=_"blank">Missouri Hiking Gems</a> article is a worth a look if you life or will be travelling there.<br /><br />Yeti, a fellow Finn who rides his bike with lightweight gear, went on his <a href="http://yetirides.blogspot.com/2010/08/last-summer-overnighter.html"target=_"blank">last summer overnighter</a>. Beautiful photos and lots of kilometers being covered, travelling lightweight by bike is definitely something I will try out.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/JAFIxY9lKGnObZ7ZQHTJ9uxfz4Q8H3PUxNRZtxxeyag?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TG_a-HByDcI/AAAAAAAADIQ/lXKEcTIcZwg/s800/P1030163.JPG" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://bobinson.wordpress.com/2010/08/17/phd-factory-visit/"target=_"blank">Phil from Fat & SH1TE visited the PHD Factory</a> as did <a href="http://www.petesy.co.uk/phd-factory-visit/"target=_"blank">PTC</a> - both super interesting reports which show what goes into making awesome down gear.<br /><br />Darren illuminates us about what the next lightweight metal in the outdoors could be - <a href="http://whitespider1066.com/2010/08/liquidmetal/"target=_"Blank">liquid metal</a>.<br /><br />The Japanese ulgear blog takes a <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&u=http://ulgstore.exblog.jp/13776412/"target=_"blank">first look at the ULA Camino</a>, a front loading UL backpack.<br /><br />Matthias shows off his new <a href="http://uloutdoors.wordpress.com/2010/08/16/mld-cuben-solo-pro-tarp/"target=_"blank">MLD Cuben Solo Pro tarp</a>, a 148 g tarp for the UL enthusiast.<br /><br />Also from MLD, Mark gives us a first look at his new <a href="http://backpackingnorth.blogspot.com/2010/08/first-impressions-mld-burn.html"target=_"blank">MLD Burn backpack</a>.
