Dear Santa,

I'm so happy with my [Sony A7r](http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/10/sony-a7r-field-report.html) that I really never, ever want to drop it. As I'm already a very happy [Peak Design Capture PRO Camera Clip](http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/01/peak-design-capture-pro-camera-clip.html) user, the thought was near to see what they might have in store for me. And [Peak Design](https://peakdesign.com/store/?coupon_code=hikeinfin) didn't disappoint. The [Clutch](https://peakdesign.com/store/clutch/?coupon_code=hikeinfin) is a quick-connecting & quick-adjusting camera hand strap that's inspired by climbing gear - so is sure to last and keep my camera safely on my wrist when I'm shooting. It's 45 g light and is even tripod compatible, and also works with the Capture® Camera Clip.

The [Slide](https://peakdesign.com/store/slide/?coupon_code=hikeinfin) then is a bit heavier at 171 g but is a really versatile camera sling - you can use it as a neck or shoulder strap or, as the name suggests, a slide. It works with any camera, is also tripod and Capture® Camera Clip compatible and being made from 45mm tubular seatbelt-style webbing with internal padding it's comfy around the neck and will catch even a heavy DSLR Setup if dropped by accident! Add in that both these items have a Lifetime warranty on all parts and you can be sure that you only will bring me one, ever!

Sincerely yours,


The Ultralighter
