<STRIKE>I'm off to Scotland tonight.</STRIKE> <span style="font-weight:bold;">Edit</span>: My flight got cancelled due to the heavy snowfall in Edinburgh. The option I had was to fly to London on Monday, but there's no flights to Edinburgh or Glasgow that day, so my wee trip to meet Steven, Johnny, Peter and Phil are off. I'm pretty bummed :(<br /><br /><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/16580852?byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ff9933" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">News & Various:</span><br /><br />You know what is so awesome about UL backpacking?
