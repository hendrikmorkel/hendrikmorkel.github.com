Well, I got hit. Or tagged, as ya say in English. [outdoor-logs.de](http://www.outdoor-logs.de/) threw me a [Blogstöckchen](http://www.outdoor-logs.de/capture-the-colour-und-ein-blogstoeckchen/), said "Hurry up" and then went trailrunning, leaving me sitting with that ticking bomb on my lap. Well, I better hurry up, right?

So, what's this all about? [Capture the colour](http://www.travelsupermarket.com/c/holidays/capture-the-colour/#enter){:rel=nofollow} is a competition in which you need to show off your own photos which fit to the five colours white, yellow, blue, green and red. I guess it's just fortunate that I have a massive collection to choose from, otherwise I'd reaaaaallllly be in a hurry. So, here we go.

## Yellow

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9763145235/" title="Mountain Laurel Designs TrailStar by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3700/9763145235_51b887b518_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Mountain Laurel Designs TrailStar"></a>

This one was easy. It's double yellow - a yellow TrailStar, pitched amongst autumn yellow birch trees. The fog gives it a magical feeling, and the slight unsharpness of the background gives it that mystical morning feel.

## Red

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9562507184/" title="071913_9954 by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3677/9562507184_6b435e67cc_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="071913_9954"></a>

I probably spent five minutes getting the right angle on this plant, which was in the middle of a vast open mire. Balancing on a duck board, my client already far ahead, I tried again and again for the right angle, sharpness, and reflexion. The result is above, and I'm pretty satisfied with it.

## Green

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9362400047/" title="Up there? by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7321/9362400047_eaee21dd2c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Up there?"></a>

Green, that's the colour of grass for me. And a green alpine pasture - up [on the top we met sheep](http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/07/sul-in-the-swiss-alps.html) - like this one was just what came to my mind when I think about green.

## White

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/8595259123/" title="Snow-Rock by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8106/8595259123_087715336e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Snow-Rock"></a>

A photo I shot last March up in Lapland while I was [ice climbing](http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/03/ice-climbing-in-korouoma.html). On the way back to camp I saw this beautiful snow structure atop a rock, and the contrast was just too good to pass up. I love the detail of the snow crystals in the middle, and the soft look of the snow on the right.

## Blue

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7807588712/" title="You can't climb mountains in trailrunners by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7131/7807588712_df00e66139_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="You can't climb mountains in trailrunners"></a>

Blue skies. On the [UL Summit](http://hikinginfinland.com/2012/09/ultralight-summit-daytrippin.html) last year we had plenty of them, and they were best from the summit of a high mountain. They get even better if you can share the views with a good friend. I'm looking forward to more blue skies, even if it is right now grey-sky-season.

## Who's next?
