Looks like autumn, smells like autumn, yes, it's autumn!

Since I write HIF on Octopress and write my articles in Markdown, you might have realized that links no longer open in a new tab when you click them. This has two reasons: 

- Markdown does not have a "target="_blank" shortcut in its syntax, and I'm too lazy to go back and write links in HTML
- It is good User Experience etiquette to let you choose how to open a link - in the same tab, in a new tab or window, or in a new browser

So while the many of you [those polled on twitter at least =] prefer to have links automatically open in a new tab, I will continue to not force it upon you and let you choose. If you're on a Mac, *Cmd + Click* opens a link in a new tab, while on a Windows computer you probably have to right click the link and choose *Open link in new tab*. Happy browsing!
