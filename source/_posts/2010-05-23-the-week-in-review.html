Another week which just flew by. We were very lucky here in Finland, it has been sunny and above 20°C the whole of last week, sadly I spent the time inside working instead of outside backpacking. To make up for that there was plenty to read.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/jYJRQjbq2mBlJoUsie1xZTWiupv70N-RGKSfyQFBX78?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S_f-d_YVeGI/AAAAAAAACls/DKhxAmrxa6U/s800/IMG_1576.JPG" /></a><br /><br />James from Backpackingbongos takes us on a <a href="The Week In Review">snowy Southern Upland Way circuit</a> and brings back the memories of winter to us. <br /><br />Michael, who thru-hikes the PCT at the moment, finally received his <a href="http://freiwildontour.blogspot.com/2010/05/35.html">Trailname</a>. Also check out the video on the right about the perfect campsite.<br /><br />The Bearded Git went wildcamping in the <a href="http://beardedgit.com/?p=4579">Northern Fells</a> and besides dead sheep and leaning trees there was a acrobatic squirrel...<br /><br />Steven reports life from the <a href="http://www.stevenhorner.com/">TGO Challenge</a> and the problems (and beauty) he encountered - go cheer him up with a comment or <a href="http://twitter.com/stevenhorner">tweet</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://sheddwellersmoments.blogspot.com/">The Shed Dweller</a> is another TGO Challenger who blogs life from the trail, thus for a different take on the Scottish Coast-to-Coast journey head over to his blog.<br /><br /><a href="http://qbloggt.blogspot.com/2010/05/korsika-ultraleicht-anfahrt-und-tag-1.html">Q went to Corsica</a> and brought back this trip report. Sunshine, blue skies, high mountains and the Hitchhikers Guide To the Galaxy make for a good trip report.<br /><br />The Worthing Wanderer walked section 7 of the <a href="http://worthingwanderer.blogspot.com/2010/05/london-loop-section-7-kingston-bridge.html">London Loop</a>, a beautiful story of going for a day walk in one of the most busiest cities in the world. Deer, waterfowl and the signs of spring & summer are definitely making it very interesting.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/05Q7dG0ezg8ehIXUbfKijzWiupv70N-RGKSfyQFBX78?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S_f-wXGWIcI/AAAAAAAACl4/lab4ldntbC4/s800/DSCN0325.JPG" /></a><br /><br />Joe did a great review on the <a href="http://thunderinthenight.blogspot.com/2010/05/optimus-crux-lite-terra-solo-cook.html">Optimus Crux Lite & Terra Solo Cook set</a>, a highly recommended read.<br /><br />Jonas now has his <a href="http://blog.nature-base.de/2010/05/19/ultraleicht-pulka-im-shop/">UL Pulka/ Toboggan</a> ready and show's off some photos on his blog. 400 g is sweet and it is similar in nature to <a href="http://www.fjaderlatt.se/2009/04/along-northern-rails-with-incredible.html">The Incredible Rulk</a> from Jörgen.<br /><br />Roger from Sweden took a <a href="http://trinisla.blogspot.com/2010/05/evernew-ti-dx-notes-from-my-first-test.html">first look at the Evernew Ti DX</a>, probably the most sought after piece of equipment currently in the UL sphere, so go read his initial take on its performance with alcohol and wood.<br /><br />Dave on the other hand <a href="http://armchair-adventurer.blogspot.com/2010/05/burn-up.html">compared three lightweight alcohol stoves</a> and measured their full usage and burn times, thus if alcohol is your fuel of choice go have a look.<br /><br />Benjamin did a review of <a href="http://hrxxlight.com/?p=288">his ZPacks Hexamid shelter</a>, so if a new shelter is something you're looking for, check this out.<br /><br />In other news, Ron from Walking Fort Bragg is <a href="http://walkingfortbragg.com/2010/05/reflecting-on-web.html">reflecting on a spider net</a>. Great photo and thoughts. <br /><br />Dave, The Ultralighter, <a href="http://ultralighter.blogspot.com/2010/05/no-price-too-small.html">talks about the problems</a> encountered by telling people about ultralight backpacking and how they'd love to try it, but can't do without any of the heavy stuff. Good read.<br /><br />Finally, Jörgen from Fjäderlätt gives us some hints on how to use <a href="http://www.fjaderlatt.se/2010/05/handsfree-umbrella.html">an umbrella but still keep your hands free</a> - very useful for the growing number of umbrella users on the trail!</div>
