The idea of the Outdoor Guide Series is based on my [The Outdoor Guide to Helsinki](https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/11/outdoors-in-helsinki.html) article. I have received my fair share of inquiries from people who read Hiking in Finland and visit Helsinki on a business trip and were wondering what they could do in Helsinki over a long weekend in the outdoors. Instead of writing the same email time & again I wrote the Guide article to answer the questions and being able to refer people to it. And I knew there would be a lot of my outdoor friends in towns & cities around the globe who get the same kind of Emails, so the idea to expand it was born. Right now you can find nearly a dozen Outdoor Guides to many different cities around the globe - from Tokyo, Japan to Boulder, Colorado, USA. 

**But it shouldn't stop there!** If you write an outdoor blog, please feel invited to write an Outdoor Guide to your town! [Get in touch and I send you the template](mailto:hendrik@hikinginfinland.com), let me know when the article is online and I will add it to this directory!
