From [climbing & mountaineering in the Polish Tatras](http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/mountaineering-and-climbing-in-the-polish-tatras.html) to hiking and backpacking. In the rain & sunshine, up high in the mountains and low in the valleys.

## Rain & Misery

As we wake up at the Przedni Staw Polski Refuge and I look out from my window the misty hides the mountains and the rain drops leave little circles on the lake. Everything is wet. Marcin and I raise silently and move to the big common room, give in our orders for breakfast and enjoy the tasty food that comes through the small window from the kitchen. Slowly it gets busy, people packing, but with the rain keeping up a constant drum none leave the hut. At ten we're the first ones to venture outside, and we adapted my route to a lower alternative.

Marcin gave me a few options: Walk the easy trail through the valley to the Schronisko Murowaniec refuge, or the shorter but high route across a pass at Orla PerÄ‡. We had light packs, good gear
