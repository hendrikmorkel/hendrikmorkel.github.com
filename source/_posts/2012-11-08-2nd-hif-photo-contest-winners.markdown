##Winners

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/18839278@N00/8090625988/" title="Poll Doo Glen by flanagandave, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8184/8090625988_40a7c5b2f5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Poll Doo Glen"></a>

David takes the crown this time around. A very fine photo, a big, blazing fire and a beautiful sky and background. After a day of bouldering the three friends sit around the fire, while the starry sky is circling above them. While there is a lot of movement in the photo, I find this is part of the charm of it. All in all a very fine photo that interprets the topic of fire well, and adds a scent of adventure, friendship and nature to it.

Gareth submitted a very beautiful and touching image of his son taking in the fire. You can imagien how the little boy enjoys the warmth of the fire after a cold & wet day, and just stars relaxed into the Wilderness TV channel. A beautiful, very emotional image that communicates warmth and security.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/walloftvs/7539459798/" title="Campfire, Mirror Lake, Spanish Peaks, Madison Range, Montana by samhDOTnet, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8292/7539459798_72411a9056_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Campfire, Mirror Lake, Spanish Peaks, Madison Range, Montana"></a>

Sam's fianceé contemplates life at a campfire in the Madison Range. *Magnificent scenery* was my first thought. 
I like how the fire and person are just subtle parts of this photo, the mountains, snow and tree tops grab a lot of attention, and I can imagine how a fire in such a setting is like a beacon of warmth and "civilization".

*All three of you, please contact me [via email](hendrik.morkel@gmai.com). Each of you wins an awesome Light-My-Fire Swedish FireKnife!*

Kermiitti's dog, who's sleeping peacefully by the fire. An emotional and peaceful photo.

Christopher and his wife thru-hiked the PCT this year, and this was the fire they made on the 2nd last day on the trail. A fine way to celebrate a great achievement!

Beni and Anatol warming up by the fire on a trip in the Alps earlier this year. Contemplating, warming up, while in the background you can see hints of the scenery.
