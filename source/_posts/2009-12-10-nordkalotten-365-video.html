<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">If you're following this blog with some regularity, you know that I dream of walking the Nordkalottleden, from Kautokeino in Norway till Kvikkjokk in Sweden, and climb Halti in Finland on the way. I read the only book on the complete trail from cover to cover, I have the maps here at home, and am just wondering when I will have the time window of four to five weeks to walk it. Imagine thus my excitement as I happened to stumble upon an Norwegian TV show called "Nordkalotten 365". The story is quite easy: Lars Monsen, an Norwegian adventurer, spends 365 days alone in Northern Scandinavia, filming himself during his adventures. The result his spectacular, beautiful landscapes which make you want to leave asap. Here is the first part of Episode 1:<br /><br /><object width="480" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/CQMHKWfnDzo&hl=en_US&fs=1&color1=0x234900&color2=0x4e9e00"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/CQMHKWfnDzo&hl=en_US&fs=1&color1=0x234900&color2=0x4e9e00" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object><br /><br />But now the highlight: Norwegian  Broadcasting has made the <a href="http://nrkbeta.no/2008/01/29/norwegian-broadcasting-nrk-makes-popular-series-available-drm-free-via-bittorrent/">show available as a high quality BitTorrent download</a>, completely legal! You can even get <a href="http://subs.hopto.org/">English subtitles</a> for the show! I wish more broadcasting agencies would take this approach, and make their shows available as a BitTorrent download.<br /><br />So while Monsen isn't UL on the trail, quite the contrary actually, I am already really in love with the show, because of his unique humor and the interesting people he meets, not to mention the spectacular landscapes. If you're looking for a documentary which showcases the beauty of Northern Scandinavia, look no further and download Nordkalotten 365!</span></div>
