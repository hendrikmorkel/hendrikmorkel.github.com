If you have been reading my past trip reports with a keen eye and have had a close look at the photos, you surely have seen that I had the <a href="http://cascadedesigns.com/msr/tents/fast-and-light-tents/hubba-hp/product">MSR Hubba HP 2010</a> model for quite a while already. Time for a first look at this solo tent, and what it offers to the lightweight backpacker.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Ahur6LlBqNNn8spUzWWRHLxpDq9gEJgvk51OqCiaYHU?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6CFh8q6CNI/AAAAAAAAB30/eh-SSgPxy4Q/s800/IMG_3220.JPG" /></a><br />MSR Hubba HP 2010 on a trip last autumn, experiencing the first minus degrees of the season.<br /><br />Lets start with the important bits, a break down of the weight:<br /><br />MSR Hubba HP complete: 1385 g<br />Stakes x 6: 59 g<br />Stakes stuff sack: 10 g<br />Repair: 18 g<br />Poles: 347 g<br />Poles stuff﻿ sack: 18 g<br />Outer: 429 g<br />Inner: 463 g<br />Stuff sack: 41 g<br /><br />"That's a lot of stuff sacks" is what I thought, and then I ditched the one for the poles and used a lighter one for the whole set. The MSR Needle stakes which come with the tent are fantastic, I have been using them also with my other tents and tarps, good visibility and easy to get into the ground.<br /><br />As you might know, the internet is a medium where you can use video to the fullest, so before I show different photos and ramble on, have a look at the HD video I made of setting it up:<br /><br /><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/TWxlaDPSVk8&hl=en_US&fs=1&color1=0x234900&color2=0x4e9e00"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/TWxlaDPSVk8&hl=en_US&fs=1&color1=0x234900&color2=0x4e9e00" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object><br /><br />It is a lightweight tent, with using a lighter stuff sack and lighter stakes (even if they're good, Titanium stakes are half the weight!) you can get a trail weight of about 1300 g. But of course the seperate set up of fly and inner also allows you to variate - only inner for summer days with mosquitos and without rain, fly for spring and autumn days with a friend or dog, and both for a winter trip. So you could get away with a trail weight of 860 g for the pole, fly and stakes, if you want.<br /><br />The fly can be set up alone, and in case you take both on a rainy and mosquito infested summer night, you can set up the outer first and then clip in the inner. Personally I find the inner can take those three drops which might hit it in the time I get the fly thown over it. Those who are more afraid of the rain will think different.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Ub2_rQjW5sBccvOpTBkIQ7xpDq9gEJgvk51OqCiaYHU?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6CFpdSDNhI/AAAAAAAAB34/PCHRbivbTI8/s800/IMG_2042.JPG" /></a><br />The inner with a view on the closed door. It is huge.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/CP3CbQZTMTMEcgkCscVJ1rxpDq9gEJgvk51OqCiaYHU?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6CED64j7TI/AAAAAAAAB3s/cLT62kN6p78/s800/IMG_1985.JPG" /></a><br />Completely closed and pitched low.<br /><br />Condensation was never an issue with this tent. Where my <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2009/08/gear-talk-tarptent-scarp-1-initial.html">Scarp 1</a> had a wet inner on some mornings, I yet have to make that experience with the Hubba HP. Great ventilation, but not so that you think it is breezy. The extras like the top net pockets and the side pockets - for some unnecessary, for me nice to keep a tidy tent - are great, zippers are easy running and it is easy to roll up the fly and put it to the side.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/MnIqm-1ue39fX6rcGxewwLxpDq9gEJgvk51OqCiaYHU?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6CEAGdG2NI/AAAAAAAAB3k/wkwA4FdvqYQ/s800/IMG_1903.JPG" /></a><br />And on those days where you want to enjoy the view, pull the fly back and relax.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/-RcWQyk8_Zfx16mLE6k7crxpDq9gEJgvk51OqCiaYHU?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6CEB3Eu39I/AAAAAAAAB3o/8PCAMx4ycUY/s800/IMG_1971.JPG" /></a><br />Space for your backpack and shoes under the fly, and also cooking there is no problem.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/eSWolK2LFQxoRfz3ZkiuALxpDq9gEJgvk51OqCiaYHU?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S6CD9tynq0I/AAAAAAAAB3g/vHr5wPQIXyQ/s800/IMG_1896.JPG" /></a><br />And a look inside. Note on top again the storage net, I really love that!<br /><br />While it has some nice extras, I find it a rather minimalistic tent - in a very positive way. The small footprint and the possibility to set it up with only two stakes mean it is a tent made for the mountains, where a good pitching space is hard to come by. That doesn't mean it won't perform in the forest or on our Fjells in Lapland, though.<br /><br />If you are on the look out for a new solo tent which is 4-season worthy, quick and easy to set up, and of course light, then the MSR Hubba HP might just be what you're looking for. The green fly allows you to go stealth camping and it is a friendly colour to wake up to, the features are well-thought out and the inner and fly set up allows you to be variable - take only the inner when its warm and sunny and you need rest from the bugs, take only the fly when you're with a friend, and take both in winter. You will feel comfortable and safe, in rain, wind and sunshine, with this tent.<br /><br />If this closes the deal for you and you want this tent for your lightweight adventures, check out Ultralight Outdoor Gear who currently offers the <a href="http://www.ultralightoutdoorgear.co.uk/msr_hubba_hp_2_skin_solo_tent_-_2010_high_performance_version_with_green_fly.html">2010 MSR Hubba HP for £269</a>.</div>
