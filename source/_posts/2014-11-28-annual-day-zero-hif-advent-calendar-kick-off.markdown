And so the merry countdown till Christmas begins, and again we kick it off with a fully loaded Day Zero Advent Calendar Door. Lets take a look what's all in there, shall we?

[Unterwegs](http://www.unterwegs.biz/) provides a sweet [Tatonka TA 0211 Daypack](http://www.unterwegs.biz/ta-0211-496163.html?farbe=kauri&groesse=19%20Liter) which is all the rage amongst us outdoorsy Lumbersexuals. It's large enough to carry our provisions and a spare plaid shirt in case we get the one we are wearing dirty when chopping wood. It's durable enough to survive a week in the forest and stylish enough to go to a trendy Café in town.

In our Daypack there's a [Compact Hauler](http://marmot.com/products/details/compact-hauler) from [Marmot](http://www.marmot.eu), a small and useful toiletry bag. It holds all the important cosmetics we need to care for our beards and skin, like the [mawaii](http://mawaii-suncare.com) AllWeatherProtection, [DuoCare SPF30 (Face&Lips)](http://mawaii-suncare.com/Products.html), AfterSun 75ml and LipCare. These help us care for our skin in summer as winter, in -20°C as well as +30°C.

That we can walk with the safety of a wild cat on frozen sidewalks in town we have [Edelrid](http://www.edelrid.de/) [Spiderpick](http://www.edelrid.de/en/Edelrid/Sports/Ice-Axes-Crampons/Spiderpick-icemint.html) snow chains on our shoes. These give us the grip we need on slippery surfaces and frozen lakes alike, and are easy to attach to our shoes and take off again.

On our head we have the [Mammut](http://www.mammut.ch/) [Alyeska Beanie](http://www.mammut.ch/de/productDetail/109004380_v_5617_one_size/Alyeska-Beanie.html), which looks like our grandma knitted it herself for us, but on the inside a cuddly microfleece lining adds even more warmth. 

The [Mountain Laurel Designs](http://www.mountainlaureldesigns.com/shop/) [eVent Mitts](http://www.mountainlaureldesigns.com/shop/product_info.php?cPath=37&products_id=51) on our hands ensure we don't get cold and wet fingers in the snow and wind, and pack so small they fit without problems into our daypack.

[Princeton Tec](http://princetontec.com/) brings since almost 40 years light into the dark, and with their [SYNC](http://princetontec.com/sync) headlamp we can continue to chop wood in the forest even after the night has fallen. The Dualbeam mode will make the night look like day and helps us to find the way back to our cabin when all the food is chopped.

Further inside our pack we find the [Drybag Cordura Light](http://www.vaude.com/de-DE/Produkte/Outdoor-Zubehoer/Drybag-Cordura-Light-20l-orange.html) from [Vaude](http://www.vaude.com/), a waterproof and durable dry sack which has taped seams and weighs just 100 g. 

Inside the dry bag we pack our [Big Sky DreamSleeper Deluxe inflatable pillow with pillow case](http://bigskyproducts.com/Big-Sky-DreamSleeper-Deluxe-inflatable-pillow.aspx) from the [Trekking-Lite-Store.com](http://www.trekking-lite-store.com/trekkingshop/?refID=hif), for those afternoon power naps. A pillow is inherently more comfortable than a log to rest ones head on, and the Deluxe pillow ensure we can power nap in comfort.

Also in the dry bag we pack our [Whoopieslings.com](http://www.whoopieslings.com) gear for our hammock. A pair of [Whoopieslings](http://shop.whoopieslings.com/Whoopie-Slings-AWS.htm), [Tree Huggers](http://shop.whoopieslings.com/Tree-Huggers-TH.htm) and [Toggles](http://shop.whoopieslings.com/Toggles-Pair-TOG-WO.htm) allows us to hang our hammock in the most convenient way possible.

So light and compact packs the [Keg F Stove System](http://www.traildesigns.com/stoves/caldera-keg-f-stove-system) from [Trail Designs](http://www.traildesigns.com/) that we also still fit it in our pack. With it we can easily heat up water for our afternoon coffee (black, no sugar!) or rehydrate meals when we're for a long time out in the woods.

What now doesn't fit into our pack anymore is our tenkara rod and flies for our after-work tenkara session. But that's not a problem because we have a sweet [Tenkara Strap Pack](http://www.zimmerbuilt.com/store/p20/Tenkara_Strap_Pack.html) & [QuickDraw](http://www.zimmerbuilt.com/store/p39/Tenkara__QuickDraw.html) combo from [ZimmerBuilt](http://www.zimmerbuilt.com) to carry them with. The small Strap pack holds our small fly box, tenkara line, tippit and tools and the QuickDraw carries our rod and slides out of the way when we cast our fly to catch that trout for dinner.
