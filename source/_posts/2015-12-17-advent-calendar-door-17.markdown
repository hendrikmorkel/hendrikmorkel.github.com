Dear Santa,

The [Nomadic Stoves Company](http://www.nomadicstovecompany.com) builds its stove in Alaska by hand, and in the winter it can get -60Â°C where Jeff and his wife live - a place thus where you appreciate fire. It is thus no wonder that they know how to build wood stoves, and their [Trekker Stoves](http://www.nomadicstovecompany.com/#!/our-stoves/trekker/) are mighty fine wood stove indeed. Jeff did his Apprenticeship with [Fritz from BushBuddy](https://hikinginfinland.com/2009/11/interview-fritz-handel-from-bushbuddy.html) and now builds his Trekker stoves in three different configurations - the Regular stove and two Ultra stoves which are even lighter. All three burn super efficient and clean with any sort of combustible material - from wood to pine cones and bark, the Trekker stoves allows you to go ultralight by leaving heavy fuel canisters and bottles at home & enjoying the beauty of a wood fire in a save manner!
