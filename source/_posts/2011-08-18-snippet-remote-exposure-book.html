Thus if you're serious about photography, and before you invest more money into new fancy camera gear, first spend the ~ $17 for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1933952652/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=hikiinfinl-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=1933952652">Remote Exposure: A Guide to Hiking and Climbing Photography.</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=hikiinfinl-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1933952652&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" /><br /><br />In the meanwhile, I am working on an article about the <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/105306052609390995141/posts/GNojUGRDB5B" target="_blank">Sony NEX-5 and Panasonic Lumix GF2</a>, which hopefully is ready next week. So after you've read the book, you can read about which lightweight camera you might want to get =)</div>
