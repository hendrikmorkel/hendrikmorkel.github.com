2016 is six months old, time to reflect on the past outdoor months and reveal what lays ahead!

## January

In January I was again on [Åland](https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/02/aland-in-winter.html), this time as a Hostblogger with NBE Finland. It was a superb trip and I loved showing our beautiful country to my fellow blogger friends.

## February

In February I went [ski-touring in South Tyrol](https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/02/ski-touring-south-tyrol-and-salzburger-lungau.html) with my brother, and then we continued to Austria and the Salzburger Lungau. It was a great trip with some good, and some not so good snow.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24460363514/in/album-72157664166747400/" title="I love me a nice cabin!"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/2/1466/24460363514_7edaab5590_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="I love me a nice cabin!"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I love cabins! And my DPS Skis like them too =)

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25736343534/in/album-72157664672954972/" title="Albert ripping it!"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/2/1584/25736343534_f07a20c1bc_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Albert ripping it!"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Our ski guide Albert traded his ski school to backcountry touring. With views like this, who wouldn't?

## March

March started off in Switzerland, where my [Graubünden Haute-Route Tour](https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/03/teaser-graubunden-haute-route.html) didn't go according to plan. But we had a great time nevertheless, and that's what counts.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25455047716/in/album-72157665020355632/" title="Going down."><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/2/1445/25455047716_5a5b16aa20_b.jpg" width="1024" height="684" alt="Going down."></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

March was also the month of skiing and winter activities with the family. First we were in [Hetta](https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/04/hetta-winter-adventures-in-finnish-lapland.html) and had a lot of fun with Huskies, XC skiing and winter hiking, followed by a few nights in Ylläs and then Levi.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26148429495/in/album-72157665518007630/" title="Mom, dad, kids and seven huskies!"><img src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/2/1490/26148429495_885653ee53_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Mom, dad, kids and seven huskies!"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

A husky Tour in Hetta is a must in our opinion. It's so relaxing and fun!

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25333253494/in/album-72157665518007610/" title="Powder turns on Kesänki"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/2/1649/25333253494_d679a86349_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Powder turns on Kesänki"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

While Ylläs is known as the XC Ski Mekka of Finland I loved the ski-touring, too. Imagine finding perfect snow and you can make the first turns!

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28044201296/in/dateposted/" title="Santa&#x27;s Cabin in Levi"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7797/28044201296_a750b77c3b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Santa&#x27;s Cabin in Levi"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Santa's Cabin on Levi is a wee bit off-piste and was built for the Finnish Santa movie from a few years back. It's a beautiful cabin with a great view.

## April

[Lyngen](https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/05/lyngen.html) with Henryk scores high as the most memorable ski-touring trip of the year. 

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25455047716/in/album-72157665020355632/" title="Going down."><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/2/1445/25455047716_5a5b16aa20_b.jpg" width="1024" height="684" alt="Going down."></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

With sunsets like these it is easy to understand why Northern Norway is a photographers paradise, and equally popular amongst climbers & skiers.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26148754883/in/album-72157665452784994/" title="What a view!"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/2/1694/26148754883_8441890563_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="What a view!"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

And also the skiing is pretty awesome, as Henryk here shows.

## May

In may I was on the AdventureNEXT Conference in Macedonia, and went afterwards to Meteora in Greece. The Balkans are a gorgeous region with untapped potential for hiking, climbing, packrafting, bikepacking and will enchant you with the lovely people, tasty food and the pristine mountains and nature.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26965428300/in/album-72157666107618714/" title="Climbing"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7295/26965428300_4a48114bb5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Climbing"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The climbing in Macedonia was great, and I am looking forward to sample more of it in the future.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26505575123/in/album-72157666107618724/" title="Hiking in Meteora"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7060/26505575123_422cb17f12_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Hiking in Meteora"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The same I can say about Meteora in Greece. What an outstandingly beautiful place! 

## June

In June we went on summer holidays with the family to [Vorarlberg](https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/06/impressions-from-the-bregenzerwald-in-vorarlberg-austria.html) in Austria. 

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/27700551721/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Sunrise on the Kanisfluh"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7180/27700551721_12abb83624_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Sunrise on the Kanisfluh"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

That one morning where the sun shone, everything came together on the sunrise hike on the Kanisfluh.

## Onwards

The next six months look pretty good too. Next week I am off to my annual [OutDoor pilgrimage](https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/06/outdoorfn-2016-is-a-go.html), then it is likely to Ireland and Wales, a visit to the south in November, dozens of research trips in Finland and in December I hope to be hunting some snow again. So, **how has your outdoor year been thus far?** What was the most memorable trip, and which trip in the second half of 2016 are you most looking forward to! **Let us know in the comments!**
