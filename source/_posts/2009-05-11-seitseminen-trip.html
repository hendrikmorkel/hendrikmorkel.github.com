<span style="font-size:100%;">I left on Saturday morning as I wasn't able to leave on Friday. I arrived punctually at the bus station and as soon as I entered the bus it started to rain, and it shouldn't stop till six in the evening. The bus arrived in Parkano, from where I started to walk the 19 km to the National Park. After about three kilometers a car on the opposite lane stopped and asked me where I am going. I told the driver, and he told me to get in. He turned around, and the driver told me he saw me walking from the crossroad up ahead, and thought I could need a ride - lucky me! He dropped me off at the Visitor Centre and wished me a good trip. I quickly jumped in the Visitor Centre and asked about the lean-to shelter at Rys√§slammi. The time was now 11.30 and I started walking, walking in the rain.<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2795.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2795.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2801.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2801.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2804.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2804.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2806.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2806.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br />Seiseminen consists of extensive forests, bogs and esker ridges, and there was also an old croft at Kovero on my path. I met one person during the whole trip in the park. It was peaceful, and only the rain and wind were accompanying me.<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2809.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2809.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2811.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2811.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2817.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2817.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2819.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2819.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2822.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2822.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br />I was making good speed on the park's trails, and enjoyed the ups and downs and the walks over the planks, though they were slippery. A cuckoo was calling in the distance. I was still quite dry, walking mainly on broader paths under forest cover.<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2824.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2824.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2825.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2825.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2827.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2827.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br />The landscape changed every kilometer, and I saw moss (or do you call it dosh?) in many different shades of green.<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2829.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2829.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2836.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2836.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2837.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2837.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2842.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2842.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br />The path continued and I was in good spirit. I liked the fresh smell of the wet forest, and the silence. It was clean here. It was pristine nature.<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2853.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2853.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2846.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2846.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2854.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2854.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2859.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2859.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br />After about two hours I arrived at Koverolampi, where there is a campsite and a short walk of 200 meters to the croft. I put my backpack down under a fir and walked to shore of the small lake. It was swampy, and blueberry shrubs were all around. This will be a good place in the autumn to come and collect them.<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2870.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2870.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2874.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2874.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2878.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2878.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2879.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2879.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br />I shouldered my backpack and continued to the croft, where I met the only person during this trip, a daytripper. The old croft is a cultural heritage site, and I looked into the old stables and buildings before I continued my trip to Jokiristi. Part of the path was now a nature path, and some explanatory signs were standing at the side of the path.<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2894.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2894.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2898.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2898.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2904.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2904.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br />The anthill was as tall as me, 175 cm. I was amazed, it must be a old one. On that stretch of the path, there were another three right next to the path. The ants, however, were "inside" and waiting for the rain to stop. Smart ones, as the rain increased and the drops grew bigger. So big actually, that after about four hours I was rather wet. My spirit went down, and I decided to have a break and drink a hot chocolate. At Jokiristi they were building a new shelter, and I stopped in the not finished shelter to cook my hot cacao.<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2907.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2907.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br />Yes, that helped. With fresh energy I continued, as did the rain. I reached the old mill, which was very pretty and would make a good emergency shelter.<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2909.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2909.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2915.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2915.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2917.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_2917.jpg" alt="Seitseminen" border="0" /></a><br /><br />Shortly after the battery died, and I didn't have an extra pack with me. But my spirits were again high, and after passing Liesij√§rvi which had a great camping place I arrived at 18.00 o'clock at the Rys√§slammin lean-to shelter. The fire in front of it was burning, and I suspect that the car which passed me five minutes earlier had the guys  within it which lighted it. I was wet to the bone after six and half hours in the rain, and needed a break. After cleaning the shelter - those guys had their beer cans and garbage thrown in the landscape - I set up the trusty Trangia and cooked me a delicious dinner. About half past seven the sun decided to show itself, and while I ate I enjoyed the view on the lake where a goose was swimming its circles.<br /><br />Not feeling comfortable with the shelter being so close to the forest-road, I decided to continue another 8 km to the next shelter. I arrived at it at 22 o'clock and made a fire to dry my cloths, before I slipped into the sleeping bag and was quickly asleep.<br /><br />At six in the morning the sun shone in my face, as my shelter was on top of a hill and facing slightly east. It was a beautiful morning, with a clear blue sky and no cloud to be seen. After breakfast I broke camp and continued the last 8 km to the town of Kuru, where I had a coffee and cake. The bus would leave in two hours, so I went down to the road to try to hitch a ride. After ten minutes I was on my way back home!<br /><br />All in all it where 35,5 km, of which the majority was the Pirkan-Taival trail. Its an European long distance trail, connecting Seitseminen NP to Helvetinj√§rvi NP and its well marked with good possibilities to camp. I think I will need to check it out during the summer, as its bound to have a route which starts or ends in Tampere!<br /></span></div>
