Dear Santa,

with the baselayers and the motivation to move sorted we are almost ready to head out on our winter adventures. But then it hit me: It's too cold for a windjacket - a hardshell is needed. But something that breathes well because snowshoeing and skiing can be strenuous, and it needs to keep also wind & snow at bay. Thus something like the [Westcomb Focus LT Hoody](http://www.outdoorline.sk/en/waterproof-jackets-smocks/181-westcomb-focus-lt-hoody.html). Made from eVent it is a waterproof-breathable jacket that's a mere 255 g heavy - perfect for ultralight winter trips! A great hood also protects the head in a blizzard and the Napoleon pocket holds the map. 

*Though what about socks for hiking or are you going barefoot?* you ask, Santa? Well, as it's Saint Nicholas Day today, maybe a pair of [Darn Tough Light Hiker Micro Crew Light Cushion](http://www.outdoorline.sk/en/socks/311-darn-tough-light-hiker-micro-crew-light-cushion.html) would be good? I know [Outdoorline.sk](http://www.outdoorline.sk/en/) is one of the few European Ultralight Shops who offers these, and they really are superb what I hear. With these two fine gifts I am ready to head out into the snow.

Sincerely yours,


The Ultralighter
