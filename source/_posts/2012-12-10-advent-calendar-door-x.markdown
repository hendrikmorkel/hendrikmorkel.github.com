Dear Santa,

nothing says outdoors to me like a nice warm fire. A fire: it gives warmth, a place to get together, to cook, and just watch as the flames dance around. Sadly it is not always possible to make a real fire, though the second best alternative is a Trekker stove from the [Nomadic Stove Company](http://www.nomadicstovecompany.com/) - they're made by Jeff, an apprentice of Master Woodstove maker [Fritz Handel](http://hikinginfinland.com/2009/11/interview-fritz-handel-from-bushbuddy.html) of Bushbuddy fame, and Jeff's stoves are just as well made as Fritz' - and in the USA, up in cold Alaska. The [Trekker stove](http://www.nomadicstovecompany.com/#!/our-stoves/trekker/) comes in a regular and in Ultra versions, and being a gram counter I think the Ultra 004 would be just perfect for my trips where a real fire isn't possible, but I want the benefits of it. I'm ver much looking forward to cook on it, Santa!

Have a great start into the new week,
