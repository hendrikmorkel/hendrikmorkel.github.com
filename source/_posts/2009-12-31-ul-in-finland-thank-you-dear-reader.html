<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">Its the last day of 2009, and I'd like to use today to thank my readers for reading my blog, and keeping me motivated to write and report about my UL adventures here in beautiful Finland. Without you and your comments and questions, Hiking in Finland wouldn't be as successful & interesting as it is. It is very rewarding to get the positive feedback that what I do inspires others to lighten their load and get familiar with the UL philosophy. I's also like to thank my fellow outdoor bloggers, because they inspire me with new ideas and to push my own boundaries in terms of writing, photography, trips and getting more skillful and lightweight with my gear.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/b_YsswtqWIF3x13DJElaiw?authkey=Gv1sRgCLaFg7Ci4YWMiwE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/SzzBtAybO8I/AAAAAAAABQc/d7CWMhB74sM/s800/_MG_4099.JPG" /></a><br /><br />I started out in April and what went from a few posts per month grew to a few posts per week, with improvements in photos and writing. Lately I also have been fiddling around with videos, which I do enjoy quite a lot because it gives the opportunity to illustrate things much better, so I will continue with these in the future. What else can you expect in 2010 from Hiking in Finland? <br /><br />Well, obviously there will be more trips. A winter tour in the beginning of February with UL backpackers from Germany, in late May I will visit Sweden to meet up with fellow Scandinavian outdoor bloggers, as well as an April trip to Ruka, close to the Russian border. Summer and autumn will see me hopefully in Lapland, be it on the Nordkalottleden or in one of the various beautiful National Parks is not set yet. I'll spent hopefully some weekends on the Pirkan Taival trail, and also visit parts of the Satakunta Reitti. <br /><br />Writing about gear, making videos about it and taking good and interesting photographs, will be another part of this blog in the coming year. While 2009 saw me going from a "normal" backpacker to a lightweight/ ultralightweight backpacker, I want to try to push my boundries, increase my skills and go SUL in 2010. A new backpack from Laufbursche will be the foundation, further gear I will showcase and review after objective testing on the Finnish trails =)<br /><br />Also there will be more interviews with cottage manufacturers, these give me the opportunity to give something back to the UL community and showcase the people behind the gear. There will be a wild mix of US, UK, Canadian, German and French cottage manufacturers telling their tale in 2010, so I'd suggest you subscribe to the RSS feed or become a follower to stay tuned!<br /><br />Once more, thank you dear readers for a very enjoyable year 2009. Without you and your continuous support and interest in my writings, this blog wouldn't be the same =) I wish all of you a good start into 2010, and may your trails lead you some day to Finland!</span></div>
