Dear Santa,

a small and compact backpack is a beautiful thing: It carries everything you need for a dayhike, fits on a plane and also works to carry your Mac to work. The [Kompressor Verve 26](http://marmot.com/products/details/kompressor-verve-26) from [Marmot](http://www.marmot.de) is such a backpack: At 770 g its pretty light, and the D-shaped zipper allows for full access to the content inside. A single Trekking Pole Attachment carries the poles or axe during scrambles, mesh side pockets hold the water bottles and a lid pocket stores wallet, keys and snacks on the go. The pack is slim and from durable materials, which makes it an ideal companion for cragging, exploring and urban adventures - thus all the things I have planned for 2016!
