I recently received a new alcohol stove from Japan, a wonderful little masterpiece. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/5613857688/" title="Untitled by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5107/5613857688_1f98385576_z.jpg" width="640" height="426" alt=""></a><br />Closed stove and pot stand.<br /><br />I'm not too much of an alcohol stove user, as I prefer wood (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4t4rg2ESvs">Backcountry Boiler, anyone?</a>). However, I was so intrigued by this stove that I decided to buy one and rekindle my interest in alcohol stoves. <br /><br />It is a carbon felt stove, and the flame can be extinguished and then the rest of the alcohol can be safely transported in the stove - that is something which remembers me of my Trangia from earlier days. Very nice and useful, a reason for me to get it.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/5613272031/" title="Untitled by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5108/5613272031_b5bed51dec_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt=""></a><br />The four parts of the stove.<br /><br />The craftsmanship is superb, as you would expect from something from Japan, as I also say in the video. A lovely little unit, and at 53 g together a pretty light setup. A windscreen, like the Clikstand Ti windscreen, would add 21 g to this, though apparently there's even lighter ones around.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/5613281289/" title="Untitled by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5227/5613281289_31849cc58d_z.jpg" width="640" height="426" alt=""></a><br /><br />Outside, at 5Â°C ambient temperature, and a slight wind, and 500 ml of water, I estimate the time till a rolling boil will be around 12 minutes - less if you use a windscreen (I stopped after 10 minutes and as the first bubbles started to rise - I had to get home for dinner =). Testing it in my kitchen I had a rolling boil (600 ml this time) after 7 minutes 45 seconds, this is respectable. I'm never in a hurry when hiking, and don't mind waiting for a while to get my water - enjoying the scenery, having a chat or being are good things to do while waiting for the water to boil.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/5637361974/" title="Untitled by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5224/5637361974_ba19bc53a7_z.jpg" width="426" height="640" alt=""></a><br /><br />In my kitchen test the stove was burning for well over 20 minutes with the circa 25 ml of alcohol I poured in it, pretty nice. Thus if you actually cook on the trail, then this could be a good tool for you, as in my tests so far it is pretty fuel efficient.<br /><br /><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/22340654?byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ff9933" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkvP7khDB1k">Watch the Youtube HD video here</a>.<br /><br />This are only my initial impression with this great little stove, I'm looking forward to taking it out to the trail and see how it performs there. <a href="http://moonlight-gear.com/?pid=24379785"target="_blank">Moonlight Gear</a> sells Sanpo's CF Stove if you want one.
