Dear Santa,

with December weather not being able to make up its mind, I leave behind my [trailrunners](http://shopeu.ecco.com/fi/fi/ecco/ecco-biom-ultra-men_1690664/1690677?navId=332&page=-1&price=89-260) and am in need of some boots. Yes, some ankle high boots should be in this slush/ rain/ snow and cold mix weather just right, and [ECCO](http://global.ecco.com/) makes just the shoe I had in mind: The [ECCO BIOM Terrain](http://global.ecco.com/en/sport/outdoor#!biom-terrain/tech). It's available for [Women](http://shopeu.ecco.com/fi/fi/ecco/ecco-biom-terrain-ladies_1783564/1783570?navId=319) and [Men](http://shopeu.ecco.com/fi/fi/ecco/ecco-biom-terrain-men-s_1784422/1784425?navId=332&page=-1&price=89-260), and both have a Gore-TexÂ® lining to keep the slush away from the feet as well as a Yak leather upper that survives scrambles on sharp rocks. Oh, and great grip they have too. These should be great in the snow & slush, and my warm and happy toes will thank you for your kindness!

Sincerely yours,


An aspiring lightpacker
