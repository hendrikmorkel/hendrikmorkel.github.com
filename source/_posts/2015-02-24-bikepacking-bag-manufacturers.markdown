description: The Bikepacking Framebag Manufacturer List helps you find a maker of framebags for your next off-road adventure.

Fatbikes, Mountain Bikes, 29er, Road Bikes and Bikepacking go hand-in-hand. So that you are ready for your next bikepacking adventure and don't need to rely on old panniers which make riding Singletrack simply not fun, here's an up-to-date list of people and companies which produce framebags.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/10410128705" title="Dawn by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3799/10410128705_2ce65c655f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Dawn"></a>

<!-- more -->

Framebags allow you to explore trails and tracks with all your gear packed in a lightweight, streamlined and rack-less method, without any panniers which hang off the back and front wheels and which make navigating singletrail tracks not pleasueable - if not impossible. With your camping gear in framebags - which covers handelbar bags, seatbags, top tube bags and (half) frame bags - you have a possibility to carry all your gear on your bike and are able to explore trails far off the beaten track, with your bike behaving as responsive and ergonomic as usual. 

But not just for off-road travel by bike framebags are a smart choice, also for cycle-touring and commuting a half frame bag and top tube bag are great choices to store essential gear on the go. You easily can carry a pump, patch kit and more in a half frame bag, and the top tube bag stores snacks, your camera and phone with easy access during your ride. Both my bikes sport frame bags and I wouldn't want to miss them on bikepacking adventures and commutes to town.

For easier reference I sorted the makers into locations - Europe, North America and the rest of the world. Know someone who should be on this list? [Email me](mailto:hendrik@hikinginfinland.com).
