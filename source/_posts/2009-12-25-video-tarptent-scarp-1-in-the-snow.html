<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">If you read the comments on this blog you might know that I spent the the night from Tuesday on Wednesday outside in the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/2009/08/gear-talk-tarptent-scarp-1-initial.html">Scarp 1</a> (Mk I). I travelled Tuesday evening to Vaasa, on the west coast of Finland, where I spend the holidays with my girlfriend and her parents. They live a bit outside of the city and own a lot of forest, so I decided to take some backpacking gear with me and test it under safe conditions. Arriving in Vaasa Tuesday night it was snowing quite heavily, and temperatures were at -7Â°C so I decided it might be a good night to put up the Scarp 1 and see how it fares in the snow. See the short video about my night outside and have a look into and at the Scarp 1:<br /><br /><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/2XLt4ND1fJM&hl=en_US&fs=1&color1=0x234900&color2=0x4e9e00"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/2XLt4ND1fJM&hl=en_US&fs=1&color1=0x234900&color2=0x4e9e00" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object><br /><br />Meanwhile <a href="http://bazbackpack.blogspot.com/">Baz</a> has <a href="http://bazbackpack.blogspot.com/2009/12/henry-shires-scarp-1-first-look.html">received the Scarp 1 Mk II</a> and played around with it, so head over there to have a look at the revisions Henry Shires did. Looks good, and I think I might get the new fly for winter use. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Update 27.12.2009</span>: Last night it snowed, and this morning the Scarp 1 was covered with 9 cm of snow. I thought I share some of the photos I took this morning:<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/_IeVVRD2wrfAmLedA_tAJA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/Szdx2SYXNDI/AAAAAAAABOg/nTYJA0zf_k0/s800/IMG_4595.JPG" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/-JERzUxmrlkLCo8FR2CyEw?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/Szdx4kZFTjI/AAAAAAAABOo/6lHV2J53RGc/s800/IMG_4598.JPG" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Gy_3OzrW0WzA63GKqm-dVg?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/Szdx5vQo7WI/AAAAAAAABOs/fvsoMrUz4b4/s800/IMG_4600.JPG" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Gq0ZO7R6eQmZNPhGEO2_3Q?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/Szdx7J4a_aI/AAAAAAAABOw/s9kfLQrrAMg/s800/IMG_4603.JPG" /></a><br /><br />This should show also the last skeptics that the Scarp 1 can handle winter conditions just fine. </span></div>
