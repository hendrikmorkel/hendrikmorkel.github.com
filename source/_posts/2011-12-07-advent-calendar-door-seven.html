What a mistake! Mid-way a strong wind started to blow, chilling me to the bone, and the onsetting drizzle a bit later didn't really improve the situation. I was running home as fast as I could, where I heated up the Sauna and had a hot Minttu Chocolate to warm myself up from the inside. After my body temperature was close to 37°C again, I sat down to find out about light windshirts with a tiny packsize. <a href="http://www.haglofs.com/en-US/"target="_blank">Haglöfs</a> from Sweden make one, called the <a href="http://www.haglofs.com/en-US/products/clothing/layers/intense/men/shield_pullover_en-us.aspx"target="_blank">Shield Pullover</a>. It is highly wind and water resistant, so will keep me warm in such wind and drizzle I experienced today, and because it packs so small I would not need to leave it behind! It even has thumbloops and reflective detailing, so I can wear it when I go running in the mornings, and I can put my keys and smartphone into the zippered chestpocket. And with such a small packsize, you should not have any problems fitting it into my stockings!<br /><br />Best,<br /><br /><br /><i>- An aspiring UL-Backpacker</i><br /><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/br_t8FTNZEPCXLH44iH9qWiBcik-iSu3FtqWq-IAnas?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-aQKePwOvLA0/TteUW1SiZFI/AAAAAAAAFnk/SjhOUk-BaU4/s800/Hagl%2525C3%252583%2525C2%2525B6fs_Logo_Basic.jpg" height="300" width="212" /></a><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/qBjIEbWmlzoH-Q3YqpJuaGiBcik-iSu3FtqWq-IAnas?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ZR7hWVDj8ow/TtZV8920ISI/AAAAAAAAFnI/rleQd-1bOUo/s640/DSC01599.jpg" height="426" width="640" /></a><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/4qLC0PhnuCybzLH8BcejVWiBcik-iSu3FtqWq-IAnas?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-3paM5wvCQUI/TtZV-Y4gQsI/AAAAAAAAFnM/gJ8LAHIniQ0/s640/DSC01600.JPG" height="426" width="640" /></a><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/xS5GUVofKZ-MOIW0vUgL1miBcik-iSu3FtqWq-IAnas?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ZiNix3iGy1s/TtZV_c3VnZI/AAAAAAAAFnQ/KWzBdJl7G0M/s640/DSC01603.JPG" height="426" width="640" /></a><br /><br />Leave a comment and tell us where you want to use this garment.
