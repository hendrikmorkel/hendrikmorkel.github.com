Dear Santa,

With a nice woodstove for fire  and down socks for warm feet in our backpack we have the means to keep mind & body warm. But that leaves the stomach - and an empty stomach means you will get cold, no matter how much fire & down you have. Thus a warm meal from the [OutdoorFoodShop](http://www.outdoorfoodshop.de) would be ideal to keep my stomach full and hence mind & body warm. Not just does the OutdoorFoodShop offer over a dozen different food brands - they also have a great [MYOG Buffet](http://www.outdoorfoodshop.de/selbermachen/index.php#.VHzDNJZXfCQ) where one can create her own dehydrated meals! With a couple of meals in my backpack my mind, feet and stomach will stay warm on my winter journeys.

Sincerely yours,


The Ultralighter
