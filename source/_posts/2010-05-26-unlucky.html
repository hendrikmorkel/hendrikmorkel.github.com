I checked-in online today in the afternoon, chose my seat, printed the ticket, started packing and checked the bus timetable to the airport for the morning. All looked fine, until about two hours ago as I got a text from Blue1 which told me that my flight is cancelled.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/bGxOEjGAfTyMUjlQ1R-PqzWiupv70N-RGKSfyQFBX78?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S_2C5t1hgXI/AAAAAAAACnE/J84oiWMvmhM/s800/Screen%20shot%202010-05-26%20at%2011.08.12%20PM.jpg" /></a><br /><br />After 25 minutes on the phone I finally managed to speak to someone, who told me that <a href="http://www.goldenair.se/huvudmeny/boka.aspx">Golden Air's pilots</a> are on strike and that thus the flight got cancelled. I was able to reschedule to a flight in the afternoon at 1525, but as the pilots are likely to be on strike till Friday according to the website, it is not looking good. Golden Air operates all flights for Blue1 & SAS between Sweden and Finland, in case you're wondering.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/0hK81VS9Av0V_0JwwJVNdDWiupv70N-RGKSfyQFBX78?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S_2C5LukOMI/AAAAAAAACnA/G0b-7UcTftI/s800/Screen%20shot%202010-05-26%20at%2011.05.48%20PM.jpg" /></a><br /><br />I still have the chance of flying with <a href="http://www.finnair.com/finnaircom/wps/portal/finnair/jump?locale=en_INT">Finnair</a>, who seem to be not on strike. I will need to make the decision tomorrow morning, when I know if my flight goes or not. Until then, I will stay optimistic and hope for the best - it would suck if the SBM would take place and I wouldn't be there. Keep your thumbs up that all goes well =)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">UPDATE:</span> It seems like Blue1 hired Danish Air Transport to fly the 1525 flight, and after confirmation via phone it seems to be on schedule and will fly! So I will get to Stockholm - not just hoping that now Tornado or similar ruins it =)</div>
