Yes, <a href="http://phil-turner.net/">Phil</a> and <a href="http://www.stevenhorner.com/">Steven</a> will arrive in about two hours in Finland, and in three more hours we will take the bus to our starting point. I will take them off to explore the Finnish forest and lake scenery while camping and fly fishing with our tenkara gear, hopefully we'll be able to report about a catch or two at the end of the trip! <br /><br />Phil is technically very skilled and set up this site where you can follow us: <a href="http://phil-turner.net/?page_id=931">Click!</a> So if you're curious to see where we'll be walking, check that link =)<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/NCE1qDi19WyqpoQWtsMw5_OMIrFnwhsBwaRfU1lT6O0?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S9gfc-WviDI/AAAAAAAACUA/I6Br4UUk2Io/s800/P1040320.jpg" /></a><br />Wild camp on a ridge near Ruka last week.</div>
