After last weeks popular "<a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2011/01/week-in-review_16.html"target="_blank">The Week in Review - Mystery Edition</a>" we're back with a reload! <br /><br />Okay, not today =) It's the "Video Madness" edition.<br /><br /><iframe title="YouTube video player" class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/S_c3-3XDsEE?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowFullScreen></iframe><br /><br /><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/14600175?byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ff9933" width="640" height="320" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /><br /><iframe title="YouTube video player" class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/3CCprRczPOI?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowFullScreen></iframe><br /><br /><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/19022689?byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ff9933" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /><br /><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/19005970?byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ff9933" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><br /><br /><iframe title="YouTube video player" class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/fA_rBNeVtzo?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowFullScreen></iframe><br /><br /><b>News & Various</b>:<br /><br /><a href="http://littleboingmarks.blogspot.com/2011/01/color-study-for-mood.html"target="_blank">Mike Clelland! thinks about a wilderness-themed graphic novel</a>. Check out his mood study and let him know that you want one!<br /><br />A new lightweight backpacking blog from Finland worthy of your attention is <a href="http://korpijaakko.wordpress.com/"target="_blank">http://korpijaakko.wordpress.com/</a>. Jaakko is a regular reader and we met last year at the Erämessut in Riihimäki, and his site surely will become a wealth of knowledge for people who're interested in Arctic adventures. <br /><br />Antti's blog is also worth checking out at <a href="http://longdistancetrail.wordpress.com/"target="_blank">http://longdistancetrail.wordpress.com/</a>. He writes about Long Distances trails around the world, and if that is only remotely of interest to you, you should surf there immediately.<br /><br />Want to take your photography up a notch? Then read <a href="http://www.lightstalking.com/dof/DOF.pdf"target="_blank">The Photographer’s Guide to Depth of Field</a>.<br /><br />Gavin realized that <a href="http://gavinmacfie.blogspot.com/2011/01/photo-in-hand-is-worth-thousand-in-hard.html"target="_blank">a Photo in the Hand is worth a thousand in the Hard Drive</a>. I concur. Though <a href="http://db.tt/gK2oaRK"target="_blank">Dropbox is a awesome alternative</a>.<br /><br />Ed likes <a href="http://edemtbs.blogspot.com/2011/01/trees.html"target="_blank">trees</a>. I like Ed's photos of trees.<br /><br /><a href="http://thf2.wordpress.com/2011/01/20/i-need-a-trail-name/"target="_blank">thf2 needs a Trail Name</a>. I think so, too.<br /><br />Jeremy blogs about <a href="http://treklightly.blogspot.com/2011/01/runner-in-winter-running-times.html"target="_blank">The Runner in Winter</a> and yes, it includes a fine video. <br /><br />Timo reports on the <a href="http://www.grammari.com/2011/01/kuusamon-finngrip-easy-suksiside.html"target="_blank">new ski binding from Kuusamon Uistin</a> and made one himself. Sweet.<br /><br />Angelo recommends the <a href="http://creakofboots.blogspot.com/2011/01/hoh-rain-forest.html"target="_blank">Hoh Rain Forest</a> in case you find yourself on the Olympic Peninsula in western Washington.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2011/01/who-is-lightest-of-them-all.html"target="_blank">Who is the lightest of them all?</a> was a post this week by yours truly, in which I tried to say that it is not gear, but the outdoors, that count for me.
