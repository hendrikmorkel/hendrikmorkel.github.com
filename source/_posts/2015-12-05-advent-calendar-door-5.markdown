Dear Santa,

Eating outdoors: Some prefer plastic bags, other titanium pots, but those who want to eat in style take their [Kupilka Premium Set](http://www.kupilka.fi/en/products/kupilka-premium) along. Proper cutlery lets one eat sophisticated with knife, fork and spoon, as well as an dessert spoon for the pudding. A Kupilka 44 plate is great for fish and salad, while the Kupilka 55 bowl is the right choice for soups and stews. One doesn't need to be thirsty, either: The Kupilka 21 makes a great cup for red wine, coffee and water alike, and for stronger liquids the Kupilka 5 is the right choice. Best of all: After one is done eating & drinking one can rinse the [Kupilka](http://www.kupilka.fi/en/) products easily to get them clean - or if you're in your cottage you can even put them in the dishwasher! A great choice for those who like to cook and feast at home & on the trail - and those tired eating from plastic bags!
