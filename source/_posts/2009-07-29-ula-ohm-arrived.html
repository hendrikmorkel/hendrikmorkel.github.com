<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">Well, I think I just experienced the best customer service ever. Yes, my highly anticipated </span><a href="http://www.ula-equipment.com/ohm.asp"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">ULA Ohm</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"> arrived today. I went in the afternoon to the customs office to pick it up; paid 32€ for it at the customs additionally to the 140€ I cost me. <br /><br />I filled it up with my gear, two days of food, two liters of water and  had plenty of room to spare. I went out on the hill behind my house for some testing. Its very comfortable, soft on the back thanks to my TAR Prolite 4 which I used for the backpad, though I might replace it with another backpad in the future (probably a TAR Z-lite for the back and a NeoAir for sleeping). Shoulder straps are comfortable as well, just the front belt feels small, but coming from a Gregory Palisade 80 I guess that's just normal. The construction is superb, all seams are perfectly sewn and should be able to endure quite some abuse.<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&current=IMG_0800.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_0800.jpg" border="0" alt="ULA Ohm"></a><br />Front<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&current=IMG_0801.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_0801.jpg" border="0" alt="ULA Ohm"></a><br />Left side<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&current=IMG_0802.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_0802.jpg" border="0" alt="ULA Ohm"></a><br />Right side<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&current=IMG_0803.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_0803.jpg" border="0" alt="ULA Ohm"></a><br />Back<br /><br />I went for an one hour walk, bushwacking up the hill as I wanted to see how well it is made. It had no problems with the trees, stones and shrubs I passed by, and it left me enough maneuverability to even climb small stretches - something which was very difficult with my previous pack. Its easy to access the Platypus in the side pockets, and the hipbelt pockets are huge and  easily hold my phone, wallet, knife or my camera (Canon Ixus), müsli bars and keys. Huge and very handy. I stashed the waterproofs in the front mesh pocket, and hope that the tent I am expecting will fill in one of the side pockets, if not it should fit easily on top. Its going be thoroughly tested next week, as a friend from Germany spontaneously decided to come for a visit next week and asked if we could go hiking =)<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&current=IMG_0798.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_0798.jpg" border="0" alt="ULA Ohm"></a><br /></span></div>
