I just got back from the Pirkan Ura/ Pirkan Taival/ <a href="http://www.reitti.org/index.php">Satakunta Reitti</a> trail (yes, several trails on top of each other!) where I was with Xavier. Bushwacking, snow, minus degrees, testing new gear. I'm taking my time to collect my thoughts on it, and leave you with this teaser from the weekend. More during the coming week.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/PNfd4BEcrwyrtz0GI0n-zQ?authkey=Gv1sRgCLaFg7Ci4YWMiwE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/SyUr4Tc-LxI/AAAAAAAABHc/yca6FMTorV0/s800/IMG_4182.JPG" /></a></div>
