<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">So, its almost weekend again and I decided to go tomorrow to </span><a href="http://www.luontoon.fi/page.asp?Section=5327"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">Seitseminen</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">, another National Park close by. The weather forecast says rain on Saturday, so I hope its not the 24/7 rain and just the occasional shower now and then. Reason for this hops: no tent. I am still saving up to order </span><a href="http://www.tarptent.com/scarp1.html"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">Henry Shires' Scarp 1</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">, thus till then I will sleep under the sky or lean-to shelters. Should hopefully not take to long =) </span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:100%;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 13px;"><br /></span></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:100%;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 13px;">I'll start tomorrow, take a bus at noon to Parkano and hopefully catch the bus to the Visitors Centre. From there I'll walk down to Kovero, and from there to Seitsemisjoki or Jokristi for the night. If it looks like it will rain, I'll walk to the Kirkaslampi cooking shelter and sleep there. Saturday I was planning to walk down to Saari-Soljanen and climb the Bird-watching towers, back up to the Mill, then to Liesij√§rvi and following the Pirkan taival trail till the Rysylampi, where I will camp. Sunday then walk till Kuru, and try to hitch a ride back to Tampere. It should be a nice trip, I'll report back next week with plenty of photos!</span></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.luontoon.fi/image.asp?Image=Att6624\webatt_20090130_154234_359974.gif"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 545px; height: 751px;" src="http://www.luontoon.fi/image.asp?Image=Att6624\webatt_20090130_154234_359974.gif" border="0" alt="" /></a><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"><br />On further trip news, after reading the </span><a href="http://backpackingbongos.wordpress.com/2009/04/26/a-scottish-coast-to-coast-evanton-to-ullapool-pt1/"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">Backpackingbongos' Scottish Coast to Coast</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"> trip I got so excited that I wrote my mate in Germany and asked if he would be up to do the same trip. He replied almost immediately and said yes, and proposed October for it. So now we're in planning mode for this trip. Approximate date is the first week of October, around 2nd till 11th or 12th - this includes the days traveling there! I have not done much research on it yet, but I am wondering if October is a good time to be up there. Answers I received reach from "Splendid, October is for hiking in Scotland!" till "Cold, miserable and wet". While I know that the weather is unpredictable, a bit of an idea would be useful. Thus if anyone knows something, or has some recommendations and tips, please leave them in the comments! Also book recommendations are welcome, and if you have tips for what gear would be useful, let me know as well, my mate needs to invest in new gear after he lost his in the same accident as me.</span><br /></span></div>
