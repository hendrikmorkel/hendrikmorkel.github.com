Dear Santa,

Hunger. Food. Outdoors. A threesome, which can be very enjoyable when the right food is along, or very miserable when there isn't any food, or it's not to ones taste. Happily the [Outdoor Food Shop](http://www.outdoorfoodshop.de) has made it its mission to supply us hikers, bikepackers, packrafters, climbers & backpackers a very wide variety of high quality outdoor food and nutrition substances, and a package from them is sure to make your next outdoor adventure also a culinary adventure - with food from the best [outdoor food brands](http://www.outdoorfoodshop.de/marken/index.php) no wonder! I'd love you to bring me a package from the [Outdoor Food Shop](http://www.outdoorfoodshop.de), so that I can look with joy forward to the next breakfast & dinners on the trail.

Enjoy your meal, 



*An aspiring UL Backpacker*
