<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">We reached the end of this little series, which I enjoyed writing a lot as it also helped me to reevaluate and think about my gear. The most interest received the article about the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/2009/08/ul-beginners-guide-big-three.html">Big 3</a>. I guess looking at big shiny equipment is what the majority likes =) Nevertheless, the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/2009/08/ul-beginners-guide-clothing-footwear.html">clothing and footwear</a> article highlighted that there are also significant possibilities to save weight with the clothes you wear and the shoes on your feet. Yesterday I looked at the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/2009/08/ul-beginners-guide-kitchen.html">kitchen and miscellaneous</a> little items which we always carry with us, and what good lightweight options there are for these.<br /><br />So lets combine the whole package, and see the total. I used <a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/numbers/">Numbers</a> to make a nice packing list (Credit to <a href="http://theotherface.wordpress.com/">The Other Face</a> who sent me his German version, and which I changed to suit my needs). Lets have a look: <br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/6ELZ6AJrZMhJjN2MZkgpfQ?authkey=Gv1sRgCN6g8cTAg5HhTQ&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/Sp1BxDY4pSI/AAAAAAAAAR4/tVadeGCrxeA/s800/Example_packing_list.jpg" /></a><br /><br />We got the backpack, stuff sacks and a rain cover there, 834 g in total, not bad. There are lighter options for both rain cover and stuff sacks out there, and I guess I'll get some from <a href="http://www.mountainlaureldesigns.com/">Mountain Laurel Design</a> which make fantastic UL gear.<br /><br />Sleeping system and the shelter weight 2426 g. My GoLite Ultra 20Â° will keep me toasty, and the NeoAir is so comfortable that I will not switch to a CCF mat - which means I might not be able to rise at 5 o'clock in the morning to <a href="http://hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/2009/08/pirkan-taival-kuru-helvetinjarvi-np.html">snap photos of the dawn</a>. For the winter I need to look for a new sleeping bag/ quilt which will push that likely a bit up, except I win in the lottery and can afford one of the amazing <a href="http://www.nunatakusa.com/">Nunatak</a> quilts. There are lighter options for tents available, but I love my <a href="http://hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/2009/08/gear-talk-tarptent-scarp-1-initial.html">Scarp 1</a> thus will happily carry the few hundred gram extra. <br /><br />My kitchen weights a respectable 395 g, I will add a little 100 ml bottle of alcohol to fire up the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/2009/08/myog-meth-stove.html">MYOG top burner</a> for when I'm too tired to look for wood for my BushBuddy Ultra. An Inferno + Ti-Tri stove from <a href="http://traildesigns.com/">Trail Designs</a> will find its way to me soon, so there even are slight possibilities of me decreasing the weight further and remaining a fire devil!<br /><br />My worn clothes weigh 1604 g, there are some possibilities to shave some further grams off there, for example by getting lighter shoes and pants (The <a href="http://www.shelby.fi/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=21&products_id=200">Shelby Koruoma pant</a> is a project I will be working on during the winter). The clothes in my backpack are light at 1211 g, and will protect me from rain and cold efficiently. I forgot to add my Trekmates Amphibian GoreTex socks, which weigh 73 g and also should keep my feet dry as a desert.<br /><br />Those various items are the heaviest piece on the list, with 2810 g - but that's due to the EOS 50D and the LowePro Toploader I carry. Dave, The Armchair Adventurer, made himself <a href="http://armchair-adventurer.blogspot.com/2009/05/self-build-camera-bag-part-1.html">a very nice camera bag</a>, which I might try to reproduce. That should make it slightly lighter, but having witnessed the difference between point and click and the power of a DSLR my decision was made easy: the DSLR comes along! The towel can be replaced by a small & light UL version, probably saving some 100 g.<br /><br />Food and water, well, 700 g per day might be a bit much, but its important to have sufficient energy on the trail for me. If I would switch from Ramen and Pasta to <a href="http://www.drytech.no/">Real Turmat</a> I could save some weight per day, and it should definitely taste better. <br /><br />So, for a weekend out, from Friday afternoon till Sunday early evening I would start with a pack weight of 11505 g. Ideally that will mean I come home with a backpack which weights 7755 g as I eat and drink away my consumables. I like it. Going light means I can walk more kilometers, take extras like the DSLR which I wouldn't carry if I go "normal" and climb higher. Its natural. <br /><br />I thank you for reading and inspiring me, I had interesting conversations with some readers in the comments - join us if you like! Going light was a very good experience for me, and hopefully this little series has shown that it is not difficult to lose some weight and still be safe and comfortable on the trail! <br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/bEAINIsygCM_JNX1kSWlZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/Sp1LC1iQjGI/AAAAAAAAASg/V1LiPKyI7eM/s800/IMG_0911.JPG" /></a></span></div>
