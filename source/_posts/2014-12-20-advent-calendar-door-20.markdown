Dear Santa,

All this talk of snow, winter, summer, Italy et al. makes me recall the good times I had this [summer packrafting](http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/07/pack-sail-rafting-in-the-kvarken-archipelago.html) right here at home in the Kvarken Archipelago. Sometimes the good things are right in front of your nose. And as there's plenty of rivers right here - and of course the Baltic Sea! - I was thinking some winter packrafting might be in order next weekend. It's a good thing the [Packrafting Store](http://www.packrafting-store.eu/) has their line of [Anfibio](http://www.packrafting-store.de/advanced_search_result.php?keywords=Anfibio+made&x=-442&y=-246) gear, some great accessories for packrafting and backpacking. I was thinking you might want to bring me an [Anfibio Multibag](http://www.packrafting-store.de/Christmas-Sale/Anfibio-Multibag-40l::549.html) to keep my spare clothes dry, an [Anfibio Throwbag](http://www.packrafting-store.de/Safety/Anfibio-Throwbag::415.html) in case I need to rescue my partner and an [Anfibio Mobile Case](http://www.packrafting-store.de/Raftpacks/Anfibio-Mobile-case::550.html) so my phone stays dry in the cold and wet environment. It's all for safety and multi-use, and also will see action when I'm out backpacking. With that my winter packrafting adventure should be safe & fun - exactly how it should be!

Sincerely yours,


The Ultralighter
