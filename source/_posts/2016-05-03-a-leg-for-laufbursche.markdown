Mateusz, backpacker and manufacturer of the ultralight [LAUFBURSCHE](http://www.ilovelaufbursche.de/english/) backpacks, lost a leg in his battle against cancer. With this fundraiser I want to help him pay his medical bills and hopefully get a prosthesis that allows him to go hiking again. [**Updated with winner!**]

Mateusz and I met the first time six years ago when he joined a group of ultralight backpackers who followed my invite for an [Ultralight Winter trip](https://hikinginfinland.com/2010/02/tufwt-1-0-trip-report.html). We hiked, laughed, camped in the snow, went to Sauna and jumped into the ice hole together, and have been in contact ever since. I was lucky enough to get one of the very first 40D black Silnylon huckePACKs, a design which was back then and still today is revolutionary. As an Architect Mateusz has a great eye for functional design, and his backpacks are considered far and wide works of art. My "Packing your framless backpack - LAUFBURSCHE huckePACK" video is probably my most-watched video on Youtube, and it is that backpack which I today will to raffle off in support of Mateusz.

As a fellow entrepreneuer I know that should sickness strike then shit hits the fan, and it's sadly not different for Mateusz. Many other's have written about his condition so I do not want to concentrate on it here, but instead send good vibes and support his way and a one-of-a-kind LAUFBURSCHE huckePACK your way. The pack is in great condition without any damage, is made of black 40d Silynlon with an XPAC floor, is Size L (which fits me at 175 cm very well) and weighs with all the straps attached 343 g. I guesstimate the volume at around 35 to 45 l, so it's a great size for a week long trip in the mountains or woods.

*So, how do you get a chance on winning this backpack AND help Mateusz?* 

- One lottery ticket costs 5€, and you can buy as many as you'd like. More tickets obviously increase your chances to win this unique pack and help Mateusz more!

## Update 23.05.2016

Wow, what a great effort! There were donations for a total of 201 lottery tickets, with some donations which didn't want to enter, which raised a grand total of 1.295 € for Mateusz! I imagine that helps him with getting a ultralight carbon or titanium part for his prosthesis! The winner of the huckePACK has already been contacted and I hope she will enjoy hiking with the pack =)

Of course we don't need to stop now - Mateusz is still battling with the complications of his sickness, and you can still [donate](http://www.ilovelaufbursche.de/english/) to support him. Every small donation helps, so just drink one less fancy coffee and donate that sum instead =)

*Disclaimer: I have no financial benefit in this campaign. Mateusz is a friend of mine and I want to help him pay his medical bills & hike again in the future.*
