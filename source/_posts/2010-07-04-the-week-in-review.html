It is July, summer is in full swing and there is a lot going on in the lightweight and UL community. The weather is perfect here in Finland, long, sunny and hot days - I hope to go out on a trip soon. <br /><br /><embed src="http://media1.nfb.ca/medias/flash/ONFflvplayer-gama.swf" width="516" height="337" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="mID=IDOBJ348&image=http://media1.nfb.ca/medias/nfb_tube/thumbs_large/2008/787_5TVBIG.jpg&width=516&height=337&showWarningMessages=false&streamNotFoundDelay=15&lang=en&getPlaylistOnEnd=true&embeddedMode=true"></embed><br /><br />It is Sunday noon, so before you go and watch the above movie make yourself a cup of tea, some sandwiches and take some cookies along as you will not want to interrupt the one hour movie. It is about <a href="http://www.nfb.ca/film/Cesars_Bark_Canoe/">how to build a birch bark canoe</a>, the old way. No spoken words mean you just can enjoy looking and taking in the sounds. Fantastic.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/4JNz7guJkj1CN4KrcCRX-3ZMP1PuexCSr-lw5bI3W3A?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S5QCha8TN7I/AAAAAAAABzc/hVVgkuerdYk/s800/IMG_6244.JPG" /></a><br /><br />Talking trip reports, Gustav found the time to write his view on our Vålådalen trip, and he has some fantastic photos in his <a href="http://thebearablelightness.blogspot.com/2010/07/scandinavian-blogger-meetup-2010-trip.html">trip report</a> and also is able to name all the streams and mountains!<br /><br />Wondering what it feels like to walk on the Pacific Crest Trail? Check out Keith's <a href="http://keithfoskett.blogspot.com/2010/06/gomez-meadow-i-struggled-to-stop-in.html">thoughts on Gomez Meadow</a> or why he feels guilty to be walking. <br /><br />So what is the perspective of someone from the UK (or Scotland!) to go hiking in the Nordics? That is what Jörgen asked <a href="http://www.fjaderlatt.se/2010/07/scandinavia-end-to-end-with-townsend.html">Chris Townsend, who walked the Scandinavian spine</a> twenty years ago. Go have a read of this great article.<br /><br />Caro & Tomie were preparing for the Fjällräven Classic with <a href="http://www.cathohi.de/home/2010/06/jurasteig-55km-vorbereitung-fur-die-fjallraven-classics">a walk on the Jurasteig</a>, and their superb photos show that one doesn't always need to travel far to enjoy nice scenery.<br /><br />James shows us the lush green hills and the blue sea around <a href="http://backpackingbongos.wordpress.com/2010/07/03/beinn-na-croise-isle-of-mull/">Beinn na Croise on the Isle of Mull</a> and reminds us to eat fish and chips only there where you're save from seagulls!<br /><br />Michelle shares with us her trip on the <a href="http://freespirittraveler.blogspot.com/2010/06/mount-seymour-dog-mountain-trail.html">Dog Mountain Trail on Mount Seymour</a>, and the photos look like they could come right out of Tolkien book - Magic!<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/ewCSO9gChD9lJOliR9-6tADlCYIKAPW8x6Ga1mQZ8IM?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/Sriqhikvc8I/AAAAAAAAAfY/GaI1AtPO8lE/s800/Mist_02.JPG" /></a><br /><br />Gear, one thing that sent ripples through the German UL community was <a href="http://trekking-ultraleicht.de/forum/viewthread.php?forum_id=2&thread_id=1212">LAUFBURSCHE's XUL packing list</a> with a Full Skin Out - Base Weight of 2268g. What is really fantastic about this list is that the majority of items are MYOG and thus LAUFBURSCHE knows pretty well where the limits of this list are. Great, inspiring stuff!<br /><br />Shed Dweller shares his <a href="http://sheddwellersmoments.blogspot.com/2010/06/lakes-sul-trip-few-thoughts.html">thoughts on the gear</a> he used on his recent (S)UL trip to the Lakes, so if you wonder if it is possible to go so light and still be safe and comfortable, please have a look.<br /><br />Thomas shares his <a href="http://goinglighter.blogspot.com/2010/06/first-impression-ti-caldera-keg-h.html">initial impressions on the Ti Caldera Keg-H</a> with us, and for everyone who fancies cooking with a beer can and a woodfire this is required reading.<br /><br />If you prefer titanium pots for cooking with a wood fire on the other hand, have a look at <a href="http://thunderinthenight.blogspot.com/2010/07/four-dog-stoves-bushcooker-lt1-stove.html">Joe's first look at the Bushcooker LT1</a> (and also at the accompanying <a href="http://thunderinthenight.blogspot.com/2010/06/not-risk-another-frontal-assault-that.html">Evernew Titanium Pasta Pot review</a>!), which is something to consider if you want to go (S)UL.<br /><br />Nibe, who walks in the Dutch mountains (!) shares his <a href="http://inthedutchmountains.blogspot.com/2010/06/last-weekend-part-one-gear.html">thoughts on his gear from his last trip</a>, and it is interesting for all those who are lightening up and trying lightweight gear one step at the time.<br /><br />Showing that 24h trips and lightweight/ UL gear are not exclusive to backpackers, we here see that <a href="http://vintageone.blogspot.com/2010/07/s24o-with-jeffj-and-ted.html">Sub 24hour Overnighters with lightweight gear</a> are also common in the cycling community. <br /><br />And in case you haven't yet read my <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/06/gossamer-gear-spinntwinn-review-video.html">Gossamer Gear SpinnTwinn review</a> and video, please go and have a look if you're in the market for a tarp!<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/IDKXgLkU_UuFPLPizZ67X3ZMP1PuexCSr-lw5bI3W3A?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S5QCjNNKx9I/AAAAAAAABzo/aSOojrNoANw/s800/IMG_6328.JPG" /></a><br /><br />If you forget your pot on a trip in the future but don't want to go without your cup of tea or a hot meal, check out Nick's <a href="http://www.skillsforwildlives.com/2010/07/boiling-water-in-a-birch-bark-container/">how to boil water in a birch bark container</a>, learn the skills and in future you can go without your titanium pot hiking, saving another 100 g.<br /><br />Japan has a very active UL scene, and some very worthy note-worthy Shops: <a href="http://locusgear.com/">Locus Gear</a>, <a href="http://moonlight-gear.com/">Moonlight Gear</a> and the <a href="http://ulgstore.exblog.jp/">ulgear weekend store</a>. While Locus Gear is a cottage manufacturer and a shop, the last two are dedicated UL shops. I really like the layout of Moonlight Gear, it is beautiful! ulgear weekend store on the other hand is a a shop and blog, and the owner always makes very interesting posts with lots of photos - often from cottage gear! So if you're located in Japan and need some new UL toys, support these shops!<br /><br />The <a href="http://hrxxlight.com/?p=247">view into LAUFBURSCHE's workshop</a> which Benjamin gave us already wetted the appetite of the up coming launch of the company. Bets are being made how many hours it will take that the company will be sold out of its initial stock after opening - if you want to take part, leave a comment here with your guess ;) <br /><br />And by now you know that I love Japan. It was thus with gusto that I read Hamilton's latest article, Which asks "<a href="http://traversejapan.wordpress.com/2010/07/03/do-you-need-permission-to-play-outside/">Do You Need Permission to Enjoy Nature?</a>" and is a absolute fantastic piece, which showcases how different our (backpacking) cultures are. For everyone who is hiking in Japan or by the tiniest bit interested in the country a must read.<br /><br /><a href="http://flattr.com/thing/985/Hiking-in-Finland-Ultralight-Backpacking-Blog" target="_blank"><img src="http://api.flattr.com/button/button-compact-static-100x17.png" title="Flattr this" border="0" /></a></div>
