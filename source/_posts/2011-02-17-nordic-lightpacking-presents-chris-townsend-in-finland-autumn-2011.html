Yes, you read that right. <a href="http://www.christownsendoutdoors.com/"target="_blank">Chris Townsend</a>, author of many books on long-distance trekking and lightweight backpacking, TGO Gear Editor, and President of the Mountaineering Council of Scotland is coming to Finland. <br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/mEWmErRSoeLPasKrD11bWjWiupv70N-RGKSfyQFBX78?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TUb8YoOZj5I/AAAAAAAAD6E/2C6EZGXGUUk/s800/Self-portrait-2.jpg" height="600" width="453" /></a><br />Chris on the Pacific Northwest Trail, summer 2010.<br /><br />Together with my <a href="http://www.nordiclightpacking.com/"target="_blank">Nordic Lightpacking</a> friends we are bringing Chris over to Finland, for a walk and talk. We are in the early planning stages and will keep you updated on the specifics such as date and time, tough if you're interested you should keep early September free of any commitments so that you can join us. <br /><br />The idea is that Chris will hold a presentation on long-distance backpacking and lightweight equipment, and with decades of experience it will be an interesting presentation, illustrated by Chris' own photographs. Besides the presentation there will be a hike of a couple of days (three to six) in a yet to be determined area, so you might want to take your tarp, quilt and backpack along as well. <br /><br />We are very excited and grateful that Chris has agreed to come and help us spread the lightweight backpacking ideas here in the Nordics, and believe that it will be an excellent opportunity for all interested in long-distance and lightweight backpacking to meet up for a few interesting days in the beautiful Finnish forests. Mark your calendars and stay tuned - this is something you don't want to miss!</div>
