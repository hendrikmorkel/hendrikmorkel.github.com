Dear Santa,

"And it burns, burns, burns, the Ring of Fire, the Ring of Fire". It's a classic song, and every time I want to boil water I wish I would have a [Mini Ring of Fire with integrated stand](http://www.outdoortrailgear.com/featured/mini-ring-of-fire-alcohol-stove/) from [Smokeeater908](http://www.outdoortrailgear.com/cottage-industries/smokeeater908/smokeeater908-store/). Not just the name is like in the song, nope, this light 37 g stove has air vents cut in the bottom and with the adjustable base you can control the amount of heat the stove puts out - it's like the knob at home with which you can control your stove, just in a sweet little outdoor stove. Best of all, with the vents closed you can bake with it - Yes, that means Muffins for breakfast! The Mini Ring of Fire comes with or without a integrated stand, but always along is the fuel line, nipple cap and a 4oz fuel bottle. A small, light and versatile package, which is excellent for lightpackers!

Sincerely yours,


An aspiring lightpacker
