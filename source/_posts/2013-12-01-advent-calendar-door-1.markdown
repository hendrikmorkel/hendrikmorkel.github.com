Dear Santa,

It's the start of the season and after the [Kick-off](http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/11/annual-day-zero-hif-advent-calendar-kick-off.html) I now truly and honestly am looking forward to our daily communications. It's the 1st of December, and with the limited time available this month I only will be able to get away on day trips. A [KS Daypack](http://www.ks-ultralightgear.com/p/ks-daypack.html) from [KS Ultralight Gear](http://www.ks-ultralightgear.com/p/ks-daypack.html) with its centre zipper would be the perfect pack for day trips, as its easy to access gear on the inside while snacks, water and a windjacket will fit in the outside pockets. It also works well on longer trips, as it packs in its own mesh pocket. With this lightweight backpack - just 135 g! - the day trips in December will be truly ultralight!

Sincerely yours,


An aspiring lightpacker,
