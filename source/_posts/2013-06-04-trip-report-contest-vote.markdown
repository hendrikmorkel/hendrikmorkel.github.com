Probably everyone was outdoors backpacking and climbing or was intimidated by the haiku challenge - as there were just two entries! Read them both - they're great, inspiring reads - and then leave a comment with your favourite one.

Luke's [A Snowy "Epic" in Grayson Highlands a.k.a Two Idiot Brothers on a Trip](http://www.backpackinglight.com/cgi-bin/backpackinglight/forums/thread_display.html?forum_thread_id=75319).

Peter's [Spring overnighter with the kids](http://www.yetirides.com/2013/04/spring-overnighter-with-kids.html).

Voting is open till Sunday, 9th of June, Noon Finnish time. On Sunday afternoon I will tally up the comments* and announce the winner in the next TWIR. Happy reading and good luck!

<sub><sup><sub><sup>* I will check IP address on odd looking comments and they might disqualified. It's best to use your nickname/ real name when commenting.</sup></sub></sup></sub>
