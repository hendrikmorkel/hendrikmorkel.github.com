Dear Santa,

[Eifel Outdoor Equipment](http://www.eoe-europe.com) is a small business from close by the Eifel, a low mountain range in western Germany and eastern Belgium. They offer light stoves and pots, and their [Lithium stove](http://www.eoe-europe.com/Produkte/Kocher/Lithium/lithium.html) is probably one of the lightest stoves on the planet - just 44 g heavy! - and thus high on an Ultralighter's wishlist like mine. What's even cooler about the stove is the tiny pack-size - folded together it's the size of my thumb! No wonder I need to check multiple times if I packed it when I head out and it boils a litre of water in just four minutes. I promise to offer you a fast cup of tea if you bring me this stove on Christmas, OK Santa?

Sincerely yours,


The Ultralighter
