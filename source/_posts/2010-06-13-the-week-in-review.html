While I am at the <a href="http://www.riihimaenmessut.fi/en/">Riihim√§ki Outdoor fair</a> - the biggest Outdoor fair in Finland - and will be searching for lightweight and UL goodies from the Nordic manufacturers, you can lounge in your favourite chair and enjoy what happened this week in the outdoor blogsphere.<br /><br />To start off, you might have realized that I did a little re-design of the site (obviously not if you read it via RSS =). I want the design to be light, easy and less cluttered, just as I like to be on the trail. I sorted some stuff out, and you now can access all <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/p/reviews.html">gear reviews & first looks</a>, the <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/p/interviews.html">interviews</a> and my <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/p/reading-list.html">reading list</a> - which now includes books and the blogroll - via the above links. And I also did a little change to the <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/p/about-faq.html">About / FAQ</a> page, so go check that out if you're of the curious kind!<br /><br />Secondly, I'd like to encourage you to share the content here more - this can easily be done with the share button under each post. Move your mouse over it and choose among Facebook, Twitter, Google, Delicious and other social networks to share it. You can start with this article! If you like the content please feel free to Flattr me - here you can <a href="https://flattr.com/">sign up for Flattr</a> and start using it, it is a great idea and I hope that many more start to use it on their blogs. Finally, an easy way to follow the developments here is to become a Follower by clicking the "Follow" button on the right; that brings the articles here right into your RSS Reader of choice and you let me and others know that you like this site!<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/WtB68R20ajnkS8tWMX9urYhiI5wKU10e5tzMb1Q04iQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TA6NsfPbBPI/AAAAAAAACwA/ucVOieYLjn4/s800/Discussing%2001%20%281%20of%201%29.jpg" /></a><br /><br />Video is the medium of the internet - I have said this before - and Londonbackpacker confirms this with his videos of the <a href="http://londonbackpackers.blogspot.com/2010/06/tgo-challenge-2010-day-seveneight-video.html">TGO Challenge</a>. Really cool stuff, so check them out!<br /><br />The Shed Dweller took his boys out <a href="http://sheddwellersmoments.blogspot.com/2010/06/woodland-wild-camp.html">for fishing and wildcamping</a>, and it looks like they had fun.<br /><br />Minimalgear took his son and wife on a <a href="http://minimalgear.blogspot.com/2010/06/solomons-first-trip.html">family trip</a>, with them the Tarptent Hogback, and realized that UL is perfect for such occasions.<br /><br />Knilch, MYOG-man extraordinaire, has little time but the time he has he spends <a href="http://ultraknilch.blogspot.com/2010/06/neue-rubrik-foto-des-tages.html">running up mountains behind his house</a>. Nice weather, great view.<br /><br />Trailblaze went on a five day trip to Knoydart in Scotland, and reports about swamps, lochs and mountains <a href="http://www.trailblaze.de/schottland-knoydart.html">in his trip report</a>.<br /><br />Also the Auld Blug went on a <a href="http://bluggery.blogspot.com/2010/06/scotland.html">trip to Scotland</a> and took along his DIY kajak Sedna - what a beautiful boat!<br /><br />Do you like clouds, mountains, interesting rock formations, wildlife and waterfalls, all with plenty of sunshine? Then check out Down The Trail's trip in <a href="http://www.downthetrail.com/grand-canyon/hiking-upstream-in-phantom-creek-and-the-miners-route/">Phantom Creek and the Miners Route</a>, which is fantastic.<br /><br />James from Backpackingbongos did a <a href="http://backpackingbongos.wordpress.com/2010/06/09/backpacking-the-rhinogs-a-south-to-north-traverse/">south to north traverse of the Rhinogs</a> and the scenery was epic while the findings were Metal!<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/WM-B9sx8-w62PiX9wv0iea3_ZFCDtugbu0uvLrhUYgM?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TAvbFnuHsCI/AAAAAAAACtc/3nKPrAM2AKo/s800/P1020234.JPG" /></a><br /><br />In the gear department video is also on the advance, this week Darren gave us <a href="http://whitespider1066.com/2010/06/stove-talk-episode-5/">Episode five of his Stove Talk</a> which is about the Vargo Titanium Woodburning stove.<br /><br />Richard has a look at the <a href="http://maceachain.blogspot.com/2010/06/worlds-lightest-gas-stove-gosystem-fly.html">GoSystems Fly Ti</a> and wonders if it is the worlds lightest gas stove, while Roger tested the <a href="http://www.nielsenbrownoutdoors.com/2010/06/monatauk-gnat-update.html">Monatauk Gnat</a> and got pretty similar numbers. The smart person knows that it is one and the same stove just with a different brand written on it, as <a href="http://lighthiker.wordpress.com/2010/06/10/monatauk-gnat-vs-fire-maple-fms-116t/">Roman points out</a>.<br /><br />New tent needed? Maz, new to the blogsphere (Go say welcome!), reviewed his <a href="http://www.journeymantraveller.com/2010/06/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul1-and-seedhouse.html">Big Agnes Fly Creek UL1 and Seedhouse SL1</a> and compared it to the Vaude Power Lizard.<br /><br />Joe wrote a review on the <a href="http://thunderinthenight.blogspot.com/2010/06/inov8-terroc-330-shoe-review.html">Inov-8 Terroc 330</a> and concluded that he would buy a pair again if this one went broke today, so go read his reasoning!<br /><br />And also I did a short review on the <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/06/gear-that-worked-and-gear-that-didnt-ii.html">gear that worked and the gear that didn't</a> while being in Sweden. A good discussion going on there, please join in!<br /><br />And also in the "Others" section, Video reigns supreme as this one shows: <br /><br /><object width="640" height="505"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/zwmwxkD86Ec&hl=en_US&fs=1&color1=0x234900&color2=0x4e9e00"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/zwmwxkD86Ec&hl=en_US&fs=1&color1=0x234900&color2=0x4e9e00" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="505"></embed></object><br /><br />Dressed in Dirt gives us some insights on <a href="http://www.dressedindirt.com/2010/06/why-you-should-hike-in-a-skirt-or-at-least-think-about-it/">why we should hike in a skirt - or at least think about it</a>. If pee-ability is something you're looking for, give it a read.<br /><br />If Bushcraft is your thing, I reckon this Guide on "<a href="http://wildelycreative.wordpress.com/2010/05/24/how-to-make-primitive-kilns/">How to make primitive kilns</a>" is right up your alley.

And while you're there, give Hamilton some <a href="http://traversejapan.wordpress.com/2010/06/04/gimme-shelter/">feedback on his shelter</a>, will ya?!<br /><br />Finally, inspired by the <a href="http://www.nordiclightpacking.com/">Nordic Fellowship of lightweight & UL bloggers</a>, hrXXLight has some <a href="http://hrxxlight.com/?p=353">thoughts on creating a European scene</a> - maybe you want to let him know your opinion on that matter?<br /><br /><a href="http://flattr.com/thing/985/Hiking-in-Finland-Ultralight-Backpacking-Blog" target="_blank"><img src="http://api.flattr.com/button/button-compact-static-100x17.png" title="Flattr this" border="0" /></a></div>
