However, my diligent research has shown that <a href="http://terrarosagear.com/"target="_blank">Terra Rosa Gear</a> make a rather good and affordable <a href="http://www.terrarosagear.com/quiltbagcover.htm"target="_blank">quilt/ sleeping bag cover</a> from tyvek - a material which the highly enlightened folks rate very high. If I would get this one, I will go out and sleep under the night sky; and also will be able to keep up in the conversations with my hiking buddies (Now I'm just sitting there silently zipping from my Platypus when the talk turns to sleeping without shelter). <br /><br />Best,<br /><br /><br /><i>- An aspiring UL Backpacker</i><br /><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/XdcQ7pdwERNkT6NFBKRHmmiBcik-iSu3FtqWq-IAnas?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-sMDW6MWjRtw/TtZVzxvkBaI/AAAAAAAAFmw/THK3CG090pI/s640/DSC01591.JPG" height="426" width="640" /></a><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/nUs4wAkB9S-728HY6D-YWmiBcik-iSu3FtqWq-IAnas?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-MntEUO5EbYg/TtZV1lrdNQI/AAAAAAAAFm0/EHWcSQwpat0/s640/DSC01592.JPG" height="426" width="640" /></a><br /><br />Leave a comment with a photo of your sleeping setup (so quilt/ sleeping bag + pad/ inflatable mat + whatever else you have) and tell us where you wanna use the Terra Rosa Gear Quilt Cover.<br /><br /><b>UPDATE I</b><br /><br />Thanks everyone, some sweet setups and trip plans there. <i>And the winner is</i>...
