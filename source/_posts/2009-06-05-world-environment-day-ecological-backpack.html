<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">Today is World Environment Day, and the theme of the day is "Your Planet Needs You!" Its also the day that the magnificent HOME movie is released, for free in over 50 countries and on </span><a href="http://www.youtube.com/homeproject"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">Youtube</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">. Its a spectacular film from Yann Arthus-Bertrand, who you might know from his photographs and book "The World from Above". Watch the HOME trailer here, and for the full movie follow the above link - you won't be disappointed!<br /><br /></span><object width="560" height="340"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/G8IozVfph7I&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x234900&amp;color2=0x4e9e00"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/G8IozVfph7I&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x234900&amp;color2=0x4e9e00" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="560" height="340"></embed></object><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"><br /><br />Because most of us [UL] backpackers try to minimize the weight on our backs, I find the Ecological backpack tool from </span><a href="http://www.onedidit.com/"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">One did it</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"> very useful. This tool, which is free and very easy to use, helps us to a) realize which size our ecological backpack is, and b) to minimize it. The latter is possible with useful, daily Eco-tips. I therefore would hope that a lot of the readers here take up my challenge and measure their own ecological backpack, and show it off on their blogs and websites. Here my backpack:<br /><br /></span><a href="http://onedidit.com/profile/puElQ9of9h2rWWqdPLRE"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"><img src="http://onedidit.com/images/badge/927" alt="My eco-backpack" /></span></a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"><br /><br />The idea behind this is simple: We backpackers and hikers love to walk in pristine nature, take photos of wildlife and wild camp in beautiful spots far off civilization. To protect this landscapes is in our interest, and the ecological backpack is a good step to raise the awareness that our world is currently at a turning point. We as individuals can not stop global warming, but together we can voice our concerns and make business and politics act in our interest and rescue our planet.<br /><br />So while I am far off getting my base weight down to 10 kg, I am confident that my ecological backpack is very low, and I am curious to see if there are fellow hikers and backpackers out there who can go below my weight!</span></div>
