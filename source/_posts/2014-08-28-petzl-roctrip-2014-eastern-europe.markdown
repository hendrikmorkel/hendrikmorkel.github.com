Romania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Greece and Turkey are host to the 2014 Petzl RocTrip which this year takes the form of a road trip. Come and join this great event and hang out with the likes of [Ueli Steck](http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/08/ueli-steck-interview.html), Saïd Belhaj, Dave Graham, Mélissa Le Nevé, Nina Caprez and many more while exploring the crazy good climbing that can be had in Eastern Europe!

The first time I became aware of the [Petzl RocTrip](http://www.petzl-roctrip.com/en) was in 2011, when I saw some photos from the event in China. Then in 2012 the video of the event was published and it was mind-blowing. I still love to watch it, and if you have a moment watch it here.

In 2013 the Petzl RocTrip traveled to [Argentina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QllWNEGBKic) and it was equally inspiring. In 2013 it returned closer to home to the Gorges du Tarn, and now in 2014 the event is back and takes a new, unique format: A road trip across five countries in Eastern Europe. This is a great idea on so many levels, as it promotes what climbing is about in many ways: Travel to new crags, explore new countries, meet new people, climb new types of rock, experience different cultures. In a way it is promoting the dirtbag lifestyle, in a slightly more comfortable way! The teaser sets the mood well:

What is special about the RocTrip are the low costs for taking part in the event: It's just 15€! Comparing that to the costs of some other events this is *very affordable*. It's well organized ([check the practical information](http://www.petzl-roctrip.com/en/practical-information)) and you get the opportunity to climb in some unique locations with members of the [Petzl Pro Team](http://www.petzl-roctrip.com/en/news/spend-time-your-favorite-athletes-during-2014-petzl-roctrip). 

Interested? Then [pre-register until August 31th, 2014](http://www.petzl-roctrip.com/en/join-us) to one (or all!) of the camps you would like to join. [Organize your transportation](http://www.petzl-roctrip.com/en/practical-information#Transport), for example join the carpool or get a ride in the Petzl bus. Book your flights (I'm flying to Antalya which is a smooth connection if flying from Helsinki, Stockholm or Oslo). Then start your [climbing training](http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/06/gimme-kraft.html) so you're fit for the hundreds of routes which will be waiting for you! The Petzl Roctrip website has a lot more information available, so check it out, pick the locations you want to join and pre-register! 

I will be joining the Roctrip on the last two stops in [Geyikbayiri](http://www.petzl-roctrip.com/en/base-camp/geyikbayiri-turkish-style-columns) and [Olympos](http://www.petzl-roctrip.com/en/base-camp/olympos-climb-sky-fall-water) and you'll be able to read about it here and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/hikinginfinland). But I really hope to meet some of you in Turkey =)
