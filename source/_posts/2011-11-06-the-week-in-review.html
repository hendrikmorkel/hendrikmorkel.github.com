I hate November in Finland. It is by far the most miserable and grey month, and I decided that this will be the last November I will have spent in Finland. Next year I will swap this grey misery of fog and no sunshine to a month at the beach or mountains or rainforest or all of the aforementioned, somewhere in the south where the sun shines and the sky is blue. There shall be possibilities for hiking, climbing and biking as well, besides lounging at the beach. After some time googling for ecological holiday homes and only finding rubbish a friend recommended me <a href="http://www.airbnb.com/tell-a-friend?airef=w3kpza02eczz5"target="_blank">Airbnb</a>. I had a look at the site, checked available accommodations at our preferred destinations, and it definitely looks like the way to go. So if you're equally fed up with grey, foggy, depressive, snowless Novembers in you neck of the world, check out  <a href="http://www.airbnb.com/tell-a-friend?airef=w3kpza02eczz5"target="_blank">Airbnb</a>. <br /><br /><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/16442800?color=ffffff" width="440" height="248" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen allowFullScreen></iframe><br /><br />Darren lives in Australia. Australia is totally a country where I could picture myself living. Their Novembers are not grey & depressive. Not at all, as Darren shows on his <a href="http://djm74.blogspot.com/2011/11/packrafting-shoalhaven-river.html"target="_blank">packrafting the shoalhaven river</a> trip.<br /><br />John is walking the GR7 at the moment, and it took him to <a href="http://e4longdistancewalk.blogspot.com/2011/11/stage-3-gr7-through-murcia.html"target="_blank">Murcia</a> last week. The sun shines also in Spain.<br /><br />Nick <a href="http://www.invertedworld.co.uk/blog/2011/11/welcoming-back-greenwich-mean-time-on-scolty-hill/"target="_blank">welcomes back Greenwich Mean Time on Scolty Hill</a>.<br /><br />The 2012 Ultralight Backpackers Summit will be held in Slovenia, as decided by the majority of people who voted - Awesome =) Now <a href="http://ultralightsummit.com/2011/10/31/the-polls-are-closed/"target="_blank">lets find a date which suits most of us</a>. Please go and <a href="http://www.doodle.com/smbrqiz62xa88cpv"target="_blank">choose your preferred date in the Doodle calendar</a> before the hobbits, dwarfs and elves behind this continue planning!<br /><br />David's mate took some <a href="http://www.selfpowered.net/2011/11/smorgasboard-of-gentle-adventuring.html"target="_blank">fine photo on the HRP</a>.<br /><br />Dave discusses <a href="http://ultralighter.blogspot.com/2011/11/backpacking-in-or-out.html"target="_blank">In Or Out</a>?<br /><br />Jack shows us a <a href="http://velohobo.com/2011/11/05/free-ultralight-wood-burning-stove/"target="_blank">free, UL wood stove</a>.<br /><br />Alan had <a href="http://alanrayneroutdoors.blogspot.com/2011/10/sad-sensible-and-greendale-tarn-oh-and.html"target="_blank">a wet walk on Greendale Tarn</a>. Quite nice photos of a soggy hike.<br /><br />John had a bit more luck with the weather on his <a href="http://jdburland.blogspot.com/2011/11/around-troutbeck-and-gowbarrow.html"target="_blank">hike around Troutbeck and Gowbarrow</a>.<br /><br />Cole continues to produce fine photos of his trips, and his latest <a href="http://colestrailtales.blogspot.com/2011/09/lassen-national-park-trip-report-day-1.html"target="_blank">Lassen National Park trip report</a> is no exception.<br /><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/BDZ0HETMC-gkp224IRGLmjWiupv70N-RGKSfyQFBX78?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-cneGkYoZOBY/TragfLkSJ5I/AAAAAAAAFf4/v1iBcDK3h64/s800/Autumn.JPG" height="800" width="600" /></a><br /><br />You see, I would like November in Finland slightly better if there would not be the retarded day light saving BS-thing, and instead of greyness I could do with snow. Snow like Ryan had it on his <a href="http://guthook.blogspot.com/2011/10/snowy-stratton-102911.html"target="_blank">Snowy Stratton daytrip</a>.<br /><br />James shares <a href="http://glencoemountaineer.blogspot.com/2011/11/some-thoughts-on-soloing-posted-by.html"target="_blank">some thoughts on soloing</a>.<br /><br />Kinpu continues to post superb MYOG articles. His latest article shows how he made a <a href="http://lamarcheasuivre.blogspot.com/2011/11/sac-dos-concept-prototype-en-tyvec.html"target="_blank">backpack prototype out of tyvek</a> - which has the advantage of being easy to work with and cheap. Inspiring!<br /><br />Linda spent a <a href="http://photomomlinda.blogspot.com/2011/10/weekend-in-bend.html"target="_blank">weekend in Bend</a>.<br /><br />I interview <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2011/11/interview-sean-clayton-of-oookworks.html"target="_blank">Sean of OookWorks</a>, the UK's only cottage manufacturer, and a great guy.<br /><br />Karl shares some <a href="http://livefreeandhikenh.blogspot.com/2011/11/some-history-on-iron-mountain.html"target="_blank">history of Iron Mountain</a>.<br /><br />Beth shares <a href="http://ourappalachia.blogspot.com/2011/10/i-just-had-to-do-one-more-post-on.html"target="_blank">the gorgeous view</a> of autumn forests in Appalachia.<br /><br />Thinking about walking John O'Groats to Land's End? Read <a href="http://christine-on-big-trip.blogspot.com/2011/11/john-ogroats-to-lands-end-conclusion.html"target="_blank">Christine's Conclusion of her JOGLE</a> and you might reconsider it. Or possibly she should have read Mike's <a href="http://www.ukhillwalking.com/articles/page.php?id=2923"target="_blank">Successful Long Distance Path Walking</a> article beforehand.<br /><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Lk0IGB6p-rtPUJbDTHKV9ZaRYsR4KT_8jKEdg9tkUtU?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-uEH-zOeLEHg/TiwYmYvTucI/AAAAAAAAFBg/LdrT7qgw3wM/s800/P1030334.jpg" height="600" width="800" /></a><br /><br />Ken is currently in Turkey. Turkey is the beautiful country between the Mediterranean and Black Sea. It also has beautiful Novembers. Ken's account of his hikes around the country are well worth your time, and his <a href="http://awanderingknight.blogspot.com/2011/10/turkey-day-4-ephesus.html"target="_blank">Ephesus</a> account will delight the history and archeology fans among you.<br /><br />If you like grey and soggy weather, I reckon you will love Scotland. James seems to like <a href="http://backpackingbongos.wordpress.com/2011/11/05/bothy-vagabonds-in-the-far-north-pt1-ben-armine/"target="_blank">Scotland, and Bothys</a>. I wonder if he was disappointed by the sun and blue sky, which occasionally seemed to come through.<br /><br />If you like racing, backpacking, and a combination of both, check out the inaugural <a href="http://bedrockandparadox.wordpress.com/bob-marshall-wilderness-open/"target="_blank">Bob Marshall Wilderness Open</a> which Dave is putting together.<br /><br />A <a href="http://lacemine29.blogspot.com/2011/11/whistler-2011.html"target="_blank">MTB park video</a>. From this Mike guy, which takes awesome photos and makes <a href="http://lacemine29.com/"target="_blank">sweet 29" wheels</a>.<br /><br />Markus not only makes gorgeous knifes - you should <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/hendrikmorkel/status/132202839635275776"target="_blank">see my new UL blade</a> - but also likes to go high and far. His <a href="http://ultraknilch.blogspot.com/2011/11/trettachspitze-und-hofatsuberschreitung.html"target="_blank">Trettachspitze and Höfatsüberschreitung</a> photos and report are well worth seeing and reading.<br /><br />Enjoyed TWIR?
