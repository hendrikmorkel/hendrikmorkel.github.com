<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">This time just a short one nighter. Leaving on Saturday at noon with some mates from <a href="http://www.couchsurfing.org/">Couchsurfing</a>. Walking right out of the city for about 11 km, where we stay at a small lake where there is a lean-to shelter. I take the tent, and with the promised rain for both days the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/2009/08/gear-talk-tarptent-scarp-1-initial.html">Scarp 1</a>, the <a href="http://www.trekmates.co.uk/842/Trekmates-Amphibian-Gore-Tex-Shell-Sock-.html">Trekmates Amphibian socks</a> and the <a href="http://www.rab.uk.com/clothing/shell/new_momentum_jacket---131/">Rab Momentum Jacket</a> and <a href="http://www.rab.uk.com/clothing/shell/new_drillium_pants---133/">Drillium Pants</a> will come in handy and show what they're made of! With the help of <a href="http://armchair-adventurer.blogspot.com/">Dave</a> I shaved some more grams from my backpack, and am now under 10 kg for the one night including food, water and the DSLR. Its also the first night out for the <a href="http://www.golite.com/Product/ProdDetail.aspx?p=SS7500&mc=181&t=&lat=">GoLite Ultra 20Â°</a> and the Smartwool Microweight <a href="https://www.smartwool.com/#/Mens/Apparel/Baselayer/Microweight/2026/">Zip T</a> and <a href="https://www.smartwool.com/#/Mens/Apparel/Baselayer/Microweight/2514/">bottoms</a>, so there's gonna be some initial reviews on these next week.<br /><br />Because I literally walk out of the city I can be so experimental with the clothes - in case something goes wrong I am not more than a few kilometers to the next road and a taxi ride from home, where I can jump in the Sauna and a warm shower =) Here is the packing list for the weekend, let me know what you think:<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Gpy7B5Jg9heFgS6lT5U6hQ?authkey=Gv1sRgCN6g8cTAg5HhTQ&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/SqDdYjTctyI/AAAAAAAAAUE/JX3Kd8p5sDs/s800/packinglist_hervanta_valkeakoski.jpg" /></a><br /><br />Have a nice weekend!</span></div>
