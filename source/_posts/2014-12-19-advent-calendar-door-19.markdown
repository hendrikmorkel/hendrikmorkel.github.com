Dear Santa,

the [skinbased](http://skinbased.com) skis from [OAC Sport](http://www.oacsport.fi) are a combination of a Nordic backcountry ski, a telemark/ touring ski and a snowshoe - which means they're faster than snowshoes and easier to learn than normal skis. I came to the conclusion that for my backcountry adventures the [KAR 147](http://skinbased.com/7/) would be ideal. It's a wide and short ski, with a tip that always stays on top of the snow and on the way down it also has good edge control in packed snow. It's agile when skiing and skinning up through forests - and fast! It's so much faster than walking with snowshoes, and not just on the way up - on the way down you can have a lot of fun while making your turns and then establish the basecamp! Really great is the new OAC EA Binding: You can use it with almost any shoe or boot, which makes it ideal for winter skiing beginners as you can use your normal hiking boots and don't need to get skiing boots. With these under my feet, Santa, I think I am ready for winter backpacking trips in the snow!

Sincerely yours,


The Ultralighter
