Goof-off Tuesday has become Goof-off Wednesday. Embrace the change, let work be work and idle away while thinking about the next <span style="font-weight:bold;">M</span>ake <span style="font-weight:bold;">Y</span>our <span style="font-weight:bold;">O</span>wn <span style="font-weight:bold;">G</span>ear project you'd like to tackle. <br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/BgkA9ombUtulQs35KMdV14MHgGyOf-LgUV-e66qtx1o?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S0i6zvrsX9I/AAAAAAAABSo/5UBVIAzc-r4/s640/IMG_4746.JPG" height="427" width="640" /></a><br />Me sewing my tarp. <br /><br />My next MYOG Project is going to be a anorak and a pants for winter. Yeah, I got some <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/11/rab-demand-pull-on-review.html"target="_blank">nice</a> <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/12/haglofs-ozo-pullover-review.html"target="_blank">hardshells</a> and pants, but for the winter I want something that breaths very well while keeping wind and snow at bay. And after reading "<a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/04/book-corner-snow-walkers-companion-by.html"target="_blank">The Snowwalkers Companion</a>" I made the decision to try natural materials for a change.<br /><br />Inspiration is the first step, and this inspiration comes from <a href="http://barleybreeder.wordpress.com/2009/10/15/myog-etaproof-schlupfanorak/"target="_blank">Barleybreeder</a>, <a href="http://www.nature-base.de/shop/etaproof-jacke2"target="_blank">Jonas from Nature-base.de</a> and the guys from <a href="http://empirecanvasworks.com/"target="_blank">Empire Canvas Works</a>. I saw Jonas' very nice EtaProof jacket as he was here in February, and after reading about the benefits of this natural material I decided that I will give <a href="http://www.extremtextil.de/catalog/advanced_search_result.php?language=en&keywords=etaproof&XTCsid=6220b6ca7eafc97e1c6c00554a748aec"target="_blank">EtaProof</a> a try. I know, I know, you will be thinking "Cotton Kills" and I have this in mind as well. But I will be skiing in -20Â°C and it is going to be dry up in Lapland, so I am not too concerned about wetness. Keeping the wind out is priority number one, while having space to wear a lofty jacket underneath it and being light, highly breathable and comfy. <br /><br />So I will be using <a href="http://www.extremtextil.de/catalog/Naehzubehoer/Schnittmuster/Rainier-Wind-u-Regencombi-f-Maenner-Schnittmuster-GP134::683.html"target="_blank">this pattern</a>, <a href="http://www.extremtextil.de/catalog/advanced_search_result.php?language=en&keywords=EtaProof"target="_blank">EtaProof</a> in the 170g/ qm weight and some other bits and pieces. Ordering at Extremtextil is friendly and fast, and once the goods are here you will be kept up-to-date about how the sewing is coming along =)<br /><br />So what are you waiting for? What is your next MYOG project? A simple <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2009/08/myog-meth-stove.html"target="_blank">meth stove</a>, a backpack, a jacket, tarp? Let us know, and goof-off!</div>
