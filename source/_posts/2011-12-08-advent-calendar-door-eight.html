Titanium is a wonderfully light metal, and all my friends have a titanium cup and pot. Some even use their cups as pots, true multipurpose thinking there, and as a real UL backpacker usually eats out of freezer bags and needs the pot for boiling water only, I think it would be ace if you'd bring me a <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/marken/snow-peak/"target="_blank">SnowPeak</a> 600 Double Wall Titanium Cup from <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/"target="_blank">Bergfreunde</a>. I could first use it to boil water, pour half of it in my freezer bag and use the rest for a fine, warm cup of coffee! It should keep my coffee nice warm even in minus temperatures, and cleaning it should be easy as pie. It also looks great, so I'd appreciate if you think of me when you make the purchase decisions for my presents.<br /><br />Best,<br /><br /><br /><i>- An aspiring UL-Backpacker</i><br /><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/B8gIaF6iG8sBjlIX86M37GiBcik-iSu3FtqWq-IAnas?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-scRZjtlEJa4/TteUXviXEII/AAAAAAAAFno/nmjz-4ChZ1g/s640/Logo_2010_3000.jpg" height="164" width="640" /></a><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/TCWqfZgpJuxac2iBMjHhdmiBcik-iSu3FtqWq-IAnas?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-lSGeQ91M2rc/TtZVsotlssI/AAAAAAAAFmc/y2RCQCXvy5k/s640/DSC01580.JPG" height="426" width="640" /></a><br /><br />Leave a photo of your current cup. You might use it as a pot. But it should be a cup =)<br /><br /><b>UPDATE I</b><br /><br />Thanks everyone. Yes, indeed, you shouldn't use a double walled cup above direct heat. So the winner shouldn't do that, OK? So no boiling water in it, no cheese fondue, no simmering, NADA. Â¿Entiendes?<br /><br /><i>And the winner is</i>... Toni Lund - Congratulations!
