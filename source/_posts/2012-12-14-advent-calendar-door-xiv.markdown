Dear Santa,

I have cold ears. It's windy and cold outside, it snows, and my wooly hat is too heavy. I did my research and found out that the best way to stay warm in this season is with a down hat from [Black Rock Gear](http://blackrockgear.com), called the [Black Rock Hat](http://www.blackrockgear.com/buy.html). It's mighty light and tips the scales at 27 grams in Size Large, that's possible because it is filled with 900 FP goose down, held together by a 15d DWR coated ripstop fabric. In case these terms say nothing to you - it are the lightest, warmest kind of materials, manufactured into an impeccable hat. And with such a fine hat, cold ears, ach, a hold head, is a thing of the past. 

Have a mighty fine weekend, 



*An aspiring UL Backpacker*
