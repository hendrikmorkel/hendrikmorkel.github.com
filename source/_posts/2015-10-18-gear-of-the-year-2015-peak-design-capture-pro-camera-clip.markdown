What is reasonably light, connects to any of my backpacks and is the #1 tool I have along on every trip? It's the Peak Design Capture PRO Camera Clip - my Gear of the Year 2015.

I own a [Peak Design Capture PRO Camera Clip](https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/01/peak-design-capture-pro-camera-clip.html) since over two years and it has been on every trip I have been on in that time, from day packrafting in the Kvarken Archipelago over mountaineering in Chamonix to backpacking in Bosnia and Herzegovina - the Capture PRO has seen it all. When I pack my backpack for a trip, attaching the camera clip to my left shoulder strap is always the first thing I do, and it does not matter if that's a big [Hyperlite Mountain Gear Porter](http://bit.ly/1W1xPjI) or a small [LAUFBURSCHE PACKsack Plus](http://www.laufbursche-gear.de/products/packs/packsack-plus/), the clip fits on any shoulder strap and allows me to have my camera always at the ready.

The [Capture PRO](https://www.peakdesign.com/product/clips/capturepro/?coupon_code=hikeinfin) Clip weighs 113 g and the [Micro Plate](https://www.peakdesign.com/product/clips/microplate?acc=97) weighs 21 g and is a perfect match for any of my smaller cameras, from the compact & ultralight [Sony RX 100 III](https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/02/sony-rx100iii-field-report.html) to the slightly bigger Olympus OM-D E-M5. For even bigger cameras I use the standard ARCAplate Quick Release Plate which tips the scales at a reasonable 29 g and which works great with e.g. the [Sony A7R](https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/10/sony-a7r-field-report.html).

On the trail, in the city and at trade fairs like the OutDoor and ISPO alike my Capture PRO always arouses the interest of fellow outdoor enthusiasts who look for a better way to carry their camera. After two plus years of use & dozens of long trips for me it is clear: It's the [Peak Design Capture PRO Camera Clip](https://www.peakdesign.com/product/clips/capturepro/?acc=97). Because being able to have my camera in my hand in a second or two to not miss a photo opportunity is very important - it can be the difference between a good photo and an outstanding photo. If you're a photography professional or a hobby enthusiast - give this system a try, there is no better way to carry your camera always at the ready. And that's why I chose the Capture PRO Camera Clip from Peak Design to be my Gear of the Year 2015!
