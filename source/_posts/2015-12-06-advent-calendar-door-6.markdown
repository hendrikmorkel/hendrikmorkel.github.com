Dear Santa,

have you heard of the packrafter's nightmare? It's carrying a PFD on long trips. Because traditional foam PFDs are very bulky they're not nice to carry, and sitting in a packraft with them isn't the most comfortable thing either. Enter the [Anfibio Buoy Boy](http://www.packrafting-store.de/Safety/Anfibio-Buoy-Boy::499.html?language=en), an inflatable vest that gives you buoyancy when you're packrafting on lakes and rivers, and while you're backpacking it packs to the sizes of a 1 l bottle and weighs a mere 310 g! Developed by the passionate packrafters of the [Packrafting Store](http://www.packrafting-store.de/index.php?XTCsid=udhrlcr9ija6n1oj3jfmvplou2) and part of their [Anfibio line](http://www.packrafting-store.de/Extras:::19.html) of packrafting accessories, the Buoy Boy is a great way to add safety to your white water and lake adventures off the beaten track, with all the smart details a packrafter wants!
