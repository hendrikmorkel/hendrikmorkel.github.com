Dear Santa,

*What time is it? Where is North? How high am I? What's the weather going to be?*

That are questions whose answers matter when outdoors. Being aware of the time and when the sun will set, not being surprised by sudden storms in the mountains, having a compass and knowing the current height when checking a map - all things one needs to know when being on the go in the fells, mountains and forests. The [Suunto Vector](http://www.suunto.com/Products/sports-watches/Suunto-Vector/Suunto-Vector-Orange/) is the watch which tells all of the above, and it's track-record speaks for it. It's been on countless expeditions, trekking trips and overnighters, and with it's host of functions - besides the altimeter, barometer & compass it has an altitude log, a weather trend indicator and shows the vertical speed (that's why [Ueli Steck](http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/08/ueli-steck-interview.html) uses a [Suunto](http://www.suunto.com/) clock!) you got a lot of tech on your wrist, where you can easily see it. Oh, and it's light, too: Just 54 g. I'm sure you'd like it too, Santa - with it you always can find your way back home in a snow storm!

Sincerely yours,


An aspiring lightpacker
