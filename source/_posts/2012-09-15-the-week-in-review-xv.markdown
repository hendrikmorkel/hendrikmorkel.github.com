I realized I have done only six reviews in 2012 thus far, which equals 0,66666 Reviews per month. That's utterly terrible, given that this is supposed to be an outdoor blog. To right this wrong, I crowdsource the decision on what I should review in the near future; so leave a comment and let me know which one of the following items you'd like me to review next:

- Therm-A-Rest XTherm sleeping mattress
- enLIGHTened equipment Revelation quilt
- Hyperlite Mountain Gear Porter backpack
- Locus Gear Sil Khufu shelter

You got till Tuesday to vote, then I'll tally the scores and see which item comes out on top.
