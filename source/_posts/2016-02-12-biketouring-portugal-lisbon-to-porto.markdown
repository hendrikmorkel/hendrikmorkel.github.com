description: Escape November in Scandinavia and go biketouring along the coast of Portugal, where great roads, empty beaches and tasty food make every day a great adventure!
---

Last year I was fortunate to escape the dreaded month of November for a week and enjoy sunshine & cycling along the coast of Portugal, riding over 500 km from Lisbon to Porto.

After thru-hiking the [High Coast Trail](https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/01/hogakustenleden-the-high-coast-trail.html) in November of 2014 and experiencing all the weather you can expect in November in Scandinavia - snow, sleet, rain, grey clouds as far as you can see and a tiny bit of sun - my mind was set on the south for outdoor trips in November. Last year it was so far: I boarded a plane in Vaasa with my [Pelago Stavanger](https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/11/pelago-bicycles-stavanger.html) and flew to Lisbon, where +20°C temperatures and sunshine where waiting for me. During the following weeks I will share the adventure of riding in this beautiful country, but I already now want to get you in the mood for cycling in Portugal!

Riding from Lisbon to Porto made a lot of sense to me while planning this trip. And there were even other people who have done similar tours. But being on the road for a week and cycling North, I quickly decided that I makes more sense to do this trip the other way around. The reason is the North-Westerly wind which I had every day, and while Headwind is to be expected when cycling, some days I was swearing so much about the f#€k!n6 headwind that I made a mental note to recommend this tour the other way around. It's a lot nicer to cycle with tailwind than cycling against a headwind which slows you sometimes down so much that you're almost standing still.

I rode from Cascais, a suburb of Lisbon, to Sintra on Day 1, an easy 40 km which also took me to Cabo da Roca, the most westerly point of the European continent. On day 2 I managed to ride a 20 km Detour so that I arrived in Peniche at dusk with over 114 km cycled, while Day 3 where only 90 km to São Pedro de Moel where the fine Lighthouse above was warning the ships out in the ocean.

Day 4 I cycled to Coimbra which had me swearing the most about the headwind as I was cycling on a completely straight road to Pedrogão, though happily it got a bit less windy as I cycled inland. Cycling to Aveiro on Day 5 was more relaxed, though the cycling out of Coimbra in the fog with a visibility of less than 100 m had me scared about being crashed into a couple of times. On my last day to Porto I was cycling inland through tranquil little villages, up steep, steep cobblestone roads in the middle of the forest and then finally crossed the bridge into Porto, which put a big smile on my face.

If you want to escape November in Scandinavia & Central Europe go cycling or hiking in Portugal, where it is a beautiful sunny month with nice temperatures. I had help from [A2Z Adventures](http://a2z-adventures.com/en/) during the planning and execution of my trip, and if you don't want to go to Portugal on your own or fly with your bike join one of their [Biking Trips](http://a2z-adventures.com/en/find-trip/biking) - they have everything from self-guided trips to a guide cycling next to you and telling you all about the country. I cycled light and slept in B&Bs and Hotels along the way, and traded the stove and freezer bag meals to Lunches and Dinners in Cafés and Restaurants - Portugal is very affordable for Scandinavians. More coming soon, so *stay tuned for my Day-to-Day account coming to your favourite Scandinavian Outdoor Travel Blog!*
