If you just start out to lighten up it is easy to lose track of who offers what. Back as I started the journey to make my backpack and the gear carried lighter, I spent hours looking at gear lists of other people (still a great pastime) and watched closely on photos what people had with them (again, not a bad way to use your time - usually the setitngs were superb and the trips inspiring).
