<div style="text-align: left;"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;">The OutDoor trade fair in Friedrichshafen is over, and more and more news are popping up for those which weren't able to attend.</span></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;"><br /></span></div><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 198px; height: 151px;" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/Picture3.png" border="0" alt="" /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.outdoor-show.de/"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;">Source</span></a></div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;"><div><br /></div><br /></span><a href="http://www.odoo.tv/"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;">Odoo.tv</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;"> covers the Fair in videos which are very worth viewing, even if you don't speak German. Video is the medium of the internet, and it is great to see some of the tents, sleeping bags and other equipment in living pictures.<br /><br />Roman aka </span><a href="http://lighthiker.wordpress.com/"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;">Lighthiker</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;"> also presented already a few interesting posts about new goodies, his </span><a href="http://lighthiker.wordpress.com/2009/07/20/outdoor-2009-tents/"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;">Tent article</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;"> shouldn't be missed.<br /><br /></span><a href="http://hrxxl.wordpress.com/"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;">hrXXL</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;"> also was at the OutDoor, and is reporting about the new Inov-8 Roclite 288 GTX as well as tents and other goodies.

My thanks go out to these great folks for keeping us, who weren't able to make the trip to Friedrichshafen, up-to-date. Arigato.</span></div>
