What do you do on a rainy autumn weekday if you can't be outdoors yourself? You head to the [Banff Mountain Film Festival World Tour](http://www.banffcentre.ca/mountainfestival/worldtour/listings/regions.aspx?cat=I&location=eu) and meet like-minded folks and watch some inspiring outdoor movies!

Established in 1976, the Banff Mountain Film Festival is an international film competition and an annual presentation of short films and documentaries about mountain culture, sports and the environment. The original event is held in Banff, Canada, but thanks to [Pathfinder.eu](http://www.pathfindertravels.eu/) and their local partners we Northern Europeans can view the Festival also in [Copenhagen](http://www.pathfindertravels.eu/banff-danmark/), [Oslo](http://www.pathfindertravels.eu/banff-norge/), [Stockholm](http://www.pathfindertravels.se/banff-sverige/) (plus a few other Swedish cities, check the website!), and [Helsinki](http://www.pathfindertravels.eu/banff-finland/) - where you will be able to meet me on October 3rd!

There's a wide variety of movies at the Festival, from skiing & snow sports over climbing & mountaineering to adventure movies, so for each taste something. I'm especially looking forward to Tim Cope's *On the Trail of Genghis Khan* movie, as Tim also was a student at [IWG](http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/iwg/) like me. Even more, though, I'm looking forward to *Journey On The Wild Coast* which is by Erin and Hig from [Ground Truth Trekking](http://www.groundtruthtrekking.org/) - which should be a familiar name for ultralight backpackers (if not, [read their book](http://amzn.to/RMnD7l)!). Also Cold will be interesting to see, as it has gathered quite some prices and the Trailer is promising:

So, if the Banff Mountain Film Festival World Tour stops [in a town near you](http://www.banffcentre.ca/mountainfestival/worldtour/) - they come to many locations across the globe - I suggest you go and check it out, meet like-minded people, watch some good movies! And if you're coming to the Helsinki event, say Hi! if you see me or leave a comment to arrange a pre-coffee/ post-beer!
