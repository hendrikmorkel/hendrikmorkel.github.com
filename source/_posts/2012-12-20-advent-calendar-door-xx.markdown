Dear Santa,

Being an aspiring Ultralight backpacker means that I weigh EVERYTHING that I take on the trail. You would be surprised to see how quickly some of the small items add up, and it is there that one can save smartly. [LITEMOUNTAINGEAR](http://www.litemountaingear.com) helps with that, as they make a lot of small, light & smart accessoires which help me to lighten up. Their cuben stuff sacks hold a lot of tiny items - think Hygiene Kit and 1st Aid - while their UL tent pegs keep my shelter in place at a fraction of the weight of other pegs, and their Tarp Pole Extender helps me to pitch my shelter. As you see, small things, big weight savings. And as they're so light, I'm sure you wouldn't mind to bring me one of each, wouldn't you?

Un saludo, 
<br>
<br>
