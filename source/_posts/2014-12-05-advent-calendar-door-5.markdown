Dear Santa,

knowing things means you can improve of them. If I know my backpack weighs 3 kg empty, I can improve on it and get a lighter pack. Equally, if I know I only move 500 meters a day between Monday and Friday it's no wonder I feel unhealthy and can't go on longer weekend hikes. That's where the [vivofit](http://sites.garmin.com/fi-FI/vivo/vivofit/) from [Garmin](http://www.garmin.com/) comes in useful. The vivofit not just tracks my steps and distance each day, it also sets daily goals for me and nudges me on to reach them - a great way to improve my fitness and a sweet motivator to walk more often to work than take the car! It also displays calories and monitors my sleep, and that for a year without changing the battery - that's a lot of steps and hikes! This of course also helps me to get fit for my big backpacking trip next summer and feel more energized in daily life - thus a [vivofit](https://buy.garmin.com/fi-FI/FI/kellot-liikunta-ja-hyvinvointi/liikunta/vivofit-/prod143405.html) would be a great to find under the tree this year, ensuring I will be a fitter backpacker next year!

Sincerely yours,


The Ultralighter
