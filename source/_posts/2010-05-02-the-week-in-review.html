While you read what happened last week, I'll enjoy the Finnish spring with Phil and Steven who arrived last Thursday to go out for some tenkara fishing and backpacking in Pirkanmaa!<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/EHjJCscbpJ9AI4cvCjFbE_OMIrFnwhsBwaRfU1lT6O0?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S9gfp0LnkmI/AAAAAAAACUE/Qylfuj1XdTM/s800/P1040154.jpg" /></a><br /><br />The <a href="http://trekking-ultraleicht.de/news.php">trekking-ultraleicht.de</a> forum had this May weekend another Forum Meet-up in the workshop of LAUFBURSCHE in Cologne, and you can make sure that some of the German bloggers and on the forum itself there will soon be lots of accounts and photos of gear and stories!<br /><br />Geoff from v-g Backpacking in Britain went on a <a href="http://v-g.me.uk/Trips/G0063/G0063.htm">three day trip to Dartmoor</a>, and brought back beautiful photos and a great write up.<br /><br />Also Martin Rye set out to navigate the hills of Dartmoor, and his account you can read <a href="http://summitandvalley.blogspot.com/2010/04/slacking-in-dartmoor.html">here</a>.<br /><br />Michael is a German who is thru-hiking the PCT this year, and you can follow his pursuits here at "<a href="http://freiwildontour.blogspot.com/">Freiwild auf dem Pacific Crest Trail</a>" - he writes at the moment a couple of times a week, so we can nearly follow him "live"!<br /><br />And if you are curious what the ADZPCTKO '10 looked like, head over to <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/beemancron/2010PacificCrestTrailAnnualKickOff#">The Beeman's Picasa album</a> to take a look.<br /><br />Benjamin from hrxxlight went to France and <a href="http://hrxxlight.com/?p=142">walked the GR 53</a> and brought back some nice photos and story.<br /><br />Finally, Gustav from The Bearable Lightness made a <a href="http://thebearablelightness.blogspot.com/2010/04/lightweight-solo-trip-to-valadalen.html">solo trip to Vålådalen</a> to wet the appetite for a certain group of UL outdoor bloggers from the far north...<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/nVKAYknaIMipMYauf7nw_w?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S9hw-TZjEoI/AAAAAAAACV8/whQBt1Pal34/s800/IMG_6848.jpg" /></a><br /><br />In the Gear Review Department, Jason Klass takes a <a href="http://www.geartalkwithjasonklass.com/2010/04/mountain-laurel-designs-exodus-backpack.html">brief look at the MLD Exodus</a> and tells us what he likes about it.<br /><br />I did a small HD video of the world lightest gas stove, the <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/04/first-look-monatauk-gnat-video.html">Monatauk Gnat</a> and also will organize a passaround with it - go comment if you'd like to give it a try!<br /><br />PTC was at innov_ex 2010 and was <a href="http://www.petesy.co.uk/innov_ex-2010-live/">reporting live from the event</a>.<br /><br />Robin made an initial review of the <a href="http://blogpackinglight.wordpress.com/2010/04/25/scarp-1-review/">Tarptent Scarp 1 Mk II</a> and had much good to say about it, as well as suggestions for improvement.<br /><br />Q has a look at the 20l <a href="http://qbloggt.blogspot.com/2010/04/sea-to-summit-ultra-sil-daypack.html">Sea to Summit Ultra-Sil backpack</a>, and wonders if it is big enough for a weekend trip.<br /><br />And in other news, Fraser from McAlisterium tells us what <a href="http://mcalisterium.wordpress.com/2010/04/25/photography-what-ive-learned-so-far-pt1/">he has learned about photography so far</a>.<br /><br />Talking of photgraphy, if Northern Lights, aka aurora borealis, are fascinating to you, head over to this site to have a look at the <a href="http://www.leuku.fi/index.php?kansiohaku=1&mode=folder&ko=1&kid=3&rid=86&arid=&ro=1">photography of Jorma Luhta</a>.
