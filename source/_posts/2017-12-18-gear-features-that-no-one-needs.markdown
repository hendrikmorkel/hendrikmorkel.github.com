You come across them almost daily: New gear features which are praised as "*unique*", "*innovative*", and my favourite: "*revolutionary*". Usually they promise "*extreme breathability*", "*keeps you dry in a taifun*", "*super comfortable*", "*makes your outdoor life easy*" and similar phrases which surely must be from some top secret "*Handbook to write gear descriptions*". The truth is: 95% are useless and don't add anything to the piece of kit in question. Here's my top useless gear "Features" that no one needs.

## Pit zips

Pit zips are beyond me, as are people who think they're a must in a hardshell. Usally that's because people who think they need pit-zips in their jacket are of the *urban-outdoorer* kind, who wear their 500â‚¬ hardshell on the walk to the car. Pit zips are nowadays almost ubiquitos in high-end jackets, and what riddles me most is that 100% of these jackets claim to be *made from the most breathable material, EVER*. If it's so breathable, get rid of those massive holes under the arms of the garment and their heavy zippers. Also the activities these pit zips jackets are made for makes one ponder: Have the designers ever tried that activity? Pit zips in an ice climbing & mountaineering jacket, where you're going up, are close to the snow, ice and water, is just a sure way to get the underneath layers wet - and not from your sweat, that is. They're also designed ina way that to be functional (as in, aiding in ventilation) you should walk/ cycle/ climb like Jesus was nailed to the cross. 


## Sleeve pockets

Does one of your garments has a sleeve pocket? Have you ever used it? I thought so. I have tried a few garments with sleeve pockets, and always came to the same conclusion: Utterly useless. The size is usually the biggest joke - maybe the designers of them still use Siemens cellphones, because the claimed "fits a phone" certainly doesn't hold true for modern smartphone. Sure, you could insert a energy bar. Just what good a Snickers is on my upper arm is beyond my grasp - especially if you start to walk a bit faster or, god-forbid, go vertical. Because then whatever you have entered into your super-duper-useless sleeve pocket is bound to fall out of it. 


## Pockets, Pockets, Pockets

Many new jackets come with such an overdose of pockets on the market that you almost wouldn't need a backpack anymore. *Two Napoleon pockets, two hand pockets, three inside pockets and a sleeve pocket*. Sorry? Did zippers and fabrics come for free? Who the hell needs an overdose of pockets on his jackets? I find four pockets already too much, what the fuck do I need eight pockets for? This phenomen isn't exclusive to garments, either: Many backpacks come with a spawning amount of pockets. There's certainly a few pockets needed on a rucksack, but 



## It will charge your gadget

Apparently outdoor folks are just as addicted to their smartphones as their urban counterparts, otherwise we wouldn't be presented by an increasingly wide variety of so-called "chargers" which will keep your smartphone powered while on the trail. We've got stoves that work with fire or gas which will charge your gadget, 

Free Pro-Tip: Switch it off to save energy.

## 3-in-1 Garments

Again one from the "Urban Outdoorer" category, the 3-in-1 Jacket. Basically some figured out that outdoor folks usually wear a midlayer between their hardshell and baselayer, and smacked a 3-in-1 garment for the unsuspecting people (or those who don't want to faff around picking up two garments).
