Dear Santa,

now that you brought me a wonderfully warm down hat, my wife is loaning it all the time and I still get cold ears! I realized the only way to get my down hat back is to get her a own one. The [Aria Beanie](http://www.outdoorresearch.com/eua_en/or-gear/headwear/aria-beanie.html) from [Outdoor Research](http://www.outdoorresearch.com/) would be perfect for her needs, I think - light, warm, and stylish it is what a woman wants, if you ask me! It would be great if you could send me one for her!

Happy Fourth Advent, 
<br>
