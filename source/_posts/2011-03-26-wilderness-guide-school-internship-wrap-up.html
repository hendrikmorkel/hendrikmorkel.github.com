The internship is over, I got an excellent customer service evaluation, made great connections with people and got to see a new area. Time to wrap things up.<br /><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/e3fpiMQ683oVIfAjsSEcLCBBbHBQPEZAJ8vraTRirYA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TYSIfTjxr9I/AAAAAAAAEL0/2n9bvjpxVhg/s640/_DSC1277.jpg" height="347" width="640" /></a><br />Yours truly enjoying the show.<br /><br />Obviously these kind of trips are very different from what I normally do, and will when I will be guiding in the future. It was, however, a superb experience. Seeing that there are highly efficient companies like <a href="http://www.upitrek.com/"target="_blank">Upitrek</a>, where things work smoothly like a clock work, is rewarding and a great asset for tourists coming to Finland, because they can be sure to have a wonderful holiday.<br /><br />I always believe that the customer is King (a remnant of my bachelor degree studies!), and hence tried to be very customer oriented as a guide, paying attention to the different needs and ensuring everyone had a good experience. While the guide work itself was not especially difficult in my opinion, it are long days - on average from 8.00 in the morning till 21.00 at night - in which one needs to be available, and "me time" is very limited. This ain't of a problem if the group you are with and your fellow guides are as great as on the two trips I was on, but might be more of a challenge if you get difficult clients. Other than that the work is good fun and rewarding to see the clients enjoying themselves on their holidays!<br /><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/0xYUmielZyOJo96pyHivpjWiupv70N-RGKSfyQFBX78?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TY3AnkgKaKI/AAAAAAAAEP4/b50r1oTO5eI/s640/_DSC1322.JPG" height="426" width="640" /></a><br /><br />On the whole, the two weeks of internship were far more rewarding and enlightening than the time spent in class in Kuru. I will report on my growing frustration of the school separately in an update, but the internship really gave some joy and happiness, while I was able to learn a few things from my fellow guides along the way. <br /><br />Finally, in case you haven't guessed yet, the focus of <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/p/guiding.html"target="_blank">my guided trips</a> in the future will be on lightweight and ultralightweight backpacking and packrafting; being off-trail expeditions in which we sleep outside and enjoy the beautiful Arctic scenary during the different seasons. I am currently planning one such trip, so if you are possibly interested, then you should stay tuned or <a href="mailto:hendrik.morkel@gmail.com?subject=Guide me in the Arctic!">get in touch</a> =)</div>
