Events aligned in a fortunate way yesterday. I will be out guiding on my first paid gig as a wilderness guide starting on Sunday for a whole week, returning to the beautiful <a href="http://www.outdoors.fi/destinations/nationalhikingareas/hossa/Pages/Default.aspx"target="_blank">Hossa Hiking Area</a> where I spent two weeks earlier this year during the winter.<br /><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Hf8mUpR2b2fUL4xZvZwNPiBBbHBQPEZAJ8vraTRirYA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-GvT436oSNm8/TYSFPZcmGWI/AAAAAAAAEK8/HgkvjG8OHLI/s640/_DSC1195.jpg" height="271" width="640" /></a><br />The last time I was in Hossa, there was plenty of ice and snow around.<br /><br />It was on pretty short notice - a text message yesterday afternoon asking me if I could jump in and guide a tour, starting this coming Sunday, for a whole week. A call to my wife, a look at the programme, a call to Urpo at <a href="http://www.upitrek.com/"target="_blank">Upitrek</a>, another call to my wife, and it was settled - I will be going Sunday up north to guide for Upitrek for a whole week! I was a bit skeptical, as I have <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1277447934/ultralight-a-z-the-video-guide-to-lightweight-back"target="_blank">a bunch</a> of <a href="http://korpiconsulting.com/index_en.html"target="_blank">work</a> cut out for me at the moment, but after my wife encouraged me, I decided to go. A chance like this doesn't come along that often, so better take them when they appear! It is also a splendid opportunity to practice my guiding skills, and make these important connections in the very small guiding business circles in Finland.<br /><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/rBoSRh9HRiK8q76cKTDLszWiupv70N-RGKSfyQFBX78?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-q0hMBqBWJNg/TjqKViEGUcI/AAAAAAAAFD0/-fpltOoDVXA/s640/Screen%252520Shot%2525202011-08-04%252520at%2525203.01.58%252520PM.jpg" height="193" width="640" /></a><br />Weather-wise I hope it is a bit better than this longterm forecasts predicts.<br /><br />The tour I will be guiding will operate with a base camp, and small excursions in the surroundings of the Hossa Hiking Area will take place every day. Hiking, canoeing, a visit to a reindeer farm, bear watching and visiting 4000 year old rock paintings are on the itinerary, together with a warm Sauna (and swimming!) each evening. It will be quite the opposite to sitting in a office in downtown Helsinki, where I am this week.<br /><br />Best of all: I will be camping the whole week out under my new <a href="http://gossamergear.com/shelters/shelters/cubictwinn-tarp.html"target="_blank">Gossamer Gear CubicTwinn</a> and be sleeping in my new <a href="http://vimeo.com/26912303"target="_blank">BPL Vapr bivy</a>! As the weather will be wet but warm, I reckon the BPL Cocoon 240 quilt will be what I take, and I also will bring my <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/04/first-look-tenkara-fly-fishing-gear.html"target="_blank">tenkara fly fishing gear</a> along - Hossa is a popular fishing destination, and I wasn't able to go out fishing a lot yet this year. Maybe even try <a href="http://www.webtogs.co.uk/Jetboil/"target="_blank">a new stove</a>? Oh, and while I will be "roughing it" outside in bivy and tarp, the guests will sleep in a beautiful log cabin. Probably they more comfortable and smart way, looking at the weather forecast =)<br /><br />As you might guess, I am pretty excited about this! Being outdoors with guests, showing them the beauty of the Finnish forests and lakes which I love so much, is what I set out to do as I did the Wilderness Guide education. Most of all I am very proud and happy that my wife actually encouraged me to go - Kiitos rakkani!<br /><br />So, there will be some radio silence here while I am out, obviously. You always can browse past trip reports and articles, or take a peak at my <a href="http://youtube.com/user/Habichtshorst"target="_blank">Youtube</a> and <a href="http://vimeo.com/hendrikmorkel/videos"target="_blank">Vimeo videos</a>. Or, a really extreme proposition: You could go out hiking yourself ;) <br /><br />Happy trails!</div>
