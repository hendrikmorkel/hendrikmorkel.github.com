For years the [Joby GorillaPod](http://hikinginfinland.com/2011/04/joby-gorillapod-slr.html) has been my "tripod" of choice. And while I certainly still use it and often have it along on trips, in above tree line environments or when a real tripod would be more convienent than a GorillaPod, I needed something that's still light enough to carry but can get high enough for photos, timelapses and video. Enter the Velbon V-Pod, probably the Worlds Lightest Tripod.

I first read about the Velbon V-Pod a few year's ago on Dave's, the [Armchair Adventurer](http://www.armchair-adventurer.com/), blog. But it still has taken me an unreasonably long time to purchase a V-Pod, which I now, with hindsight, regret.

My Velbon V-Pod weighs 279 gram, has a transport length of 29 cm, is fully extended 100 cm tall and has a minimum height of 28 cm. It carries my [Sony NEX-5r](http://amzn.to/ZXzy8j) with a *heavy* Pentax Asahi 55mm lens (body + lens = 570 g) without problems, though if you go outdoors with a Canon 7D or similar you might want to use something more substantial as a tripod. But for the M43 crowd and Point-and-Shoot photographers, the Velbon V-Pod is a superb tool.

I used it since for shooting [timelapse movies](https://vimeo.com/60198868), [aurora borealis and stars](http://www.facebook.com/hikinginfinland), videos and stills. It is small enough to go inside the backpack or put it under a strap or a mesh pocket on the outside, and is ready to use in less than 30 seconds. It has a ball head which allows for great fluid movements and picking almost any position you'd like. If it is windy you can attach a weight (your backpack) to the centre strut of the V-Pod to pull it down and keep it in place.

It comes with a carrying pouch (12 g) and a holder for smartphones (25 g). Especially the latter is pretty neat (unless you have a [Glif](http://amzn.to/10cFigF)) as it allows you to use your smartphone for videos, stop-and-go animations and photos.

In short: I'm sorry that I waited so long to buy the Velbon V-Pod. It's a superb tool for photographers who use lightweight cameras, and nowadays the V-Pod finds its way into my pack on pretty much each trip, long or short. If you're searching for a lightweight tripod for your Micro Four Thirds or similar camera, look no further. The Velbon V-Pod is the answer for us lightweight backpackers & photographers.
