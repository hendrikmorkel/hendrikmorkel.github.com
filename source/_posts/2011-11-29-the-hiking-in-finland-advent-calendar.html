For kids the time before Christmas is exciting. You sent in your wish list of presents to <s>your parents</s> Santa, in the hope that he hasn't observed you those times when you were nasty to your siblings and/ or mom &amp; dad and only checked in on you when you were showing your best side. The waiting time till the 24th was made easier with advent calendars. As I was a kid, those contained small chocolates. Some things change (We got our son a fabulous LEGO Star Wars Advent calendar! It is for him, I promise =), and while I still have a calendar full of small chocolates today, I thought it would be fun to do something special for you - the amazing readers which make Hiking in Finland such an interesting place to be, which keep me motivated to write, film, and photograph and share my adventures. <br /><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/CBiBoJXd2bLrEb6xpfBoiDWiupv70N-RGKSfyQFBX78?feat=embedwebsite"><img height="426" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-IK7r1dW9TPs/TtTewLLEnGI/AAAAAAAAFlw/gEjZviZJO0k/s640/DSC01574.JPG" width="640" /></a><br /><br />As I have good connections to manufacturers, distributors and shops selling lightweight backpacking, climbing and biking gear, what better thing as using those connections to create the ultimate UL Backpackers/ Climbers/ Cyclists Advent Calendar? Exactly! So I set out, invested a bunch of my time to get companies and shops on board, and it is with much satisfaction that I present you <br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: orange; font-size: large;">The Hiking in Finland Advent Calendar</span></b></div><br />Over the next 24 days you will be able to win each day a piece of kit. From pullovers over backpacks to climbing gear, each day one post with a sweet piece of kit goes online, and will be raffled off to a lucky Hiking in Finland reader. There will be some rules and tasks, though:<br /><br />1. <b>You only can win once</b>. This adds a bit of a gamble to the whole calendar, and makes you take risks with when &amp; where you post your comment. Of course if you don't win one day, you still can try your luck the next day! <br />2. Generally <b>you only need to comment to participate</b>, but on some occasions there might be additional stuff you need to do to qualify.<br />3. <b>It is open to everyone</b>. As in from Afghanistan to Zambia, I send prices everywhere. And as I pay the postage out of my pocket, don't expect priority &amp; signed shipping for huge items. <br />4. If you win, and I don't hear from you by the next day via <b>Email</b>, you lose and it goes to the second in line. <br />5. Posts go online in the morning at six, and entering closes <strike>at noon</strike> 3 pm (or 15 o'clock for those who count the hours like me) - Finnish time. I then will annex the post with the winner (+ 2nd and 3rd places) to keep updates to a minimum.<br />6. You can't bribe me or anyone involved to win. You use the item(s) on your own responsibility. Use common sense.<br /><br />That's it, really. The Advent Calendar starts on Thursday, the 1st of December.
