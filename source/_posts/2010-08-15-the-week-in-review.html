After a very relaxing holiday in the Netherlands, there's a lot of catching up to do of what happened in the outdoor blogsphere during the week abroad. Lets start!<br /><br /><object width="853" height="505"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/FcfWsj9OnsI?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;color1=0xe1600f&amp;color2=0xfebd01"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/FcfWsj9OnsI?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;color1=0xe1600f&amp;color2=0xfebd01" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="853" height="505"></embed></object><br /><br />Lets start with the trips. Alberto De Giuli takes us on the <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&u=http://www.albertodegiuli.com/2010/08/via-ferrata-pertini-rifugio-stevia-vallunga-valgardena/"target="_blank">Via Ferrata Pertini Rifugio Stevia Vallunga Valgardena</a> and shows that one doesn't always needs to go to the super popular places in the Dolomites. <br /><br />James was <a href="http://backpackingbongos.wordpress.com/2010/08/07/backpacking-the-southern-arenigs-from-llanuwchllyn/"target="_blank">backpacking in the southern Arenigs from Llanuwchllyn</a> for a weekend, and had two nice wildcamps and brought home some fine photos.<br /><br />Dondo takes us on the <a href="http://dondo1.wordpress.com/2010/08/06/james-peak-wilderness-loop/"target="_blank">James Peak Wilderness Loop</a>, a beautiful trip report with beautiful photos. <br /><br />Comet now left California and is on the trail in <a href="http://www.iamthechan.com/2010/08/09/oregon/"target="_blank">Oregon</a>, getting closer and closer to the Canadian bother on his PCT hike. <br /><br />Some fine, fine photos is what Fraser lets us see from his holidays at <a href="http://mcalisterium.wordpress.com/2010/08/06/the-outer-hebrides-harris-and-lewis/"target="_blank">The Outer Hebrides: Harris and Lewis</a>. If you're as yet undecided where to go, this would be a tempting destination.<br /><br />I also liked Matthias' photos from his <a href="http://uloutdoors.wordpress.com/2010/08/06/gossamer-gear-murmur-probetragen-am-schneeberg/"target="_blank">walk on the Schneeberg, where he took his GG Murmur</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://thunderinthenight.blogspot.com/2010/08/under-weather-ultralight-adventure-in.html"target="_blank">Joe's Ultralight adventure in the Hardangervidda</a> also has stunning photos and shows that UL gear also is at home in the mountains. <br /><br />Paul from Sharkey's Dream went for a walk over the <a href="http://www.sharkeysdream.walkingplaces.co.uk/?p=3684"target="_blank">Clough Head & The Doddâ€™s</a> and I enjoyed this very scenic walk a lot. It is nice to see a walk documented from start to finish so well, so I recommend you stop by and give it a look!<br /><br />James from The Lighter Side was <a href="http://fynyddafr.wordpress.com/2010/08/06/playing-in-the-beacons/"target="_blank">playing in the Beacons</a>. <br /><br />Project Hyakumeizan from One Hundred Mountains reckoned that the best thing to do in the Japanese rainy season is to <a href="http://onehundredmountains.blogspot.com/2010/08/waders-of-lost-arc.html"target="_blank">climb through rivers</a> as you'll get wet either way. It is a great adventure which you should have read!<br /><br />The absolute highlight this week came from Roman Dial. A real gem, Roman shares with us <a href="http://packrafting.blogspot.com/2010/08/2006-arctic-1000-625-miles-in-24-days.html"target="_Blank">The Arctic 1000 adventure</a>, including the <a href="http://packrafting.blogspot.com/2010/08/2006-arctic-1000-lists.html"target="_blank">gear lists</a> and <a href="http://packrafting.blogspot.com/2010/08/arctic-1000-photos-by-request.html"target="_blank">photos</a>! It is an epic adventure, and I hope you take the time to read and see them!<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/sNFuDXfUKajVeFDUCG31SHuaAsOEDbUjS8lvO9CZbwA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TFZRnS5tZFI/AAAAAAAAC84/YQ0BqA1FKnQ/s800/P1020757.JPG" /></a><br /><br />I like my Ti-Tri/ Caldera Cone. How cool would it be to bake Pizza on it? That's what <a href="http://backpackingtechnology.com/backpacking-trips/pizza-on-a-caldera-stove-outback-oven/"target="_blank">Bob from Backpacking Technology</a> thought as well, and set out to try it on a recent trip - with much success! Go and check it out to add a new culinary experience to your trips!<br /><br />Benjamin looks at <a href="http://hrxxlight.com/?p=632"target="_blank">all the other stuff from the OutDoor 2010</a>, and in case you haven't seen it yet it is worth a look.<br /><br />Roman is back from his Via Alpina trip, and <a href="http://lighthiker.wordpress.com/2010/08/09/via-alpina-2010-gear-wrap-up/"target="_blank">reviews his gear</a> for said two week journey across the Alps.<br /><br />Adelaide from Dressed in Dirt ponders about the <a href="http://www.dressedindirt.com/2010/08/reconsidering-because-of-ray-jardine-sleeping-bags/"target="_blank">benefits of a quilt</a>, and if you're new to the idea or still need some more convincing, check her thoughts on the topic.<br /><br />Richard takes a second look at the <a href="http://maceachain.blogspot.com/2010/08/gosystem-flt-ti-take-2.html"target="_blank">GoSystem Fly (ti)</a> and made two videos to demonstrate them in action - go and watch them!<br /><br />Maz reviews the <a href="http://www.journeymantraveller.com/2010/08/montane-prism-20-jacket-review.html"target="_blank">Montane Prism 2.0 Jacket</a>, so before you pull the trigger on it give this article a go.<br /><br />Sam shows his <a href="http://ultralightbackpacking.blogspot.com/2010/08/alcohol-stoves.html"target="_blank">alcohol stove</a> collection and recommends to loan UL gear to friends in order to convert them - a statement which I second!<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/hRXLhC4CSTdIET6uCIuD43uaAsOEDbUjS8lvO9CZbwA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/TFhLRGU4KQI/AAAAAAAAC_U/f_dSITdLpJg/s800/P1020564.JPG" /></a><br /><br />What is a compass, and how do you use it? That is what <a href="http://www.briangreen.net/2010/08/using-compass-basics.html"target="_blank">this post from Brian</a> is about, and if you want to brush up your knowledge on compass and map skills, that is a good start.<br /><br />Another very good post comes from Norseman at Midwest Bushcraft and is on <a href="http://midwestbushcraft.blogspot.com/2010/08/weather-predictions-through-nature.html"target="_blank">Weather Predictions through Nature Observation</a>, for those days when there's no 3G reception to check the weather app.<br /><br />If you hike with your dog, you might want to tune in to the <a href="http://compasspointsmedia.com/backcountry-radio-august-12-2010/"target="_blank">Backcountry Radio</a> which talks about just that, as well as some other backpacking stuff.<br /><br />Hiking Trip Reports ponders about the <a href="http://www.hikingtripreports.com/2010/08/11/summer-hiking/"target="_blank">pros & cons of summer hiking</a>. I personally am not the biggest fan of it - it is too HOT! Happily autumn and winter are soon upon us!<br /><br />Torjus lives primitively in Norway, and I find it very inspiring. Saturday he went for a short walk in the mountains and did some <a href="http://livingprimitively.com/2010/08/chase-netting/"target="_blank">chase netting</a>, getting two fine trouts as well as cloudberries and chantarelles. Love it.<br /><br />Finally, I wrote an article about <a href="http://www.helsinkitimes.fi/htimes/lifestyle-and-entertainment/12015-i-caught-a-fish-this-big-.html"target="_blank">angling and fishing in Finland</a> for the Helsinki Times newspaper, and you can also read it online. <br /><br />Remember, you now can <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Nordic-Lightpacking/128701720487438">become a Fan of Hiking in Finland and Nordic Lightpacking on Facebook</a>!</div>
