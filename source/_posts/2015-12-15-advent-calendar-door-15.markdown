Dear Santa,

[As Tucas](http://astucas.com/) is making since a couple of years ultralight gear of the highest quality close to the beautiful Pyrenees in Spain. They're brand-new [Millaris Bivy Sack](http://astucas.com/millaris-bivy-sack) is the latest addition of their line-up, and this weather-resistant bivy is a great addition to their quilts. The waterproof bathtub bottom and windproof top will keep you dry and toasty, while the half-length zipper makes for easy and comfortable entry. Of course it is ultralight, too: Tipping the scales at 175 g in L size it's a serious contender for the lightest bivy bag award, which means it can always be along, for climbing trips in the Dolomites, packrafting trips in Lapland or backpacking adventures in Spain!
