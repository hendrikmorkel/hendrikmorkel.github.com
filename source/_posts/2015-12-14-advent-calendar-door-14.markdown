Dear Santa,

Winter is dark, and November and December are by far the darkest months. Light is essential for outdoor adventures in the winter, be it for trailrunning, cycling. climbing or backpacking. A good thing that [Suprabeam](http://www.suprabeam.com/uk/index.html) helps us see and bee seen in the darkness: The [V4pro rechargeable Headlamp](http://www.suprabeam.com/uk/products/v4pro-rechargeable) is a powerful headlamp which with its 800 Lumen lights up the trail ahead, and the Lithium-Polymer battery can easily be recharged. With a distance of up to 250 m you can see far ahead in the dark, and at just 195 g it is so light that you won't notice it when you wear it. The best of all is of course that it allows me to continue to be active in the dark - even if sitting in front of a log fire can be fun, too!
