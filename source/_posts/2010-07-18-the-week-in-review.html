Another scorching summer week has passed, another week in which I am looking forward to the cool and darker autumn nights, and sunny winter days. The most talked about topic this week certainly is the OutDoor fair in Friedrichshafen, which showcase a few interesting pieces for the UL & lightweight aficionado. Lets dive in.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.outdoor-show.com/od-en/supporting-programme/outdoor-industry-award.php"target="_blank">OutDoor Industry Award 2010</a> showcases a couple of interesting products for the UL backpacker, for example the Inov-8 bare-grip 200 trailrunners and the Terra Nova EquipmentLaser Ultra-1 tent. For more information on the news from Friedrichshafen, check <a href="http://www.fjaderlatt.se/2010/07/news-from-friedrichshafen-part-3.html#more/"target="_blank">Fjäderlätt</a> and <a href="http://hrxxlight.com/?p=510/"target="_blank">hrXXLight</a>.<br /><br />Hamilton from Traverse Japan gives us a run-down on how he made his <a href="http://traversejapan.wordpress.com/2010/07/14/whats-cheaper-lighter-and-more-breathable-than-an-e-bivy-my-myog-tyvek-bivy/"target="_blank">tyvek bivy</a> and if you're looking for an easy and cheap MYOG project, this might just be it.<br /><br />If a tyvek bivy is too simple for you as a MYOG project, check out <a href="http://sheddwellersmoments.blogspot.com/2010/07/new-tarp-catenary-cut-solo-tarp.html"target="_blank">Shed Dweller's Catenary Cut Solo Tarp</a>. You should also check his blog during the coming eek to see if this tarp can withstand a decent pounding!<br /><br />Robin from BackpackBaseCamp makes a comparison between the <a href="http://backpackbasecamp.blogspot.com/2010/07/evernew-dx-vs-trail-designs-caldera.html"target="_blank">Trail Designs Caldera Cone and the Evernew DX</a> and if you're in the market for a stove this little comparison is certainly worth a look.<br /><br />Adam from <a href="http://krudmeister.blogspot.com/2010/07/trttytict1250-miles-wmld.html"target="_blank">FSTPKR gives us a lo-down on the gear</a> he's going to be using on his trips this summer, and if you're in the market for MLD goodies make sure to give this article a good read!<br /><br />Mark gives us <a href="http://backpackingnorth.blogspot.com/2010/07/afton-shakedown-what-went-right-and.html"target="_blank">a shakedown on the gear</a> he used on his last hike, and illuminates why it is useful to test gear before you go on a longer trip.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/6vWdo5n57ChNSihux-JpIF4Au29CDYBoDzrGzVsKKHA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S8MPwyb8q0I/AAAAAAAACL8/4Pg5hwSYazA/s800/P1030952.jpg" /></a><br /><br />One of the best trip reports this week was for me certainly Matthias' <a href="http://uloutdoors.wordpress.com/2010/07/05/island-geduldigkeit-und-wie-alles-anders-kommt/"target="_blank">Iceland report</a>. Spectacular photos and a good story have put Iceland back on my radar, and should also put it on yours.<br /><br />If Iceland is too far away, then maybe a trip to the <a href="http://backpackingbongos.wordpress.com/2010/07/12/ben-more-scramble-via-achioch-isle-of-mull/"target="_blank">Isle of Mull and a scramble up Ben More</a> like James did it is more up your alley. Lush green hills, waterfalls and spectacular views are certainly to be had.<br /><br />Robin delivers <a href="http://blogpackinglight.wordpress.com/2010/07/17/lake-district-july-2010-part-1/"target="_blank">part one of his Lake District report</a>, showing that lush green hills and waterfalls also can be seen there - besides a bunch of rabbits!<br /><br />Dondo's <a href="http://dondo1.wordpress.com/2010/07/17/eaglesmere/"target="_blank">Eaglesmere</a> trip report is full of beautiful photos of wildflowers, lakes and some surprises.<br /><br />If you prefer lush green mountains in Japan, have a look at Hana's accent of <a href="http://hana2009.wordpress.com/2010/07/09/the-cocks-comb-鶏冠山-a-double-billing/"target="_blank">The Cock's Comb</a>.<br /><br />Cedar & Sand lets us take part on his trail run (!) along he <a href="http://cedarandsand.blogspot.com/2010/07/trans-zion.html"target="_blank">Trans-Zion</a>, that beautiful area in Utah. A very impressive achievement, and great photos!<br /><br />Trotten mit Hut takes us along on the <a href="http://trottenmithut.blogspot.com/2010/07/der-leo-jobst-wanderweg.html"target="_blank">Leo-Jobst trail</a> and shows that hiking in Germany is as beautiful as anywhere else. I love the sight of old ruins & "Fachwerkhäuser", and being able to pick cherries on the trail is splendid in this weather!<br /><br /><a href="http://ultralightbackpacking.blogspot.com/2010/07/splitboarding-and-backpacking-in-july.html"target="_blank">Sam combined backpacking and snowboarding (in July!)</a> on his last trip, and it certainly makes me want to take my board up some proper mountains and draw some lines into the snow.<br /><br />That UL backpacking is not only useful if you want to go snowboarding shows Yeti, who takes his Mountain bike on a <a href="http://yetirides.blogspot.com/2010/07/hot-riding-pt-1.html"target="_blank">trip in southern Finland on a hot weekend</a>  - some very beautiful scenery to be seen, so check it out!<br /><br />And the final trip report is part two of <a href="http://www.nielsenbrownoutdoors.com/2010/07/along-nordkalottleden-part-2.html"target="_blank">Roger's epic Nordkalottleden Saga: Gaskashytta to Jerta</a>, taking us further along this great route in the magic north!<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/c1Tky60UVxtwLQtdJAuM9OvluymBbGzMyVISrmnPGN4?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/SvCF-swS0aI/AAAAAAAAAyA/EWEMXDyVnAE/s800/IMG_3123.JPG" /></a><br /><br />If you'd like to improve your navigation skills or learn the basics, give the <a href="http://www.cardinalpoints.co.uk/"target="_blank">Cardinal Points</a> website a visit, it is a a map and compass simulation to teach navigation skills. <br /><br />A very special article to close this week is <a href="http://www.stevenhorner.com/?p=899"target="_blank">Steven's piece on how the outdoors made him who he is today</a>. A very great aricle, which I urge you to go and read!<br /><br /><a href="http://flattr.com/thing/985/Hiking-in-Finland-Ultralight-Backpacking-Blog" target="_blank"><img src="http://api.flattr.com/button/button-compact-static-100x17.png" title="Flattr this" border="0" /></a></div>
