A busy week. A week, in which I passed my Professional Examination, which means I took the practical hurdle on the road to becoming a Wilderness Guide. It feels great to have passed it, and having done so very well. Now three theoretical exams about birds, plants and general nature knowledge remain until I will graduate =) <br /><br /><iframe width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/hMf7TypZwtc?hd=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br /><b>News & Various</b>:<br /><br />Check out the David Attenborough narrated <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/video/2011/jun/03/united-nations-forests-david-attenborough?CMP=twt_fd"target="_blank">UN International Year of Forests - video</a> - it is the appropriate thing to do on World Environmental Day!<br /><br />Looking for some lighter gear to make your summer trips more enjoyable?
