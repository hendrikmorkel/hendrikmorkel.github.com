<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">Tomorrow at 08.50 o'clock the girlfriend and me will take the bus to Kuru to walk part of the Pirkan-Taival Trail. Its gonna be an easy, relaxed walk, where she will be the boss if it comes to speed and breaks. I will carry the food, sleeping bags and mattresses, kitchen and so on, while she can take it easy and carry the snacks and her own water. While I was considering going with the Real Turmat food, we decided to go with my own cooking for this trip. We also just got her a Haglöfs Hail Q Jacket this morning, for rain and wind protection. Together with her Haglöfs pants she's now set and should be save if there's some rain.<br /><br />Our Dinner will be curry rice with tuna and pineapple. Its quick and tasty, and costs significantly less than the 8€ one of the Real Turmat bags would have cost me. As a nightcap we take a hot Minttu cacao - Minttu is a delicious Finnish peppermint liqueur, and I saw in Alko that they had it in a small bottle so it is perfect for this trip.    <br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&current=IMG_0505.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_0505.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a><br />Dinner + Nightcap.<br /><br />As snacks I bought us a variety of organic fruit bars, at 1€ a piece they're affordable and tasty. Two organic chocolate bars for some quick energy, as well as a bag of assorted nuts should keep us going. If we feel like something warm to drink, the good cappucino cacao will be the go to.<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&current=IMG_0506.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_0506.jpg" border="0" alt="Food - snacks"></a><br />Snacks for the day.<br /><br />Breakfast will be organic müsli with milk powder, an apple - I can't continue to say how good apples are as trail food! - and another cup of cappucino cacao. I'll pre-mix the müsli and milk powder in zip-lock bags this evening, so I don't need to carry the cardboard boxes. <br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/?action=view&current=IMG_0507.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/IMG_0507.jpg" border="0" alt="Food - breakfast"></a><br />Breakfast.<br /><br />We'll be back Wednesday evening, so you can expect a trip report one Thursday or Friday. </span></div>
