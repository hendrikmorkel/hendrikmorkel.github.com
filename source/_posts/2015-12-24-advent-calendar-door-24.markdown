Dear Santa,

You know what winter is for? Ski-touring. Backcountry Ski-touring, Hut-to-Hut Ski-touring and early morning laps before work. [Mammut](http://www.mammut.ch) makes since many years many essential pieces of kit for ski-touring enthusiasts, and the [Ride Removable Airbag Backpack](http://www.mammut.ch/INT/en/B2C-Category/Equipment/Avalanche-Safety/Avalanche-Airbags/Ride-Removable-Airbag/p/2610-01100-0055-130) is a complete all-mountain and freeride backpack with the Removable Airbag System R.A.S. included. The 30l backpack weighs just 2.560 g and fits enough gear for a long day in the mountains, while the Removable Airbag System can be used also with other compatible backpacks or removed when not needed. There's a front pocket for avalanche safety equipment, an anatomically padded back and removable hipbelt, and skis or a snowboard can be carried in the front. It's a might fine pack and Airbag System that helps to keep one safe during those crazy El Ni√±o winters where it dumps a meter of snow a night and you can't wait to earn your turns the next morning. With this pack and my avalanche awareness knowledge I will be safer from a possible avalanche - now how about that snow for the holidays?
