## News

The reasons for the long absence of [TWIR](http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/the-week-in-review/)? I ran a [trail marathon](http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/09/run-or-die-nuuksio-classic-trail-marathon.html) and was [hiking in Lapland](http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/09/urho-kekkonen-national-park.html) for a week. Good excuses, me thinks.

I welcome [Scarpa](http://en.scarpa.net/?refID=hif) to HiF! Besides making the [best climbing shoes](http://en.scarpa.net/products/climbing/?refID=hif) they also make superb [mountaineering boots](http://en.scarpa.net/products/tech-mountain/?refID=hif) and [trailrunning shoes](http://en.scarpa.net/products/Trail-Running/?refID=hif). Check them out!

[GoLite](http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=ml&ti=122377&pw=73183) returns to Europe. Soon, at least. They'll be based in Switzerland, have a full webshop and supply other ultralight webshops, too. I'm curious to see how things will develop.

[TrailPix](http://kck.st/19dnynS) launched their Kickstarter campaign last week. I've been using one of the prototypes and the TrailPix is even better. If you hike with your camera and trekking poles, TrailPix allows you to use the poles as a very stable tripod which will even carry a DSLR!

The [Klymit LiteWater Dinghy](http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=ml&ti=228219&pw=73183) is here! A packraft that packs down to 4x9 inches, weighs less than 1 kg and has the superb price of just $225. Trying packrafting has never been cheaper!

[Angst & Mut im Gleichgewicht](http://www.dctp.tv/filme/angst-und-mut-im-gleichgewicht/) - an interview with Reinhold Messner.
