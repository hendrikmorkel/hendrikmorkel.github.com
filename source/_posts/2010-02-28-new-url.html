I feel it is about time that I change the URL of my blog to something easier, and with Google's great offer of less than 10â‚¬ for a custom domain I decided to switch to a dot com domain. So, I'd like to suggest that you update your bookmark to <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/">http://www.hikinginfinland.com/</a> instead of the old http://www.hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/ - although the old URL will forward you to the new one, so you're not missing out on anything if you read the blog from a browser, but some functions (like the Followers box on the right) might not work properly. It seems the RSS reader works just fine, but if you don't get updates there, you might want to update it to the new domain as well. <br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/yIz-vr_paYiAV4n6J_A7Sg?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S4qis0Qj0hI/AAAAAAAABuw/85cfH0zu9UE/s800/IMG_5145.JPG" /></a><br />From the <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2010/02/tufwt-10-trip-report.html">last trip</a>, a VauDe Scutum aka Power Lizard UL in the background, and a LAUFBURSCHE Cuben Tanzpalast in the foreground.</div>
