Dear Santa,

sometimes it feels I'm repeating myself. For example when I'm talking about the benefits of vests for backpacking, skiing and other outdoor pursuits. Take the [Sulit Vest](http://www.vaude.com/en-FI/Products/Clothing/Men-s-Sulit-Insulation-Vest-black.html) from [Vaude](http://www.vaude.com/) for example: The PrimaLoft® Silver Eco Insulation keeps you toasty warm in any weather and moisture isn't a big problem for it either. It's ideal when hiking in cold autumn rain for extra warmth or when skinning up the mountain during the early hours of the day. When it's not needed it packs away small in your pack. And to top things off, the garment is bluesign® certified and carries Vaude's Green Shape label, both a guarantee that this is a truly environmentally friendly garment. So all in all a truly useful piece of clothing that accompanies one from spring to winter on all outdoor trips.
