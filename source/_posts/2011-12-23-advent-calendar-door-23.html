However, looking over my wishlist, I found that it was lacking in form of an aesthetic cup to drink from when outdoors (or re-enacting this outdoor drinking feeling when indoors at the office). Then my attention was brought to <a href="http://www.kupilka.fi/en/home/"target="_blank">Kupilka</a> who make the wonderful <a href="http://www.kupilka.fi/en/products/kupilka+21/"target="_blank">Kupilka 21 kuksa</a>. Being part wood, part plastic they are easy to clean, light, and just what I was looking for design-wise in an aesthetic cup! If you still have place in that big sack of yours (I hope it has an extension collar!) then I would love to find one under tree this year.<br /><br />Best,<br /><br /><br /><i>- An aspiring UL-Backpacker</i><br /><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/YYScY4W1J4lmgTRji4YK5WiBcik-iSu3FtqWq-IAnas?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-tzG9Tg2AWOE/TvHOGhOemDI/AAAAAAAAFvs/wL3pxvwMOBQ/s640/DSC01713.JPG" height="426" width="640" /></a><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/H7NZ0GZ0RZMAtvcHL6svFmiBcik-iSu3FtqWq-IAnas?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ai_dz37L1M8/TvHOHv5tuiI/AAAAAAAAFvw/oWZT8ykLL6k/s640/DSC01716.JPG" height="426" width="640" /></a><br /><br />Leave a comment with a link to your favourite Hiking in Finland article.<br /><br /><b>UPDATE I</b><br /><br />I'm amazed amigos y amigas!
