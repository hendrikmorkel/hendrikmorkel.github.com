<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">Time's up and the moment of announcing the three lucky winners of the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/2009/10/msr-packsoap-raffle.html">MSR Packsoap Raffle</a> is here. I used a D30 (that's thirty sided die for those not versed in the language of nerd games =) to determine the winners.<br /><br /><a href="http://perkelesblog.blogspot.com/">Perkunas</a> from Finland<br /><a href="http://backpackingbongos.wordpress.com/">James</a> from the UK<br /><a href="http://i-cjw.com/">Chris</a> from Japan<br />are the lucky ones!<br /><br />Congratulations to the three of you, and a big thank you to all the other ones who tried their luck! I'll contact the winners via email in the next few days to ask for your address and get them into the post asap, so that you can get clean on the trail!<br /><br /><a href="http://technorati.com/faves?sub=addfavbtn&amp;add=http://www.hikinginfinland.blogspot.com"><img src="http://static.technorati.com/pix/fave/tech-fav-1.png" alt="Add to Technorati Favorites" /></a></span></div>
