Dear Santa,

Winter means most backpackers head indoors, grab a hot chocolate and relax with a good book by the fire. Not me. Sure, I will relax by the fire with a cup of hot chocolate, but the whole thing is outdoors, in the snow and cold. Winter is a great time to head to the fjells and forests, the silence is disturb just by the crushing of the snow underfoot. To have a good night's sleep, a warm sleeping bag is indispensable, and it's smart to protect it with a [Tyvek Bivy](http://www.trekking-lite-store.com/trekkingshop/Zelte/TLD-Tyvek-Bivi::681.html?refID=hif) from [Trekking-Lite-Store.com](http://www.trekking-lite-store.com/trekkingshop/?refID=hif). This 160 g tyvek cover packs small in the pack and at camp protects down and synthetic sleeping bags from snow and spindrift. Its open design makes it ideal for quilts, and lounging in your sleeping bag next to the fire becomes safe, too - no more need to worry about sparks burning through the shell material of the quilt as the tyvek cover will protect it.

Sincerely yours,


An aspiring lightpacker
