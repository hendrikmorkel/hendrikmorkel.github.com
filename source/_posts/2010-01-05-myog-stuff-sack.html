<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">A new year, and new goals. Long have I been reading about people who "Make Your Own Gear" or "MYOG" for short, and have thought that it must be expensive, complicated, time consuming, and not for me. Well, I was wrong. Buying the material and other accessories wasn't expensive at all. Sewing is so easy, I actually was surprised. Its not really time consuming once you have the routine down. Finally, I found I really enjoy it - its very rewarding to see the results of your own labour, especially if you usually work in front of the computer, like me.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/2DoSeelSS5AUPFeLcBS_4g?authkey=Gv1sRgCIuU7JCinc60kwE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S0MgpAKHcMI/AAAAAAAABSA/--L9I7a2kBw/s800/IMG_4688.JPG" /></a><br />The finished stuff sacks.<br /><br />In order to sew myself a VBL (Vapour Barrier Liner) suit for winter tours I ordered a few meters of cheap silnylon from </span><a href="http://www.extremtextil.de/"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">Extremtextil</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">. Delivery was quick, and for a meter price of 3,40 € for the silnylon it didn't rip any huge holes into my budget. I got a few cordlocks from the local </span><a href="http://www.partioaitta.fi/"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">Partioaitta</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"> store at 0,70 € a pop and a meter of cord was 0,24 €. So all in all the cost of one of the stuff sacks I made is maybe around 1,20 €.<br /><br />Anyhow, you'll have to wait for the VBL project, as for my first time in front of the sewing machine I decided to make some stuff sacks (If you follow me on </span><a href="http://twitter.com/hendrikmorkel"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">Twitter</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">, you'll have seen them already). You never can have enough stuff sacks, and it is a fairly easy project as well, taking less than an hour time. I didn't need to reinvent the wheel, as on </span><a href="http://www.backpackinglight.com/"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">Backpackinglight.com</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">  there was the excellent </span><a href="http://www.backpackinglight.com/cgi-bin/backpackinglight/make_your_own_gear_5_yards_to_sul_part_1.html"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">Make Your Own Gear: Five Yards to SuperUltraLight</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"> article series, and I decided this would be a good primer to get me ready. In </span><a href="http://www.backpackinglight.com/cgi-bin/backpackinglight/make_your_own_gear_5_yards_to_sul_part_2.html"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">Article number 2</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"> the author goes through a step by step guide on how to sew a stuff sack, which I followed quite closely. The end result you can see above, but lets go step by step.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/6MxGktYfcPp8cD9HSEaAGw?authkey=Gv1sRgCIuU7JCinc60kwE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S0Mf9AT1W_I/AAAAAAAABRw/gRq8y3tCtS8/s800/IMG_4628.JPG" /></a><br />Silnylon, supplies, instructions and we're ready.<br /><br />Making a plan of what you want to make is very helpful, before you start to cut your material wildly. <a href="http://phil-turner.net/">Phil</a> recommended me <a href="http://sketchup.google.com/">SketchUp</a> as a CAD programme for Mac, its free and easy to use, so what else do I need? After I put down my pattern for the stuff sacks and the other projects in the programme, I drew it on the material, and then the sharp scissors got out.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/hUc2M3oN9PE_KKAZamoGLg?authkey=Gv1sRgCIuU7JCinc60kwE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S0MgE7Yr75I/AAAAAAAABR0/iN3IgqnKJr0/s800/IMG_4635.JPG" /></a><br />Concentrated cutting.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/V9jLfaJpnVXm5xd04VxzpA?authkey=Gv1sRgCIuU7JCinc60kwE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S0MgNpt99vI/AAAAAAAABR4/9YXQoRfkxmM/s800/IMG_4666.JPG" /></a><br />Concentrated sewing.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/rdQNamNQc2RWk70q0-JrlA?authkey=Gv1sRgCIuU7JCinc60kwE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S0MgjIB0FuI/AAAAAAAABR8/Rxn5a9OBZBc/s800/IMG_4677.JPG" /></a><br />Concentrated folding.<br /><br />Sewing the first stuff sack took me around 45 minutes, while the second one was already done after about 20 minutes. Its a really easy thing, and can be done by the novice as I just illustrated - it was the first time I sat in front of the sewing machine! Here some more close-up shots of the finished results:<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Sb-8pBurWw8FmOrr0RqIbQ?authkey=Gv1sRgCIuU7JCinc60kwE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S0MgpkEuu0I/AAAAAAAABSE/RCmLD1Kx-d0/s800/IMG_4689.JPG" /></a><br />Square bottom.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/W-qIzUoAyNzz6jb62rx-1Q?authkey=Gv1sRgCIuU7JCinc60kwE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S0MgqJOw7vI/AAAAAAAABSI/vjwaRGXqWdY/s800/IMG_4690.JPG" /></a><br />Inside seams.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/U36UEWMgLIBcsm85CtNjAA?authkey=Gv1sRgCIuU7JCinc60kwE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S0MgqiTSq4I/AAAAAAAABSM/iQnnC09zjMg/s800/IMG_4692.JPG" /></a><br />Cordlock closure & reinforcement on the front.<br /><br />The stuff sacks check in at 9 g a piece, which is much lighter than any other stuff sacks I own. I reckon if I would use Spinnaker or Cuben I can go bigger and stay in the low double digits, but that will have to wait. So what's next? Well, the second item in the BPL article is a <a href="http://www.backpackinglight.com/cgi-bin/backpackinglight/make_your_own_gear_5_yards_to_sul_part_3.html">Tarp</a>....</span></div>
