<div class='post'>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">On Monday my <a href="http://www.bushbuddy.ca/">BushBuddy</a> Ultra arrived, after only 9 working days in the mail. I drove by bike to the customs to pick it up, and after I paid a <br />16,50€ customs-fee I was back on my bike. However, I was already a happy backpacker as I couldn't wait to weight it, so I borrowed the scale at the customs office, and my BushBuddy Ultra is 134 gr!<br /><br />The box it comes in:<br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/Gear/?action=view&current=IMG_2949.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/Gear/IMG_2949.jpg" border="0" alt="BushBuddy Ultra"></a><br /><br />Unpacked in front of the lovely wooden box and the instructions leaflet:<br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/Gear/?action=view&current=IMG_2953.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/Gear/IMG_2953.jpg" border="0" alt="BushBuddy Ultra"></a><br /><br />I ordered a Tibetian Titanium 1100 Pot from <a href="http://www.ultralightoutdoorgear.co.uk/">Ultralight Outdoor Gear</a> on the same day I ordered the BB Ultra, and it was within five working days delivered to my door. Its beautiful, but I won't feel bad about the soot it will collect - its an item I will use, and not an item I put on the shelve to look at. But here it is in its pristine glory:<br /><br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/Gear/?action=view&current=IMG_2932.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/Gear/IMG_2932.jpg" border="0" alt="Tibetian Titanium 1100 Pot"></a><br /><br />The BB fits perfectly in there, and together the two are a beautiful couple:<br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/Gear/?action=view&current=IMG_2933.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/Gear/IMG_2933.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a><br /><br />And here in "cooking simulation":<br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/Gear/?action=view&current=IMG_2939.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/Gear/IMG_2939.jpg" border="0" alt="BushBuddy + 1100 Titanium Pot"></a><br /><br />Both go in the packsack the TT 1100 Pot came in:<br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/Gear/?action=view&current=IMG_2947.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/Gear/IMG_2947.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a><br /><br />Finally, a comparison photo of my old system versus the new system. Trangia 25-3 UL + the Alcohol bottle on the left, BushBuddy Ultra + Tibetian Titanium 1100 Pot in packsack on the right.<br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/Gear/?action=view&current=IMG_2930.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v645/Habichtshorst/Hiking/Gear/IMG_2930.jpg" border="0" alt="Old vs. New"></a><br /><br />The cold hard facts for the number guys out there:<br /><br />BB Ultra: 134 grams<br />TT Pot + Lid: 141 grams<br />TT packsack: 18 grams<br /><br />Makes for a total of 293 grams. I will be adding a LMF Swedish FireSteel Mini and some tinder in there, as well as my Spork for cooking. Also a Pot cozy and a wind screen are in the making, so I guess it will increase a bit. But in comparisons to the old system I shaved off around 1700 grams (that includes 1l of Alcohol), so its a lot and a good first step towards a lighter load. <br /><br />On the price side, I paid 75€ incl. shipping for the BB Ultra + 16,50€ for customs, that's 91,50€, or about the same as the Trangia 25-3 UL set costs. For the TT 1100 Pot I paid about 43€ incl. shipping. <br /><br />Pictures of the system in action including boiling times will follow during the weekend.</span></div>
