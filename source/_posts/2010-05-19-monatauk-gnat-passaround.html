Life sometimes is like that, though as you surely know, good things come to those that wait.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/1M3SZxoGWoj-_hgc8VBfIQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S_OA8R210ZI/AAAAAAAAClE/swqNXfXINnA/s800/IMG_6835.jpg" /></a><br /><br />The five testers will be:<br /><br />- Tobias Nurmiranta<br />- Len the Harmonicaman<br />- <a href="http://packrafting.blogspot.com/">Roman Dial</a><br />- <a href="http://hrxxlight.com/">hrXXL</a><br />- GForce<br /><br />Please contact me via Email (on the right under the creative commons note) and give me your complete address, then I will pack the Gnat and make it ready for its trip around the world =) Thanks to all other participants, the next Passaround should come along during next week.</div>
