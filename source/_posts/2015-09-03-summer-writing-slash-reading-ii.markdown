## Climb

For Britain's biggest climbing magazine [Climb](http://www.climbmagazine.com) I have written about the 2015 Arc'teryx Alpine Academy and being in a magazine that has Tommy Caldwell of Dawn Wall fame on the cover is a pretty sweet treat, too. You can [check out a preview](http://greenshires-design.com/Climb/SEPTEMBER%202015/CLIMB-SEP15_TEASER.html) online, pick the magazine up at your local news paper agent in the UK or get a digital version from the App Store.

## Bike & Travel

For the [Bike & Travel](http://www.biketravel-magazin.com/) I wrote about the right stove choice for your next cycle-touring and bikepacking adventure. I also reviewed my Pelago Bicycles Stavanger, a bike I have used a lot during the last year. You can grab a copy at the news agent or [order it online](http://shop.trekkingmagazin.com/de/biketravel/einzelhefte/biketravel-magazin-3-2015).

## trekking Magazin

And for the trekking Magazine I have penned a lengthy article about the 3-for-3 Approach to [lightening up your load](http://bit.ly/1UP0piq) and shed light on the usefulness of vests for the coming autumn, with a review of three vests which I have used since many years. If you're a backpacker who wants to lighten her load pick up the current issue tomorrow at your local news agent or [order it here](http://shop.trekkingmagazin.com/de/trekking-magazin/einzelhefte).
