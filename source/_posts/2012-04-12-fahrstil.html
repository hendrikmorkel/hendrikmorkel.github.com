It is not often that you find a magazine that is good. And with good, I mean, like, really fricking awesome. <a href="http://www.fahrstil-magazin.de/"target="_blank">fahrstil</a> is such a magazine.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/7071387683/" title="fahrstil by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7226/7071387683_d638787288_c.jpg" width="800" height="531" alt="fahrstil"></a><br /><br />I found out about fahrstil because <a href="http://whileoutriding.com/"target="_blank">Cass</a> has <a href="http://whileoutriding.com/2012/03/25/fahrstil-magazine-deutsch-framebag-feature/"target="_blank">a feature in this issue</a>, and posted on his blog about it. As I put in an order for a set of Porcelain Rocket frame bags, I was curious to read it, and was utterly surprised by the high quality of the whole magazine.<br /><br />160 pages thick, of which an estimated five were ads, it is full of epic content. Content which is interesting, well-researched, thought-provoking, humours. In short: Epic. Each issue is dedicated to one theme - issue seven here in front of me is dedicated to <i>mode</i>, or fashion in English. Erik Spiekermann talks about bicycle logos of the past & present, there's an article on the trend of Fatbikes (and it seems the fahrstil staff read <a href="http://tonilund.blogspot.com/"target="_blank">Toni's</a> & <a href="http://yetirides.blogspot.com/"target="_blank">Peter's</a> blogs, as they're mentioned in that article!), the end of Fixie Inc. and much, much more. And if you follow <a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/search/label/The%20Week%20In%20Review"target="_blank">The Week in Review</a> and take a look at the contributors of the issue, you will find a few <a href="http://lacemine29.blogspot.com/"target="_blank">familiar names</a>.<br /><br />You pay 15â‚¬ for epic content with little ads, printed on high-quality paper. I liked issue seven so much that I back-ordered the previous six issues, and will take out a subscription. <a href="http://www.fahrstil-magazin.de/Shop/Magazin/"target="_blank">Buy your copy online</a>, or check out the <a href="http://www.fahrstil-magazin.de/fahrstil-haendler/"target="_blank">brick & mortar shops which have it on the shelf</a>. You won't be disappointed - except if you are not able to read German.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/6925313254/" title="fahrstil - inhalt by HendrikMorkel, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5156/6925313254_42bd0b2864_c.jpg" width="800" height="531" alt="fahrstil - inhalt"></a></div>
