<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">Ah, refreshments are so important, be it hot or cold outside. Useful if you don't want to carry a heavy bottle are collapsible bottles like the <a href="http://cascadedesigns.com/platypus/handheld-hydration/softbottle/product">Platypus Softbottle</a>. The new version comes in different colours and promises to spice up your life, while the markings on the back inform you how much liquid you still have - very useful if you cook food and need to measure exact amounts of water but don't have any other means.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/cQYx1Mr0floST57J-9ioEQ?authkey=Gv1sRgCIj_x5-otubi3QE&feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TyRaf0hBoEE/S0yHuEMMBSI/AAAAAAAABWE/GumCgl81ca4/s800/20100112_platypus_0002.jpg" /></a><br /><br />Obviously the bottles are BPA free and of the same great quality you know from Platypus. And for the wine lovers, who like to take a good drop on the trail to enjoy by the fire (like Xavier and me <a href="http://hikinginfinland.blogspot.com/2009/12/trip-report-winter-fun-on-pirkan-ura.html">on our last trip</a>) Platypus now offers the <a href="http://cascadedesigns.com/Platypus/Wine-Preservation/PlatyPreserve/product">PlatyPreserve</a>, which will protect your fine drop on the trail till you want to enjoy it. <br /><br /><a href="http://cascadedesigns.com/Platypus">Platypus</a> gave me a PlatyPreserve and a 1l Platypus Softbottle for a raffle, and anyone can try his luck to win it. What you need to do? Leave a comment and tell me<br /><br />a) Your favourite backpacking book and what you like about it<br />b) Your favourite red- or white wine and with which trail food you'd like to enjoy it<br /><br />On Friday the 22nd of January 2010 at 12.00 o'clock Finnish time the raffle closes and I will pick the winner with the help of <a href="http://www.random.org/">Random.org</a> and will send the two Platys the following Monday. I send worldwide, from Fiji (where <a href="http://packrafting.blogspot.com/">Roman</a> currently tries to packraft) to Russia, so try your luck and get yourself a Platypus and a PlatyPreserve for 2010! If you belong to the fraction who can't wait or doesn't try its luck, check out <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/">Bergzeit</a> for one.</span></div>
