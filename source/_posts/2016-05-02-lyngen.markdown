Ski-touring in late April: Daylight from 4 am till 10 pm, great powder or spring crust, wall-to-wall sunshine & all topped off with that breath-taking fjord & mountain view of the Lyngen Alps.

Together with Henryk from [Out of Office](http://www.oooyeah.de) I spent a fantastic week in the Lyngen Alps. Here's a wee teaser so you can book your flight tickets and accommodation there for next spring, because it most certainly is a place you want to be. It all starts in Tromsø, where already the approach by plane is breath-taking. Then you go for a walk in the old town and pick up your Van from [Take me Away Camping](http://www.takemeaway.no) to head north-west to the Lyngen Alps and their surroundings.

You probably want to stop to take in the view once in a while.

When your bindings decides to break you go for a walk along the coast of Arnøya and make a stop in a lovely little cabin.

You take the ferry and enjoy the smell of the sea on deck.

And what's wrong with sitting down in the sun and have a beer (after a day of skiing, obviously!)?

On the summit you snap a selfie with that big grin because the view is so amazing.

And while the tide is low you go for a walk along the beach.

Or you go skiing while the sun sets.

On blue-bird days the summits can be busy.

But there's enough fjords so you can have one for yourself to enjoy the sunset.
