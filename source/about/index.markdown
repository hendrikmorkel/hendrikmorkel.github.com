Hei! 

My name is Hendrik Morkel, and I am the author of Hiking in Finland. A European by heart I live since 2002 in Finland, though my parents are Dutch & German. I started this blog in the spring of 2009, after reading many interesting outdoor blogs and being inspired by them. Seeing that there was no blog about backpacking in Finland which is in English, I took the duty upon myself to represent this beautiful country and show what it has to offer to backpackers, climbers, bikepackers, skiers and packrafters. You will read here about my adventures in Finland, Sweden, Norway and the rest of Europe, gear reviews, videos and interviews with UL cottage manufacturers.

If I am not outdoors I'm most likely writing about it, as I started in 2010 to write for various publications. Nowadays I'm a Gear Editor at [trekking Magazin](http://trekkingmagazin.com/) and contribute occassionally to [NORR](http://www.norrmagazin.de/), two popular German-language outdoor magazines. I also occassionally write for English publications, and have published my first book, a guide book about the [Pirkan Taival Trail](http://amzn.to/Y9r5yz).
