<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>Five years ago, on the 25th of April 2010, <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2010/04/the-week-in-review.html">the first The Week in Review</a> saw the light. I had been blogging for a bit over a year by then, was following a growing number of outdoor blogs and felt it was difficult to <strong>separate the weekend hill walk from the epic adventures</strong> (there’s nothing wrong with weekend hill walks, btw - I love these myself!) - and so the first weekly outdoor-related curated post was born. The idea was pretty straight forward: Share with my readers the other great &amp; useful, fun and inspiring outdoor content on other blogs I read (and they maybe not (yet)). Hiking in Finland was back then already quite popular and as <strong>sharing is caring</strong> I thought it’s useful to give some other blogs some love, too. </p>

<p>It always has been pretty roughly 50% subjective and 50% objective content that found its way into TWIR, content that I liked a lot and content that I knew you, the readers will find useful. This often included skills, Tips &amp; Tricks and gear reviews - finding believable and high-quality reviews on ultralight gear has not been easy and still can be difficult. The same goes for inspiring trip reports - it can be hard to find some real pearls.</p>

<p>There have been a handful of <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2015/03/the-week-in-review-clxxxxvii.html">Mystery Editions</a>, one <a href="https://flipboard.com/@hendrikmorkel/the-week-in-review-xxxvi-pfh7659jy">TWIR on Flipboard</a> and 199 other awesome TWIRs. You can <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/the-week-in-review/">browse them all here</a> (<em>There’s some problems with the earliest TWIRs because of the URLs - happened when moving from Blogspot to Octopress - which I am working on a fix</em>).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17022136640" title="Swell by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7688/17022136640_d5349517b6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Swell" /></a></p>

<h2 id="blogs-blogs-blogs">Blogs Blogs Blogs</h2>

<p>From the beginning TWIR was <strong>highlighting content on outdoor blogs</strong>. The first blogs in my RSS Reader were probably from my fellow Nordic Lightpacking friends: <a href="http://nielsenbrown.com/">Roger</a>, <a href="https://thunderinthenight.exposure.co/">Joe</a>, <a href="http://www.fjaderlatt.se/">Martin &amp; Jörgen</a>, <a href="http://thebearablelightness.blogspot.fi/">Gustav</a>, <a href="http://www.backpackingnorth.com/">Mark</a> and <a href="http://goinglighter.blogspot.fi/">Thomas</a> followed by blogs from the UK, Germany, Europe, Australia, Asia and of course the USA. The number of blogs in my RSS reader started to grow quickly, though, and nowadays there’s close to 800 blogs in my subscription list. The last one I added is <a href="https://limitcamper.wordpress.com/">Limitcamper</a>, and each week a couple more are subscribed to.</p>

<p>While in the beginning it was a manageable task - blogging was just going down in popularity again in 2010/ 2011 - it quickly started to be a full-day task to keep track of all the superb content. Nowadays, if I don’t already browse during the week a bit in the RSS Reader, I easily can have 500 or more unread items on a Sunday waiting for me. I also try to vary the blogs I feature - even if some people create outstanding content each week (you should subscribe to their blogs to not miss a thing!) it is more interesting so find something fresh from someone new each week.</p>

<p>What RSS Reader I use has changed also, from the now-death Google Reader over Reeder I now am using the fantastic <a href="https://feedbin.com/">Feedbin</a>, which I highly recommend if you read blogs via RSS.</p>

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/125476007?color=ffffff&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/">Photos</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Habichtshorst">Videos</a> have always been a part of The Week In Review. <strong>The internet is a visual medium</strong> and sharing great photos and videos not just loosens up the structure but also makes it more attractive. But more structure was needed and became gradually part of TWIR. It was <a href="https://twitter.com/rollofunk">Mikael</a> who suggested I number the issues for easier reference, and that’s the reason we can have a cake with two hundred candles on it today =)</p>

<p>While the superb content on other blogs is still the core of each TWIR, nowadays also news, gear deals and interesting announcements are part of it. This meant I needed to find a better way to separate News from Trip Reports and Gear Reviews - which gave rise to the sub-headers. This makes it also easier for the readers to go directly to the section they are interested in, or when looking something up to find it more easily. So besides great content from Outdoor blogs you now also can find interesting posts from major newspapers and other outdoor media.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>When you talk, you are only repeating what you already know. But if you listen, you may learn something new.</em> - Dalai Lama</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And because I follow blogs from across the globe and often include blogs in another language in the TWIR, it was <a href="https://twitter.com/korpijaakko">Jaakko</a> who suggested I add also a short [Language] tag behind those posts that are in another language than English. The final additions have been the last <em>“Share it with your friends”</em> sentence, encouraging you to let your friends know about the TWIR, and an inspiring, thoughtful quote as the intro. There have been suggestions to sort articles by activity - packrafting, hiking, climbing and cycling - though I feel that’s not needed right now. And clicking on an inspiring bike-touring article as a hiker certainly can’t harm, but only open the mind!</p>

<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>

<p>Back in 2009 a bunch of mates set out on a <a href="http://www.tetongravity.com/forums/showthread.php?t=169211">33 days in Wrangell St. Elias National Park adventure</a> which still today is an EPIC in the truest sense of the word.</p>

<p>Joery’s adventures also are good in my memory, like his <a href="http://dzjow.com/2012/10/08/protect-the-peel-first-pics/">Peel Watershed Hiking &amp; Packrafting Trip</a>.</p>

<p>Also Willem’s <a href="https://willemvandoorne.wordpress.com/2014/01/25/greenland-part-iv-a-loop-into-cape-farewell-country/">Greenland adventure</a> ranks high in my memory.</p>

<p>And if I already mention Joery and Willem obviously Steve &amp; Katrijn can’t miss because they make the Belgian trio complete. Their world trip, especially their <a href="http://patagoniandreams.com/2013/05/06/patagonia-un-paseo-otonal-entre-la-roca-el-hielo-y-la-lenga/">trips in Patagonia</a>, have me looking up flights and thinking schedules for a trip there.</p>

<p>And finally, the <a href="http://distantranges.com/in-the-golden-mountains-of-altai-part-1/">In the Golden Mountains of Altai</a> trip report has me certain that I need to go to Russia for some hiking and packrafting.</p>

<p>But there have been many, many more memorable posts, so you really should <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/the-week-in-review/">browse the past TWIRs</a>. Comment underneath and let me know which was your favourite story that you found via The Week In Review!</p>

<h2 id="the-future">The Future</h2>

<p>The Week In Review, 200 issues, five years old. As a friend asked this morning: Did I think this would happen? Nope. I’m also still surprised by the mass of people who read it and love it, for whom TWIR is their daily stop on a Sunday or Monday, where they <strong>find inspiring and beautiful outdoor stories</strong> and stay informed on what’s happening in the outdoor blog-o-sphere.</p>

<p>While there have been moments where I have felt like <em>Today’s not a TWIR day</em> these have been fewer and fewer thanks to effective management of how I write and organize them. Which means The Week In Review is here to stay, and I am looking forward to bringing you more inspiring outdoor stories in the years to come. And if I miss a Sunday - it’s usually because I’m out backpacking, packrafting, climbing or bikepacking myself =) </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s weekend so its time to head outdoors, to the cabin. Got none? <a href="http://shop.gestalten.com/books/hide-seek.html">Hide and Seek - The Architecture of Cabins and Hide-Outs</a> will give you plenty of cabins to dream of over the weekend and inspire you to dream up your own.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17066651669" title="Hide and Seek - The Architecture of Cabins and Hide-Outs by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7606/17066651669_6213274751_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Hide and Seek - The Architecture of Cabins and Hide-Outs" /></a></p>

<p>Friday is the day where the mind starts to wander to a lonely log cabin in the woods, by the lake, heated by a wood stove, no electricity. Or is it more a luxurious cabin by the sea? Maybe a sleek mountain hut that looks old and ramshackle from the outside but that’s modern and cool inside? <a href="http://shop.gestalten.com/books/hide-seek.html">Hide and Seek - The Architecture of Cabins and Hide-Outs</a> has them all: Coastal cabins, mountain cabins, open range cabins and the wood cabin, nicely sorted into four chapters of the finest cabins the authors could find. And they have searched far and wide, from the Isle of Skye to New Zealand and Finland to Chile, there’s bound to be a cabin for everyone in this book, Gestalten’s 2nd Cabin book after <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/rock-the-shack.html">Rock the Shack</a>.</p>

<p>The book presents the cabins &amp; their interiors of people who don’t want to give up life in the city but want to be able to escape to nature. And as unique as we are as humans, so unique are the cabins, their surroundings and interiors in this book. The focus clearly is on small living spaces in nature, because the outside in front of the window is your living room in many cases, your entertainment, TV and internet. The book aims to inspire you to dream up your own cabin, but you’ll not find plans or construction tips in this coffee table book. However, in the index at the end of the book you can find out more about the architects of the cabins, so that gives you a good starting point.</p>

<p>Sadly we don’t have a own cabin by the sea or lake, so a book which inspires the mind for a more simple life away from home certainly is a good way to relax. I found the book interesting, though I saw a trend to very minimalistic, modern, almost similar looking cabins - with just the scenery changing from the coast to the mountains to the forests. There was a lot of wood, concrete, steel and stones used, all in similar shapes &amp; designs, often with straight lines. Standing out were really only Steve’s Thailand Dome House, the Tree Tent, the Cocoon and the Tree Snake Houses in terms of its design - that was fresh &amp; organic architecture. While I liked most cabins in the book, I missed more organic, natural and rustic cabins and interiors - which there shouldn’t be a shortage of. Personally I also would have liked a more inhabited look in the interior photos, many had the sterile-looking feel of a Modern Art Museum.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17065096818" title="Hide and Seek - The Architecture of Cabins and Hide-Outs by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7601/17065096818_c322948cab_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Hide and Seek - The Architecture of Cabins and Hide-Outs" /></a></p>

<p>Despite this I would recommend this coffee table book to anyone who likes huts &amp; cabins and can’t get enough of them. You’re bound to have seen some of the featured hide-outs in the book if you follow <a href="http://cabinporn.com/">Cabinporn</a> but there’s a host of new &amp; fresh cabins featured which will get you dreaming about a weekend (or life!) away in them. It’s a beautiful book with high-quality paper and photographs, very legible typography and a clear layout which makes for a satisfying experience when reading &amp; browsing. There’s all in all 80 cabins and hide-outs in the book on 250 pages, and the nature &amp; scenery around the hide-outs and cabins is just as gorgeous as the huts themselves. I’m now off to dream up my own hut, if you need some weekend inspiration grab the book at your local book store or order it online from <a href="http://shop.gestalten.com/books/hide-seek.html">Gestalten</a>, <a href="http://amzn.to/1KbYSiH">Amazon.com</a>, <a href="http://amzn.to/1duc68Y">Amazon.co.uk</a> or <a href="http://amzn.to/1ElTl8s">Amazon.de</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16603773563" title="Bike &amp; Travel Magazine 01/2015 by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7611/16603773563_614d0ea74e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Bike &amp; Travel Magazine 01/2015" /></a></p>

<p>The <a href="http://biketravel-magazin.com/">Bike &amp; Travel Magazine</a> hit the shelves last week, but together with the publisher I have been working since spring 2014 on this new magazine. It was one of the reasons for me to get a couple of new <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/11/pelago-bicycles-stavanger.html">bikes</a> and it has been an interesting ride to see a new magazine being born. I will contribute to the magazine for at least the next two years, so if you like my writing you might want to <a href="https://ssl.topackt.com/trekkingmagazin.com/bikeabo/abo_eingabe.php?AboArt=ZweiJahresabo">take out a subscription</a> and don’t miss any issue. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17036201878" title="Bike &amp; Travel Magazine 01/2015 by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7705/17036201878_11a7108d95_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Bike &amp; Travel Magazine 01/2015" /></a></p>

<p>For this issue I contributed an article on comfortable sleeping along the trail/ road and lament that many people seem to be using massive tents and camping gear - the reasoning seems to be that many traditional bike-tourers think along the lines of <em>“I don’t need to carry it and have plenty of space”</em> - I showcase gear from the opposite side of the spectrum (so it’s light, compact and just as comfortable). Future articles will continue along these lines and also include a few nice bike tours in Europe. </p>

<p>The main focus of the magazine is on the adventures and tours you can do with your bike. The magazine has eight trip reports in the inaugural issue and is set to continue along these lines - there’s enough cycling gear magazines on the market already, and as <a href="http://www.fastcoexist.com/3043858/world-changing-ideas/the-science-of-why-you-should-spend-your-money-on-experiences-not-thing">research shows</a> - experiences are more valuable than the stuff you own. In that sense, grab the first issue of <a href="http://biketravel-magazin.com/">Bike &amp; Travel</a>, swing a leg over your bike and go for a ride!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ashfall Quartz. Ebb. Tide. Swell. Mix it together, throw in a rubber dinghy and you have the stuff for a Sea Stack climbing adventure.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17002240157" title="The sea worthy vessel to cross over to the sea stack by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7626/17002240157_6342150a0a_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="The sea worthy vessel to cross over to the sea stack" /></a></p>

<p>From the distance Berg Stack looks like a wee little rock in the North Atlantic Ocean, just off the cost of An Port in County Donegal, Ireland. We - Iain, our guide, a photographer and an US American journalist - slept the last night in the Port Cottage and now a blue sky &amp; sunshine have us frolicking in the superb weather. <em>“Lets go and check out the swell and tide”</em> Iain announces. We pack up our climbing gear and the 40€ rubber dinghy, bought at a Toy Shop - three at a time, they’re not that durable and walk the <a href="http://www.walkni.com/iat/">IAT</a> path up to the sea stack.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16589476163" title="Berg Stack on the right, Vertical Picnic stack on the left by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8697/16589476163_e1526639df_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Berg Stack on the right, Vertical Picnic stack on the left" /></a></p>

<p>What looked like a wee sea stack from the lawn of the cottage turns out to be a 25 m high sea stack with a large ledge at the bottom, beautiful cracks and pin scars lining it from bottom to top and a Great black-backed gull with its nest on top. Oh, and an angry Atlantic Ocean with a two to four metre swell, making for not a good time to cross. We still inflate the unnamed dinghy, Iain gives me the instructions of how to assist him when he will board the sea worthy vessel to establish a tyrollean traverse on Berg Stack so I can get over, too.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17023512169" title="Iain from Unique Ascents having a look at the sea, Berg Stack in the background by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8693/17023512169_4922bee743_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Iain from Unique Ascents having a look at the sea, Berg Stack in the background" /></a></p>

<p>The we sit &amp; wait. Observe the swell. Finally Iain decides we’ll come back at high tide later in the afternoon, when the sea should be calmer. Adrenaline that was build up in anticipation disappears, shoes go back on and we go for a nice hill walk, checking out Cnoc na Mara - the Sea Stack we had originally planned to go up, but with this sea that would have been too much risk. The views are spectacular, the valley deserted and I can make out a dozen of superb spots for a wild camp.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17021928808" title="A look up Berg Stack by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5322/17021928808_206ed924b5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="A look up Berg Stack" /></a></p>

<p>Sea stack climbing is less about climbing, really. Sure, it helps if you can climb well and know how to place gear - it’s all trad - but it is just as much about the skill set an Alpinist has: Patience, Risk Assessment, Speed &amp; Efficiency. Maritime skills &amp; knowledge are also essential, knowing when the tide is coming in, how high the swell is, if it is safe, being patient. Finally, a bit of daring for an adventure is also needed. After all, if you think paddling in a toyshop rubber dinghy on the Atlantic is insane, then sea stack climbing is nothing for you.</p>

<p>We’re back on the main land and observe the sea. It is high tide, the swell is still high but every now &amp; then there’s a calm moment - and one of these Iain uses to paddle over to Berg Stack. An euphoric cry echoes over the sea and you can see how a load is off his shoulders. He sets up an anchor for the tyrollean traverse, and during the next calm moment he’s back on the main land. We discuss the strategy and then it all goes quick: the dinghy is back in the water and Iain is in it, surfing the swell, a 240 cm sling connecting him to the tyrollean. A calm moment comes, he paddles in and I jump in - and just as quick out again off on Berg Stack. We both howl a cry of victory, a victory over the tide and swell.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17021935758" title="Berg Stack by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5343/17021935758_1ab7fb492e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Berg Stack" /></a></p>

<p>From here on it’s all basic rock climbing: Harness and rock shoes come on, Iain racks up and we tie into the rope. I stand barefoot on the ledge, the swell crashing on the rocks around. Iain leads up a variation the <em>Cormorant</em> which he probably has climbed a dozen times and before long an “Off belay” call echoes down to me. It is a nice route with great hand and foot holds up till the middle to the arête, then it goes around the arête and up a wet corner, which is also the toilet of the Great black-backed gull and its offspring which were kind enough to let us top out there. A moment later I stand on the top of Berg Stack next to Iain, high-fiving him, and again we both let out a howl of victory. But this is not a sports climb where you just clip into the chain and then rappel off. No, this is a sea stack. And the sea is angry.</p>

<p>The easiest way off the top back to the ledge is to down-climb a corner to about two meters above the rushing sea, and then traverse the sea stack on superb ledges &amp; holds back to where we started. We short-rope and five minutes later stand next to our dinghy. The sea is lower, more rocks can be seen as the ebb comes in, but the swell is still high. <em>“Lets wait till the tide is out and then walk off”</em> Iain says, and so we deflate the dinghy which has served us so well on the way here, pack up and wait. Wait for the water to retreat, for the swell to let us escape from this rock.</p>

<p>The sea does not see a reason for letting us off, it wants to keep us. The swell is high and white foam rushes over the barnacle-covered rocks, which would otherwise allow us to easily walk off. The sun throws its last rays on the main land, we can see the hut from our ledge and the comfort of the warm fire in the cozy cottage and slowly we’re getting cold &amp; hungry. Low tide arrives, but the swell still throws up large, foamy waves over the rocks we should have just walked off.</p>

<p>Iain goes first, jumps the large gap and makes it just to the top of a big rock when a wave comes in. He brings me my approach shoes and throws them over, as I do not fancy jumping barefoot on wet, slimy rocks and risking a broken ankle. Waiting for the right moment I too make the jump, and a final victory cry echoes from the rocks - the land has me again. We pack up and in the falling dusk walk to the cottage, where a warm fire and cool beer are waiting for us. My appetite for sea stack climbing is awakened, but first I’ll need to hike further on the International Appalachian Trail to Northern Ireland, to return another day for more sea stack climbing adventures.</p>

<h2 id="practicalities">Practicalities</h2>
<p>There’s a <a href="http://www.uniqueascent.ie/sea_stack_guide">free Sea Stack Guide book</a> if you want to go sea stack climbing - it has almost all sea stacks in it. A selection of sea stacks you also find in the <a href="http://threerockbooks.com/index.php/rock-climbing-in-ireland/">Rock Climbing in Ireland</a> book. I would suggest you do your first sea stack with Iain from <a href="http://www.uniqueascent.ie/">Unique Ascents</a> and learn the ins &amp; outs from him about the sea and getting safely on and off the sea stack. He’s also a great guy and you’ll have a lot of fun on a day out with him. You’ll need a sea-worthy vessel - maybe <a href="http://www.packrafting-store.de/Rentals:::34.html">loan a packraft</a>, but be sure you also know how to use it and have an idea about the tide, swell and weather forecast. If a sea stack is too much adventure, check out the <a href="http://www.uniqueascent.ie/undiscovered_donegal">Donegal rock climbers guide</a> and visit one of the local crags, though there are also <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CfM3DTcHcS8">calm days on Berg Stack</a>.</p>

<p>If you plan to climb in the area around An Port stay in the <a href="http://port-donegal.com/">Port Donegal Cottage</a> - either book via their website or on <a href="http://www.ownersdirect.co.uk/accommodation/p8069109">Owners Direct</a>. It has a wonderful cozy feel and relaxing in the bathtub after a day out on the sea will be so good that you don’t wanna go out. It sleeps eight and with some luck Roland, the owner, will be around and delight you with his stories from far away places.</p>

<p>The nearest village via a road is Ardara where you find several accommodation options like the <a href="http://www.bayviewcountryhouse.com/">Bayview Country House</a> and also shops and the <a href="http://www.nancysardara.com/">Nancy’s of Ardara Pub</a> for a after-climb pint, though it adds at least 45 minutes driving to your approach. For rest days go to Glencolmcille in the neighbouring valley and visit the <a href="http://glenfolkvillage.com/">Folk Museum</a> where you can see how people lived in the last centuries in the area, grab a good cup of coffee and a bite.</p>

<p>Gear wise you will need Trad gear as there are no bolts. Bring cord and slings if you want to abseil and need to build an anchor. Most of all, be patient with the sea and be open for the adventure!</p>

<p>I love climbing, and the <a href="http://www.camp.it/EN/template01.aspx?codicemenu=1475">CAMP Supernova</a> was my try to get my wife fall in love with it too. With the Supernova Harness being a harness conceived by women, designed by women, and built for women I thought this will be the harness for her, and while she did like the lightweight and comfortable harness she isn’t as obsessed about climbing as me. M liked the padding and ease of adjustment of the harness, with a fully adjustable waist and leg loops, and the No-Twist belay loop came in handy when she was belaying me. / 360 g in Size M</p>

<p>Gloves, the eternal struggle. If all you need gloves for is that they keep your fingers warm and look good you’re a lucky person and won’t understand the “Search for the perfect glove” that outdoor enthusiasts, and especially ice climbers, conduct. The <a href="https://hestragloves.com/sport/intl/gloves/mountaineering/ergo-grip-outdry-dexterity-long-five-finger/100100/">Hestra Ergo Grip OutDry Dexterity Long</a> is as close to the perfect ice climbing and mountaineering glove I have come, me thinks. It is warm, waterproof with an OutDry membrane, offers superb dexterity and is very, very durable. I have used this fine glove for two winters now and some mountaineering and love it. It’s easy to clip ropes, open ‘biners, conduct fiddly work and keep warm fingers, even when water is running down the shaft of your ice tools. / 186 g for the Pair in Size 9</p>

<p>294 in that name stands for the 294 steel studs with carbide pins on these tires, which makes these <em>the</em> cycling tires for icy conditions - and thanks to the triple thaw + freeze cycles we had this “<em>winter</em>” (and the last one, too) the <a href="http://www.suomityres.com/eng/tyres/">Gazza Extreme</a> have been very, very useful. Suomi Tyres is a small company from Eastern Finland and they know how to make some of the best bicycle tires on the planet - they are since 90 years in this business. They’re the only bicycle tyre manufacturer in Northern Europe (check this <a href="https://youtu.be/lxYa4Lb3VRI?list=UUl1rmXRFLvoJlm4E8UirZVw">video of how the tires are made</a>) and produce since ten years already environmentally sound tires from pure rubber compounds. I have ridden the Gazza Extreme on my 29er in the last two winters and didn’t slip once with them on icy roads and frozen lakes. These tires are on the bike a good five to six months a year and so far have yet to lose one stud! / 1090 g per tyre</p>

<p>Back to boots! Well, not really, but for Nordic Skating and Backcountry XC Skiing the <a href="http://lundhags.se/">Lundhags</a> BC Guide Boots have been fantastic. The shoe was out of the box comfortable, in part probably thanks to the 3 mm wool felt liner boot which can be removed. The boot itself is made from a Perwanger split leather on top which has been great in shedding water and snow and keeping my feet dry, and a Certech 4.5 cellular rubber as a midlayer, with a Rottefella® BC sole underneath which allows you to click into NNN bindings - be these on skis or Nordic Skates is up to you! The laces are long but allowed me to fit the boot well to my feet, and the boot is well insulated against the cold from below so that your feet stay toasty when you’re out on the ice.

I wore my <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2012/03/finisterre-zephyr-boxer-shorts.html">Finisterre Boxers</a> till they were broken and the Anatomica have been a worthy replacement. The colours and fit are spot on, sometimes I find the waistband folds over (for example when cycling or climbing) but overall these have been great. The Merino wool makes these my choice of underwear on backpacking trips as you can wear them for several days and they stay fresh, and the flatlock seams &amp; thin material make them very comfortable on the trail. / 51 g in Size M</p>

I found it especially useful in winter when I need to wear my phone close to my body so it stays warm - the battery drains like nothing in the cold - but it can get wet from my sweat. The case has been 100% waterproof thus far and the transparent front lets me operate the phone in it without problems. There’s even a transparent back window so you can take photos through it, and as far as those go I do find the results are satisfactorily.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The common human relationship with winter seems to go like this: As a child you love winter. In your twenties you could life without it. And from your thirties onwards you fall in love with winter &amp; snow again. In our family we’re all winter lovers, and as winter didn’t really visit us in Vaasa we decided to find it up north at <a href="http://ski.pyha.fi/eng/">Pyhä Tunturi</a>.</p>

<h2 id="prologue">Prologue</h2>

<p>Climate change is a real bummer for winter lovers in Southern Finland. While I did get to ski and fatbike in the snow a bit back home, winter in Vaasa was a mix of snow + cold and then rain + warm temperatures which resulted in a less than nice winter. With a week of winter vacation that we could each take of, M and me decided to search winter in Lapland. After some discussions of what we wanted we quickly settled on the <a href="http://ski.pyha.fi/eng/">Pyhä Ski Resort</a> as the best destination for us this year as it had plenty of fun winter activities to offer for all three of us, from skiing and hiking over sledding to ice climbing and fatbiking, with great <a href="http://ski.pyha.fi/accommodation/">accommodation</a> options, too. </p>

<p>A car was rented, <a href="www.airbnb.com/c/hmorkel?s=8">AirBnB accommodation</a> in Oulu was organized and the luggage was packed. It was a nice Sunday morning as we started the drive north, and it was around Oulu - 300 km from Vaasa - that we saw the first signs of Winter again. The next day we continued via a stop in Rovaniemi onwards to Pyhä, and already from a distance we could see the iconic fjells of the ski resort and <a href="http://www.outdoors.fi/pyha-luostonp">National Park</a>, with lots of snow around us and a beautiful bluebird sky promising a great week of winter fun! We checked in to the <a href="http://www.pyha.fi/summer/accommodation/?file=target_exec&amp;id=1128&amp;submenu=3657">Ski-Inn PyhäSuites Apartment</a>, heated up the Sauna and enjoyed seeing the stars in the crisp, black sky.</p>

<h2 id="winter-fun-for-kids">Winter fun for Kids</h2>

<p>We found Pyhä a great location for our three year old. He loved the snow and we were daily at the sled hill, which was a five minutes walk from the <a href="http://www.luontoon.fi/pyha-luostonluontokeskus">Nature Centre Naava</a> (which is in the centre of the village and hence an easy reference point). The two sled hills were good fun and E didn’t get tired of sledding for many hours each day, with little rest breaks at the conveniently located open hut at the foot of the hill. Being allowed to throw another log of wood on the fire was equally nice as making snow angles and sledding together <em>superfast</em> with dad. </p>

<p>There’s a ski school for kids in Pyhä too, though we decided to wait for another year to put him on downhill skis. There were lots of kids skiing, though, and the Family slopes were full with parents and kids of all ages. Close to our apartment was also a reindeer enclosure and visiting Rudolph and his friends was every time again fascinating. E also enjoyed looking how other people skied down the hills so fast, and going up with the Polar Express to the top of the fjell made him smile from ear to ear. </p>

<h2 id="skiing">Skiing</h2>

<p>M and me have the same shoe size, which was convenient as we loaned cross country skis and boots. M enjoyed skiing the tracks while I went a bit off-piste and explored the nearby National Park and swamp on skis. There’s surely a hundred kilometre or more of groomed cross-country skiing tracks at Pyhä and M liked the little huts and Laavus along the tracks, as they were ideal to have a short break and then ski back. The tracks vary in difficulty, from a super easy loipe that goes around a mire with zero elevations to more demanding loipes. You even can ski around the whole Pyhä-Luosto National Park on groomed tracks, which is - depending on the route you choose - between 70 or more kilometres. For early morning and late night skiers there’s also a pretty long illuminated track which is lighted up from 6 in the morning till 23 at night.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17075080162" title="Skiing by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8687/17075080162_2149394d66_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Skiing" /></a></p>

<p>But of course cross-country skiing is just one sort of skiing you can do in Pyhä! It’s very well known in Finland to be <em>the</em> Backcountry destination, as you can take the lift up and then pretty much ski down where you please. Sadly my <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2015/03/ispo-2015-news-3.html">DPS Tour 1 skis</a> didn’t arrive in time otherwise I would have been out on the slopes and made some pretty turns after skinning up the hills. There are lots of great ski-touring options at Pyhä, so if that’s your kind of skiing make sure to take your gear along! Also for downhill and Freeskiers Pyhä is a great destination, with 9 lifts, 14 prepared slopes - the longest slope being 1800 m - and the same ski pass being valid at Ruka as well Pyhä is a great destination to go snowboarding and skiing. Add in that the lifts are working super efficient and queues were non-existent and you have the ingredients for lots of skiing and fun.</p>

<h2 id="ice-climbing">Ice climbing</h2>

<p>One of the reasons why Pyhä won for us as a destination is that you can go <a href="http://www.blissadventure.fi/en/ice-climbing/customized-ice-climbing/">ice climbing at Tajukangas</a> which is a short stroll from the slopes and the Pyhätunturi Hotel. My friends from <a href="http://www.blissadventure.fi/en/">Bliss Adventure</a> run the ice climbing crag there, and I was very happy that my friend <a href="http://aleksimehtonen.fi/">Aleksi</a> and his colleague Mikko were there with me and were the belay masters while I was whacking some ice. And whacking ice I did!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16454119254" title="My first ice lead at Tajukangas by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7665/16454119254_4f6f3c878e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="My first ice lead at Tajukangas" /></a></p>

<p>After a couple of warm-ups and checking out the routes I did my first ice lead ever, and while I was a bit nervous while tying in to my <a href="http://www.bergzeit.fi/en/mammut-genesis-8-5-half-rope-red/?pid=81">Mammut 8.5 Genesis Ropes</a> and racking up the new <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.co.uk/petzl-laser-speed-ice-screw/">Petzl Laser Speed ice screws</a> as soon as I was on the ice and put my mind on the task ahead the fear was gone, tranquility and enjoyment flowing through me. As far as ice leads go this wasn’t the most difficult route ever, though I found the company and encouragement from Aleksi &amp; Mikko superb and they helped me to trust myself and lead on ice. Now I’m hungry for more and hope that next winter will be much better than this one, so that there will be much more ice climbing and leading!</p>

<h2 id="hungry">Hungry?</h2>

<p><a href="http://pyhawurst.fi/">Pyhä Wurst</a> is a cozy little Restaurant/ Café at the bottom of the Northern Slope. They serve, as the name suggest, a variety of different sausages, and all three of us really found our food extremely tasty. Our son devoured a Hotdog - his first one! - and would have liked a second one, while M and me enjoyed a Bratwurst Hotdog and a Riistakäristys. They place was very popular with skiers &amp; snowboarders, walkers, cross-country skiers and families alike, so check them out when you’re in Pyhä and would like to taste some good Wurst!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17050601976" title="PyhäWurst by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8732/17050601976_5f89cb12f4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="PyhäWurst" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.cafeloimu.fi/en/">Café Loimu</a> was another Café which we enjoyed visiting almost daily as they served some super-tasty pancakes and good coffee. They’re located in the same building as the Nature Centre Naava so kids can even go and explore the museum on their own while the parents can enjoy a moment in the Café. Café Loimu is right in the middle of the village and also has an Á la carte Menu if you want to eat a bit more than pancakes or a sandwich.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://ski.pyha.fi/restaurants/?file=target_exec&amp;id=1019&amp;submenu=138">Hotel Pyhätunturi Restaurant</a> has a gorgeous Panorama view over the surroundings and is an ideal place to conclude a nice day outdoors, especially if the Northern Lights decide to show up and play a show over the forests and mires. M ate the best Sautéed reindeer (<em>poronkäristys</em> in Finnish) in her life at the Restaurant and found it so tasty that she still talks about how good it was. I enjoyed <em>The Poro</em> which was equally delicious, while E had problems finishing his kids meal of spaghetti and meatballs. The atmosphere and service at the Hotel Pyhätunturi Restaurant were excellent and if you stay in Pyhä we strongly recommend that you visit the restaurant.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16457137153" title="The Poro by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8686/16457137153_4fe83a661d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="659" alt="The Poro" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.huttu-uula.fi/">Restaurant Huttu-Uula</a> has won an Chaîne des Rôtisseurs award and is located at the foot of the Polar slope. Every Thursday it serves a <a href="http://www.huttu-uula.fi/files/uula_puffee.pdf">Lappish Food Buffet</a> with lots of delicious dishes from Lapland. The friendly atmosphere together with the good buffet food make this a recommended visit on a Thursday evening, though you should reserve well in advance as the Buffet is very popular and was fully booked out when we were there.</p>

<h2 id="fatbiking">Fatbiking</h2>

<p>Since I got my <a href="http://salsacycles.com/bikes/mukluk">Fatbike</a> cycling has been a lot of fun in winter. Riding over the frozen Baltic Sea, shredding over the single track in the forest and doing laps on the groomed trails are just a lot of fun, so of course I took the opportunity to go on a <a href="http://www.blissadventure.fi/en/fatbikes/">Fatbike Adventure at Pyhä</a>. I was very lucky that my friend Artturi was my guide for the morning, and after familiarizing myself with bike and hearing what Artturi had planned for us we hit the trails.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16888790748" title="Fatbiking, skiing or hiking? by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7676/16888790748_0235d89209_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Fatbiking, skiing or hiking?" /></a></p>

<p>After some beautiful, flow-y single track trails we arrived at a large mire which was a lot of fun to ride across. We had a short break at a bird watching tower which allowed for wide views over the National Park, before continuing across the mire - fat tires rock in that terrain! Slowly narrow tracks brought us back to our starting point, and after a nice climb back up to the Hotel this little Fatbike adventure was done. You also can rent a Fatbike for half a day or longer from Bliss in case you want to explore the National Park on your own. Hats off to Bliss Adventure for offering this service, I think they’re spot on with it and I saw daily very happy fatbike cyclists riding on the trails and snow.</p>

<h2 id="snowshoe-hiking">(Snowshoe) Hiking</h2>

<p>There is a dedicated <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2010/01/video-msr-lightning-ascent-review.html">snowshoe</a> hiking trail in Pyhä, though it was so hard packed that one didn’t need snowshoes to walk on it. So we had a nice little family hike to the Isokuru gorge and back, which includes a steep descent and climb from the nice Isokuru Kota. The hike seems to take the route of the summer nature trail as we passed quite a few signs which gave information about the forest and land, and is ideal if you’d like to be outdoors for a couple of hours. </p>

<h2 id="nature--silence">Nature &amp; Silence</h2>

<p>Despite all the activities you can do in Pyhä, there are two things in Pyhä-Luosto everywhere, and they’re for free: Nature and Silence. Even with a Baltic Ski Cup going on while we were in the village, we just needed to walk for five minutes towards the <a href="http://www.outdoors.fi/en/pyha-luostonp">National Park</a> and there was a calmness that was just once in a while interrupted by birdsong or the wind blowing through the trees. Pyhä-Luosto National Park is home to the southern most big fjells in Finland, beyond them towards the south starts the flat land. Though this does make them popular I had at no time the feeling that there were too much people around me, for example the lines at the lifts were pretty much non-existent despite there being a bunch of people, and also in the Cafés and Restaurants there were never masses of people. As someone who values silence a lot I found Pyhä a great place, with easy access to nature and the possibility to <em>“escape”</em> the main slopes and head into the National Park, where even on blue bird days I didn’t meet more than a handful of people. </p>

<h2 id="practicalities">Practicalities</h2>

<p><strong>Where to stay?</strong></p>

<p>We stayed at a <a href="http://www.ski-inn.fi/majoitus.asp?prodtype=30&amp;lang=eng&amp;tunturi=&amp;day=&amp;endDay=">Ski-Inn PyhäSuites Apartment</a> which was ideally located right next to the slopes. The apartment was super family-friendly and had two bedrooms, a small kitchen, living room, balcony, a own Sauna and a drying cabinet to dry wet garments and gear (super handy with kids!). There are plenty more options in town, from the nice <a href="http://www.ski-inn.fi/majoitus.asp?prodtype=41&amp;lang=eng&amp;tunturi=&amp;changeMonth=">Ski-Inn Hotel Pyhätunturi</a> to many, many cozy <a href="http://www.pyha.fi/summer/accommodation/?file=cabins&amp;submenu=3660">cabins</a> and even a <a href="http://www.pyha.fi/summer/accommodation/?file=target_exec&amp;id=1106">caravan site</a> if you’re coming with your own accommodation. You’ll surely find something to your liking, keep an eye out for deals, though, as at e.g. the Ski-Inn PyhäSuites Apartments ski passes can be included in the price saving you a bunch of money!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16869175557" title="PyhäSuites by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7703/16869175557_09002a90bf_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="PyhäSuites" /></a></p>

<p><strong>How to get there?</strong></p>

<p>As we don’t own a car we rented one for a week and drove up north. Vaasa - Pyhä is around 660 km and with a toddler along we decided to split the journey in two and spend a night in Oulu. If you come from abroad you might want to fly directly to Rovaniemi and take the <a href="http://www.pyha.fi/summer/info/?file=content_exec&amp;id=2292&amp;submenu=3890">SkiBus</a> to Pyhä, or take the (overnight) train from Helsinki and then jump on the SkiBus. In the village you can walk pretty much everywhere within 15 minutes, and there’s a variety of shops to suit your needs.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Open Wilderness Huts, Laavus, Kotas and Fireplaces are something I dearly love about the outdoors experience in Finland. It’s just very sophisticated to be able to plan a backpacking trip and rely on laavus and huts for sleeping, or know that there will be a fireplace in the mid point of the hike for a nice lunch break by the fire. <a href="http://www.tulikartta.fi/">Tulikartta.fi</a> set out to index all public shelters - from Laavus and Kotas over Wilderness Huts to Fireplaces - in one easy to use map, which makes it an excellent tool to plan an overnighter!</p>

<p>In the past and still in the present <a href="http://www.outdoors.fi/">Outdoors.fi</a> and <a href="http://www.retkikartta.fi/">Retkikartta.fi</a> have been the digital services I have used to plan a trip in Finland. The former lists all National Parks, Wilderness and Hiking Areas in the country, with information on history, how to get there, history and services available. Retkikartta is a highly detailed map which you can use to create routes, measure distances and look up coordinates to huts up to a scale of 1:2500, save and print out directly from the browser or export to your <a href="http://bit.ly/1Dk1sCb">GPS device</a>.</p>

<p>This is a good way to plan a backpacking trip, but if you wanted to find a shelter for a day trip it would have been a bit too involved. Enter Tulikartta.fi which facilitates finding a shelter a lot!</p>

<h2 id="an-introduction-to-tulikarttafi">An introduction to Tulikartta.fi</h2>

<p>A couple of weeks ago I read a tweet with a link to <a href="http://www.tulikartta.fi/">Tulikartta.fi</a> and I was immediately intrigued. A map of fire? Click, and I was there.</p>

<iframe src="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16985487862/player/" width="1024" height="626" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" oallowfullscreen="" msallowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>It didn’t take me more than a look and a bit of reading to figure out what I had in front of me: A superb tool to plan overnighters and backpacking trips in Finland where I don’t want to carry a <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/shelters/">shelter</a> or might, for extra comfort and because I love a nice fire, camp close to a hut, fireplace or laavu. I set out to experiment a bit with it and see what kind of outdoors infrastructure the map listed around Vaasa, my home town. </p>

<iframe src="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16364468064/player/" width="1024" height="640" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" oallowfullscreen="" msallowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Plenty of options to take the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/11/pelago-bicycles-stavanger.html">bike</a> and head to one of these places, make a fire and sleep outside. I also saw that a few fire places, bird towers and laavus were missing on the map, but happily the people who developed Tulikartta also thought of that and you can add a listing yourself. </p>

<iframe src="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16985487622/player/" width="1024" height="628" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" oallowfullscreen="" msallowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>I need to say it is one of these services where you might think “Why has no-one thought of this before?”. I like it alot already and it has given me plenty ideas for adventures close to home in-between the bigger trips this year. Using the existing infrastructure allows me to go ultralight with the bike and leave a shelter and <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/stoves/">stove</a> at home and make use of a nice Lavvu by a lake and grill a bread and sausage over a fire. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16366741123" title="Laavus in Finland by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7647/16366741123_af56d6f95c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="628" alt="Laavus in Finland" /></a></p>

<p>Right now the service is only in Finnish but it should be easy enough to use also if you don’t speak this beautiful &amp; easy language. To get you started: Laavu = an open shelter, Autiotupa = a open, free-to-use Wilderness Hut, a Kota = a native Saami tent, similar to a tipi from wood, Päivätupa = A Day Trip Hut and Nuotiopaikka = a Fireplace. The shelters usually also have a fireplace and a dry toilet close by to them, too, along with a woodshed and the obligatory saw and axe. Now that you know where to find the next shelter &amp; fireplace head out and enjoy the Finnish nature!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16801327849" title="Fireplace by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7634/16801327849_43d2aa66b2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Fireplace" /></a></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>“There is no bad weather, only bad clothes.”</em> </p>

<p>That’s a popular saying here in the North, and it is easy to imagine that this saying drives <a href="http://arcteryx.com/">Arc’teryx</a> Designer Greg Grenzke and his team forward to design the best possible apparel for their <a href="http://arcteryx.com/ProductFind.aspx?language=EN&amp;Collection=Ascent">Ascent Line</a>. What goes into designing garments that are lightweight, functional and durable enough to survive in the mountains but are timeless in appearance you can read in this <em>Mountain People interview</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Hi Greg, thank you for taking the time for answering my questions.  Could you please introduce yourself briefly so we have an idea  what’s  your background?</strong></p>

<p>I studied industrial design at the University of Cincinnati as part of the DAAP (Design, Architecture, Art, and Planning program). Part of this program is cooperative education where they require the students to rotate between school and internships every 3 months year round for the last 4 years of the 5 year program. I did various internships throughout school such as with companies like Salomon Sports, Specialized Bicycles, and design firms. Anytime I had the opportunity to select the type of product I could work on it was always outdoor/ sports related, pretty much to the point my classmates would make fun of me because that was always my focus. This really helped me get my foot into the sports industry as I started building a portfolio of concepts/ products that I was really passionate about. I was offered a job before I graduated University from Specialized Bicycles. I worked there for 8 years designing all sorts of products such as footwear, bikes, bike graphics, helmets, saddles, gloves, really a huge variety of different products utilizing both hard goods and soft goods. The design approach was very hands on at Specialized which is also how things work at <a href="http://arcteryx.com">Arc’teryx</a>. I have been at Arc’teryx now for over 3,5 years where I am the Designer/ Design Manager of the Ascent Apparel category. It’s been a fun challenge resolving soft good problems with more of an industrial design approach and methodology.</p>

<p>I have been active outdoors for as long as I can remember growing up in Michigan. Once I could drive (age 16 back then) that was really my door to freedom. I would borrow my mom’s car and go on road trips with friends to bike, hike, climb, ski, any opportunity I could typically heading west to the mountains.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16898393366" title="Greg bootpackin' by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr'"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8694/16898393366_a4e282d544_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="gg bootpackin" /></a>

<p><strong>As a Category Manager for the Ascent line I imagine you’re a mountaineer and climber yourself. What are some of your favourite  routes and places?</strong></p>

<p>I still feel like I’m on vacation living in Coastal Mountain Range in North Vancouver as it’s somewhere I would come for vacation if I didn’t live here. You know you live in a pretty incredible place when you are traveling to other naturally beautiful countries and you still just want to get back home.</p>

<p>Some of my favorite places are very local like the Tantalus Mountain Range for alpine climbing which is about a 45 minute drive near Squamish BC, Canmore Alberta where I just went for my first time ice climbing with some of our athletes, and <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2015/03/learn-mountaineering-at-the-2015-arcteryx-alpine-academy.html">Chamonix</a> where there are endless options! One of my other passions is ski touring/ mountaineering where again BC continues to stun me with its vast space and mountains where you often don’t encounter another soul sometimes for days at end.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16301931724" title="Greg and Tanja Schmitt, photo credit Matthias Scherer"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7627/16301931724_253140ddc9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Greg and Tanja Schmitt, photo credit Matthias Scherer_Austria" /></a></p>

<p><strong>We met at the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/07/arcteryx-alpine-academy-2014.html">Arc’teryx Alpine Academy 2014</a> at the “Insulation  types  for alpine environments” Seminar, where you introduced us with your  colleague Jon to the synthetic &amp; down insulation garments from  Arc’teryx. Some of these garments just came out - but can you give  us  a brief glimpse at what we could expect in the next season from  Arc’teryx?</strong></p>

<p>Well, let’s just say you can expect to see more insulation from us building upon our current offerings. There is a lot happening in the insulation world with new technologies and manufacturing processes. We are pretty conservative until we can prove the technology is substantially better than what we currently use and that it can stand the test of time. However, we are always experimenting with new ideas and technologies.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14784519783" title="Heatgun by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3847/14784519783_f6aee8fa98_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Heatgun" /></a></p>

<p><strong>The Arc’teryx down insulation line has been available since 2013,  has it been more popular than your synthetics line?</strong></p>

<p>I’m not a sales guy so I’m definitely not the one to ask about sales numbers. However, the down line was a huge success after the 2013 launch and it is really growing extremely fast.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16304283443" title="Design Room"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8702/16304283443_9a7406a0f8_b.jpg" width="864" height="576" alt="S15 Craftsmanship_DesignRoom_Dec13-45" /></a></p>

<p><strong>What’s your own favourite layering setup when you head out into  the  mountains for a day of mountaineering or climbing?</strong></p>

<p>This really depends on where I am, weather conditions, how long I plan on being out, etc. But if I were to take a versatile system that works in many different situations I prefer to use something like a <a href="http://arcteryx.com/product.aspx?language=EN&amp;gender=mens&amp;model=Solo-Hoody">Solo Hoody</a> using our very hydrophobic Thermatek insulation as a belay/insulation layer, an <a href="http://arcteryx.com/product.aspx?language=EN&amp;gender=mens&amp;model=Alpha-FL-Jacket">Alpha FL shell</a> as it is very light weight, durable, and very breathable utilizing Gore-Tex Pro, a mid layer with high air permeability that provides light insulation but can dump heat/ moisture when you are pushing hard, and a slight synthetic base layer.   </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16923318411" title="Greg in Canmore"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8740/16923318411_1906e7e4ef_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="greg_canmore" /></a>
©Jon Rockefeller</p>

<p><strong>How long do you on average work on designing a garment? Is it a  couple of weeks from idea to prototype to fabrication sample, or  can  many months or even years go by?</strong></p>

<p>This also depends on if the product is a new style or a redesign of an existing style. Sometimes all the answers are in your head and the design time could be very quick. Other times, yes it can take months or even years to validate a design and it may not even make it to the market.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16923316131" title="Craftsmanship in the Arc'teryx Design Room"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8754/16923316131_2288edaba7_b.jpg" width="864" height="576" alt="S15 Craftsmanship_DesignRoom_Dec13-90" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Can you walk us through the different steps that go into making e.g. a Alpine climbing jacket like the Alpha FL?</strong></p>

<p>The first step is always defining the users need for a product. The Alpha FL is for travelling light &amp; fast while trying not to sacrifice durability. We had a really good starting point with the previous Alpha FL but we knew we could improve the product by minimizing seams, seam tape width, unnecessary glue/ fabric, and using a more durable face fabric with the Gore-Tex Pro membrane. We had various prototypes we tested in the field as well as in a lab for breathability testing. We ended up with a much more durable product at almost the same weight, about 69% less surface area from seam tape, more breathable, and more ergonomic feature set.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16301928864" title="Design tools"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8743/16301928864_22360c83f6_b.jpg" width="864" height="576" alt="S15 Craftsmanship_DesignRoom_Dec13-63" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Are you &amp; your colleagues inspired by ideas from other companies  that make alpine climbing lines, or do you try to work in a vacuum  and  insulate yourself from what the others are doing?</strong></p>

<p>Ha, well North Vancouver can be a bit of a vacuum. We have a pretty unique work atmosphere and designers often challenge each other to make better products. Just walking around seeing what others are working on can be very inspiring and that’s where a lot of ideas stem from. We like to look forward and think about what could be done and not what has been done.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16304283403" title="2014-Northwoods-HO by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8752/16304283403_723db53bf1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="2014-Northwoods-HO" /></a></p>

<p>  <strong>What role do your athletes have in the design process? Are they  involved from the start or does their feedback first come in when  they  are using what you have designed?</strong></p>

<p>We have some pretty amazing athletes in that they are so down to earth and easy to work with. They are some of the best testers we have as they literally live in the product. If their needs aren’t being met they will let us know and we will work with them to fill that need. Sometimes they will have ideas and we will make some prototypes for them to test. We do typically try to involve them early in the design process. We spend as much time with our athletes as we can, especially in the field as it’s a good excuse to get out of the office. Many of them are more like friends, as we share the same passions.    </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14731353344" title="Self-arrest by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2896/14731353344_f604fca9f0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Self-arrest" /></a></p>

<p><strong>What are the three most important attributes when you’re setting  out  designing a garment?</strong></p>

<p>Designing for longevity is typically one of the most important attributes that is always on our mind. This is really in the dna of the brand and it’s always rewarding to hear the stories of how someone’s jacket has lasted them over a decade, you can just see their face light up when they are telling you about it. </p>

<p>Another element of designing for longevity is building in timelessness. The brand has a very strong design language and we continue to build off this strong foundation. Although the materials and constructions continue to improve we want a product we design today to still look modern in 5 or 10 years. If you look at the lineage of something like the Beta AR or SV jacket, you can look at one from ten years ago and see the commonality. When we build in this timelessness we are also building in value.  </p>

<p><strong>Arc’teryx is well known for not resting on its laurels and  pushing  the boundaries. You’ve developed better water-resistant zippers,  were  one of the first companies to laminate seams, minimizing cuts so  that  seams are at an absolute minimum and many other innovations. Can we  expect another such innovation breakthrough from Arc’teryx in the  next  years?</strong></p>

<p>Arc’teryx always strives to push the boundaries and challenge conventional thinking. We still have some of the genius minds that helped create what the brand is today, as well as many new additions. We are definitely working on various future concepts but first we need to validate that they are feasible.</p>

<p><strong>Greg, thank you for taking the time for answering my questions!</strong></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://arcteryxacademy.com/">2015 Arc’teryx Alpine Academy</a> starts in less than three months, and enrolment for clinics starts today! So don’t ponder longer and sign up for one of the best Mountaineering Events of the year and come to Chamonix in June!</p>

<p><a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2015/03/learn-mountaineering-at-the-2015-arcteryx-alpine-academy.html" title="ARCTERYX_ACADEMY_PiotrD_928A1578 by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8611/16650270818_3c404c9f35_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="ARCTERYX_ACADEMY_PiotrD_928A1578" /></a></p>

<p>I wrote in detail about the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/07/arcteryx-alpine-academy-2014.html">2014 Arc’teryx Alpine Academy</a> and just booked my flights for this year’s event. If you want to learn about mountaineering, alpine climbing and the skills needed to safely cross a glacier on a hike, then you should right now surf to the <a href="http://arcteryxacademy.com">Arc’teryx Alpine Academy website</a> as registration for the clinics opens today. Here’s the teaser to get you in the mood:</p>

<iframe width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ERdkz2ga_6s" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>As in 2014 the ‘Compagnie des Guides de Chamonix’, the ‘British Mountain Guides’ (BMG) and the Chamex Guides together with Arc’teryx Athletes like Ines Papert, Luka Lindic, Nina Caprez and Mina Leslie-Wujastyk will teach you the skills and know-how to enjoy the mountains. New this year is the Clean-Up-Day on Thursday, the 11th of June, where the athletes and participants clean the mountains from rubbish. I’ll be there for that occasion, and can highly recommend you are too so you can get acclimatized before you head up to the Aiguille du Midi =) </p>

<p>You can read about the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/07/arcteryx-alpine-academy-2014.html">logistics of getting and staying there</a> in my article from last year, and check out the <a href="http://arcteryxacademy.com/shop/">2015 Clinics</a> now so you know what to book. I have no doubt that the most popular courses will be fully-booked in a matter of minutes, so act quickly! New courses this year are <a href="http://arcteryxacademy.com/product/clinic-06-sun-advanced-technical-alpinism/">Advanced Technical Alpinism</a>, <a href="http://arcteryxacademy.com/product/clinic-11-sun-traditional-climbing/">Traditional Climbing</a>, <a href="http://arcteryxacademy.com/product/clinic-19-sun-big-wall-climbing/">Big Wall Climbing</a> and <a href="http://arcteryxacademy.com/product/clinic-20-sat-ski-alpinism/">Ski Alpinism</a> and there’s again exclusive Women’s courses, too. And make sure to join the <a href="http://arcteryxacademy.com/product/ad-mountain-dinner/">Academy Dinner</a> on Saturday evening before the <a href="http://arcteryxacademy.com/movie-night/">Movie Night</a>. It’s going to be a superb event and I am super psyched to be going there again this year, and if will be there - be sure to <a href="https://twitter.com/hendrikmorkel">let</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hikinginfinland">me</a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/1/b/105082905705272949032/105082905705272949032/posts">know</a> so we can have a chat! </p>

<p>See you in Chamonix in June!</p>

Vivid are the memories of driving through them as a child with mom and dad on the way to Southern Italy and back to Germany, then a <a href="http://www.rockandice.com">Rock &amp; Ice article</a> a few years ago re-kindled that love to go and visit one of the most beautiful areas in Italy. Sure, there would be some sweet hiking and cycling there, but it will still be there at another time. Now, this trip, it will be about climbing Multi-Pitch Routes and do Via Ferratas, visit a <a href="http://www.messner-mountain-museum.it">Messner Mountain Museum</a> and enjoy the good life with a great mate.</p>

<p>And with the <a href="http://www.rockfax.com/climbing-guides/books/the-dolomites-rock-climbs-and-via-ferrata/">The Dolomites: Rock Climbs &amp; Via Ferrata</a> Guide Book the good life already starts at home with the planning. I have been since a few weeks each evening going through the Guide Book and found it a superb resource to plan our trip. It’s so easy to send a short message á la <em>“Check out that sweet Multi-Pitch climb on page 384! Wanna do that?”</em> and literally be on the same page. It makes deciding on climbs a lot faster and easier, too, because opening a page in a book is faster &amp; more convenient than surfing to a webpage.</p>

<p>So how is this book lay out? Well, it starts with a bit of (climbing) history of the region and its geology, gives tips on other books and maps, and then tells you all you need to know about the Logistics of getting there, getting around, where to eat, sleep and what to bring. Then there’s a chapter each on Via Ferratas and Climbing, with explanations of grades, gear and how to plan a trip on the routes. Very useful and open pretty much all the time is the overview map of the Region (page 26/ 27 ;) before the book goes into the details.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16800637951" title="The Dolomites Rock Climbs &amp; Via Ferrata by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7620/16800637951_e9fa1116c3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="The Dolomites Rock Climbs &amp; Via Ferrata" /></a></p>

<p>And details means in this case detailed maps of the Region/ sector, photos with drawn-in topos and in-depth descriptions of the Via Ferratas and climbs. I found these descriptions very good, they give a bit of extra information on how hard the climb could be and how long it could take. What I like best about the <a href="http://www.rockfax.com">Rockfax.com</a> Guide Book is that you can download either the sectors/ climbs or the whole book onto your smartphone, allowing you to leave the 926 g Guide Book at home and don’t need to carry it up a climb - smart stuff. At the end there’s a Route Index and another map of the region with a General Index. </p>

<p>So, for me this has been a wonderful Guide Book thus far. The photos are top-notch and have me very much looking forward to this trip. What could be improved would be probably a larger fold-out/ take-out map as I feel I’m checking it all the time - we’re not staying in one Region/ Sector but plan to see a lot, though if you have more time and/ or stay in one Region you’ll probably be happy as it is. Overall I’d say you should get this Guide Book if you plan to visit the Dolomites for climbing and Via Ferrata hiking - or you should get it if you want to have a very good reason to visit them =) It’s a beautiful book with inspiring photos, all the information we needed to plan the trip logistics and it has in-depth information on the climbs and Via Ferratas of the region. It has been a source of joy for me in the last weeks and has me very much looking forward to visit this Region again - lets hope the weather will be kind for climbing!</p>

<p>Buy the book directly from <a href="http://www.rockfax.com/climbing-guides/books/the-dolomites-rock-climbs-and-via-ferrata/">Rockfax.com</a>, at your local climbing or book shop or order it from your favourite taste of <a href="http://amzn.to/1x0WARt">Amazon.com</a>, <a href="http://amzn.to/1GMfr5H">Amazon.co.uk</a> or <a href="http://amzn.to/1GMfYVk">Amazon.de</a>.</p>

<h2 id="petzl">Petzl</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16578475520" title="Petzl Sitta harness by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8731/16578475520_e272aca434_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Petzl Sitta harness" /></a></p>

<p>There were four big news for me at <a href="http://www.petzl.com/">Petzl</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The new Sitta Harness</li>
  <li>The new RAD System</li>
  <li>The new positioning lanyards</li>
  <li>The updated headlamp line-up</li>
</ul>

<p>Lets look at these in detail.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16578288858" title="Petzl Sitta harness by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7609/16578288858_3e832e66ca_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Petzl Sitta harness" /></a></p>

<p>The new harness obviously immediately had my interest, as it’s lighter yet again as the Hirundos (that I have here and which is already damn light at 280 g in Size Medium) - the Sitta will be 250 g in Size Medium and a sweet 230 g in Size Small. The Wireframe Technology which this harness uses uses Dyneema strands in the waistbelt and leg loops and which replaces webbing and foam in normal harnesses. It’s a very compact harness with a beautiful design that’s slim but still packs all you need from a harness: Two rigid front gear loops, two flexible back gear loops, two Caritool slots and a rear loop for a haul rope. It’s made of Bluesign® approved fabrics, too. Psyched about this one!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16764794052" title="Petzl RAD System by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8718/16764794052_1aa2dcaae5_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Petzl RAD System" /></a></p>

<p>The new RAD System, (<strong>R</strong>escue <strong>A</strong>nd <strong>D</strong>escent) is an all-in-one set for skiers that allows you to set up an crevasse rescue, rappel or rope up on a glacier. The set contains three Attache carabiners, one storage bag, one Tibloc, one Micro Traxion, one 120 cm sling and the 30 m RAD Line, a newly developed 6 mm cordage which allows you to do a crevasse rescue, rope up on a glacier or rappel. The whole set weighs in at 1.045 g which is quite a bit lighter as other options, and also very compact. The cord tips the scales at 660 g for the 30 m, that’s 22 g/ m. It’s a static cord with less than 2% stretch which makes it great for rappels and rescue actions and minimizes yo-yo effects. It’s something any backcountry skier usually will carry, though nothing yet packs down as compact and light as the RAD (4 l pack size!).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16143568884" title="Petzl Positioning Lanyards by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8580/16143568884_0dd68a1709_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Petzl Positioning Lanyards" /></a></p>

<p>The Positioning lanyards are interesting. They aim to replace your Daisychain/ 120 cm sling with which you clip into the belay station. The Connect Adjust is made for sports climbing and mountaineering, while the Dual Connect Adjust is for Multi-Pitch routes and mountaineering. You attach them with a girth hitch to your tie-in point and then clip them out of the way until you need them. The magic happens when you arrive at the belay. With the locking carabiner (not included in the sets) you clip in to the belay, and then can easily adjust the length of the lanyard with the Adjust ascender. The lanyard is a dynamic rope which can reduce the force in case of a short fall. The Connect Adjust tips the scales at 125 g and the Dual Connect Adjust at 160 g, and will need one or two locking carabiners respectively. Knowing how much discussions we have in our climbing club about slings/ daisy chains/ <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/metolius-personal-anchor-system-black/?pid=81">Personal Anchor Systems</a> I reckon these will be hotly discussed, too. Personally I think they are great ideas which can make adjusting the length at the belay a lot easier and possibly safer, though they’re a tad heavier than normal systems (which in turn are a lot heavier than just tying in with a Clove hitch).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16578285888" title="Petzl Headlamps by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7593/16578285888_8def09b8d4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Petzl Headlamps" /></a></p>

<p>The headlamps line got a refresh, and many models got more power (= Lumen) and there’s also a hole bunch of new, fresh colours. The Tikkina, Tikka and Zipka headlamps went up to 80, 100 and 100 Luen respectively, the Tikka + and the Tikka XP went to 160 and 180 Lumen and the Tactikka + and Tactikka +RGB are headlamps in more toned down colours (all black, desert and camo) are for hunters and fishermen. Both come with 160 Lumen output and have different light options which allow for stealth and keeping your night vision.</p>

<h2 id="scarpa">Scarpa</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16765869135" title="Scarpa by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8568/16765869135_77370356c4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Scarpa" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://scarpa.it">Scarpa</a> goes wild with the Mojito Wild. The upper is made of spotted or plain color “cavallino” leather and the sole is the Spider Trek sole in all black. They’re probably going to be wildly popular, as I imagine the Mojito Patchwork will be, where every shoe will be totally unique as they are hand-sewed, with each square being different thus making every upper completely unique. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16578271698" title="Scarpa Alien 2.0 by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7632/16578271698_070961ef9a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Scarpa Alien 2.0" /></a></p>

<p>On the other hand you have the Alien 2.0. It is a race boot that employs the Tronic technology – a ski/ walk mechanism that automatically blocks the cuff to the shell simply by inserting the boot into the binding which should give you an advantage during a race when every second counts. It has an internal gaiter and a full carbon shell and cuff and it is closed with the Alien Fast Buckle Closure and the Boa Closure System. </p>

<h2 id="the-omm">The OMM</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16143535204" title="The OMM Mountain Raid Jacket &amp; PA 1.0 Sleep System by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8646/16143535204_c40b372fa7_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="The OMM Mountain Raid Jacket &amp; PA 1.0 Sleep System" /></a></p>

<p>I really like to stop by at the guys from <a href="https://theomm.com">The OMM</a> as there is always cool gear to be seen. Take the Mountain Raid Jacket &amp; PA 1.0 Sleep System above. Both garments are filled with Primaloft Gold and weigh 390 g for the Jacket and 235 g for the half-bag. The Half bag connects via push buttons on the inside of the jacket to it to create one versatile sleeping system that weighs in at 625 g. The half-bag also has a draw string to pull it tighter and packs a mighty fine 16 x 11 cm when its in your pack. This will be a hot item for runners and (S)UL Backpackers alike I think, it’s a great execution of the <em>“Multi-use”</em> idea.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16739960016" title="The OMM Rotor Vest by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7637/16739960016_563fa0f204_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="The OMM Rotor Vest" /></a></p>

<p>The Rotor Vest tips the scales at 135 g and is filled with Primaloft Gold in a 40 g weight variation. It packs rather small as I show above when you don’t need it, but when you put it on you’ll be toasty. It has a zipper so you can dump heat, a hem drawstring and the chest pocket also functions as the stuff sack. The Purple colour above also looks superb!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16764773562" title="The OMM Kamleika Race Smock II by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7621/16764773562_ee7d0c4cd9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="The OMM Kamleika Race Smock II" /></a></p>

<p>The Kamleika Race Smock II above isn’t new but the colour combo is and I’m totally in love with it. </p>

<h2 id="extreme-food">Extreme Food</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16765859435" title="Extreme Food Booth by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7599/16765859435_dae4ba6952_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Extreme Food Booth" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.extreme-food.eu">Extreme Food</a> had one of the most fun booths on the show. It was simple, but the juxtaposition of fine porcelain, sterling cutlery and wine glasses with a fine course of freeze dried food in a bag was just great. The food is made in the UK from high quality natural ingredients with no artificial colourings or preservatives, and I have seen some UK tweeps already tasting it and finding it delicious. And what’s pretty awesome about these meals is that breakfasts, mains and desserts all have a superb weight-to-calorie ratio: A minimum of 4.8 kcal per g! That means each pouch weighs 102 g and gives you 500 kcal, which is pretty lightweight. Best of all, they’re <a href="http://www.extreme-food.eu/stockists.html">available already</a>!</p>

<h2 id="salomon">Salomon</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16076604673" title="Salomon by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8673/16076604673_f38509f1e7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Salomon" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.salomon.com/">Salomon</a> had so much new stuff on the show that it’s hard to narrow it down. Lets start with the shoes, shoes at Salomon are always worth checking out, because they’re damn good.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16510388979" title="Salomon X Alp GTX M Approach Shoe by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8640/16510388979_1e088bcaa5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Salomon X Alp GTX M Approach Shoe" /></a></p>

<p>The X Alp GTX M Approach Shoe is the small sibling of the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/07/outdoor-news-2014-day-4.html">Salomon S-Lab Alp Carbon GTX</a>, the mountaineering boot I already found awesome at the OutDoor 2014. It also employs a carbon midsole that is laterally stable but otherwise flexible, so should be great on these Approach shoes. They should arrive for test this week, so keep an eye on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hikinginfinland">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hendrikmorkel">Twitter</a> for some tidbits on them.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16076575143" title="Salomon by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8664/16076575143_c4dd257abc_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Salomon" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16074215914" title="Salomon by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8626/16074215914_94ffd2974a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Salomon" /></a></p>

<p>The Salomon S-Lab gear is probably some of the most advanced kit on the market and Kilian Jornet’s thoughts and feedback go into it. The S-Lab Wings above is a universal shoe for your trail runs that excels on the way down. This gives you more protection on the downhill and has a great fit in the heel thanks to the combination of Descent Control and the SensiFit-System, so that your foot doesn’t move to the front or sides.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16509153630" title="Salomon by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8665/16509153630_8f0df0d707_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Salomon" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16510408099" title="Salomon by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8623/16510408099_88b6153059_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Salomon" /></a></p>

<p>Shoes for less serious trailrunning were abound, too. The Speedcross Vario is the shoe for harder trails in dry weather, while the Speedcross Pro is great on wet and soft terrain (= MUD!). They’re built on the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/04/salomon-speedcross-3.html">Speedcross 3</a> model with different soles and thus if you love the Speedcross 3 but need a shoe that’s better in soft and moist terrain, grab the Pro, or if you run usually in dry, desert-like terrain on hard trails the Vario will be for you. Why? Well, the Vario’s profile is larger and hence gives more friction on the ground, and there’s also more cushioning. The Pro on the other hand has the Mud &amp; Snow Contragrip sole, with smaller and more aggressive cleats. In the Pro your foot sits deeper in the shoe for a better ground feeling, too.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16510422379" title="Salomon by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8648/16510422379_2fff5b2640_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Salomon" /></a></p>

<p>The Carbon Ski enthusiast will be delighted by this combo. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16696559455" title="Salomon Skitracer by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8620/16696559455_15231a99b1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Salomon Skitracer" /></a></p>

<p>And the Freerider/ Powder enthusiast might consider a Skitracer the next time he drops into 3 meters of fresh pow and loses a ski. Because with the skitracer he’s able to find the ski again when it has hidden in that sweet powder.</p>

<h2 id="klttermusen">Klättermusen</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16558580277" title="Klättermusen by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8641/16558580277_eba0b13136_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Klättermusen" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://klattermusen.se/">Klättermusen</a> now entered the leguminous plants business. I think that’s rather smart, beans are after all super tasty and if you can make shell material out of them instead of oil - hey, that might mean some idiot oil company might not need to go and ruin the Arctic for us and the polar bears! The Nylon in their new insulation garments is made of Castor Seeds, which Toray and Klättermusen have developed together. At the moment the Nylon is made out of 60% plant-based raw materials but both companies work hard to bring this up to 100%. The plant-based nylon is supposed to have the same qualities as crude oil nylon, and at least trying them one and checking them out I wasn’t able to tell a difference, which is positive. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16695481312" title="Klättermusen Castor Seeds Nylon by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8595/16695481312_0f6ac6ec97_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Klättermusen Castor Seeds Nylon" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16695203101" title="Klättermusen Bore 2.0 Jacket by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8583/16695203101_27fc10abf2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Klättermusen Bore 2.0 Jacket" /></a></p>

<p>The Bore 2.0 Jacket that Malin models above packs 300 g of 800+ cuin goose down and Primaloft Silver ECO in the shoulders and back of the arms. Its shell is made from the new “Bean Nylon” and has a PFOA-free DWR finish on it, is made in a box wall construction and to minimize seams and cold spots the pockets have been moved in line with the side seams. It’s a super-toasty jacket that has a very nice cut, though the price tag of 500€ is pretty steep. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16509118970" title="Klättermusen Frö 2.0 Vest by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8577/16509118970_cfb512ab41_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Klättermusen Frö 2.0 Vest" /></a></p>

<p>The Frö 2.0 Vest is a midlayer piece for winter use with an Primaloft Silver Active insulation. At 250€ it’s more affordable than the Bore 2.0 Jacket but of course not nearly as warm! The high collar keeps chilly winds from your neck and throat, you can adjust the arm openings to be closed for keeping the warmth inside or open them for a bit of ventilation. The asymmetric zipper is perfect (all zippers should be asymmetric at the top in my opinion) and if you’re not a Vest-kind-guy-or-gal then you also can get the Frö 2.0 as a jacket. </p>

<h2 id="onoo">onoo</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16764802102" title="onoo Jackets by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7626/16764802102_60c5935639_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="onoo Jackets" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://onoo.de">onoo</a> is a young start-up from Munich which gathers to the urban cyclists. It was a bit of luck that I met them and I did like what they had to show. The three jackets all have a cycling specific fit and are from materials that are not worried if rain, dirt and abuse is coming its way. I had fun trying them on and speaking with the founder, and do agree with what he said: People know which jacket will suit them. I tried that one above on first and really like how it looks and feels, and while <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16558587877/">this one</a> is pretty swell as well it’s maybe a tad less my style?! <a href="http://onoo.de/collection/">Check their collection</a> and pick the jacket which suits yours!</p>

<h2 id="vibram">Vibram</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16695377681" title="Vibram Megagrip by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8681/16695377681_42a821081c_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Vibram Megagrip" /></a><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16510345879" title="Vibram Megagrip by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8600/16510345879_0724a351fc_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Vibram Megagrip" /></a></p>

<p>Getting a meeting at <a href="http://vibram.com">Vibram</a> has been on my agenda for a looooong time, so I was happy that after three years of trying I finally was deemed worthy. The big news at Vibram was their Megagrip sole, which has apparently pretty awesome grip on wet granite. At least they had a nice test parcours built up where you could try that out, but as I was already running around for six hours on the fair I was a bit shy in sharing my sweaty feet smell with others and so kept my shoes on. I’m sure some Megagrip shoe will appear at HiF HQ some day in the future, though, and as we have lots of granite in Finland and also no shortage of rain I will see if it performs as claimed =) If you too want to have Megagrip, you’re in luck: A whole bunch of shoe companies, from Scarpa to Salewa &amp; Arc’teryx, have used the soles in their 2015 shoes which are just hitting the stores, so go and get a pair!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.vaude.com">Vaude</a> is the “small” Family business which still turns out a lot of new gear. Not everything is ultralight though what Vaude really knows is environmentally friendly production. Lots of good stuff they are doing, and either I’m getting older or they’re getting younger in their styles because I did like quite a few pieces from them. The Alphapro Bib Pants above are Winter Cycling insulation Pants with Polartec® Alpha insulation in them and an Vaude Eco Finish DWR. Mesh suspenders keep the bib in place and a Men’s Advanced Cycling seat cushion ensures you can sit long in the saddle. It will weigh around 440 g and is an ISPO Award winner.</p>

<p>The Primasoft Jacket is a ISPO Gold Award winner and another cycling jacket. It combines Primaloft insulation materials with softshell materials in 3 different zones and is aimed at mountain bikers who like to ride in winter (Wait, aren’t they called Fatbikers?!). It has Primaloft Silver in the front and back, breathable inserts under the arms and in the back, a softshell material with a membrane in the front and kidney area and reflective details so you’re seen between dusk &amp; dawn and tips the scales at 485 g. </p>

<p><a href="https://hestragloves.com">Hestra Gloves</a> make awesome gloves. The Moon Mitt above has a Primaloft insulation, a lambskin palm so you can pick up the kettle and has a liner, too. Toasty hands guaranteed.</p>

<p>New too is their vegetable tanned leather. It has been tanned using natural tannins such as bark powder. The method produces a supple leather with a unique brown colour and is the oldest known way of tanning. As the Press Release reads, <em>“The look and feel of a vegetable tanned leather is hard to beat and it ages naturally in a beautiful way.”</em> and yes, I agree. These vegetable tanned gloves were pretty, and the Abisko and Helags Junior Mitt above were very sweet indeed. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16764783932" title="Madshus IntelliGrip Skin by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8610/16764783932_451518694e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Madshus IntelliGrip Skin" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://madshus.com">Madshus</a> has been making the IntelliGrip Skins, a special climbing skin for XC skis, since five years. Other than the full-length skins for alpine touring skis, IntelliGrip has the climbing skin only in the grip zone of the ski – just like wax or klister. The entire front part is made from polyethylene, the same material as the base itself, and since it worked so well, Madshus now integrates IntelliGrip into the base of skis. The first model is the Terrasonic IntelliGrip Classic, a ski made for ambitious cross-country skiers eager to take advantage of a high performance waxing ski but who want to avoid the disadvantages of a conventional NoWax-ski. It
never requires the application of grip wax and avoids the typical disadvantages of NoWax-skis: the glide is much better than on any kind of fish-scale patterns and there is no rattling noise in an icy track.</p>

<p>More interesting for the ski-touring/ backcountry cross-country skiing enthusiast, the Backcountry skis from Madshus got a face-lift and now looks freshers as <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2011/01/backcountry-cross-country-skiing.html">my old ones</a>. Also the Glittertind BC Boot got a small update as the cuff is now a lot higher and is made of MemBrain® softshell material, which I think is a good development. </p>

<h2 id="millet">Millet</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16765840625" title="Millet by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7650/16765840625_8e13df02a9_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Millet" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.millet.fr/en/">Millet</a> showcased their Triology Series, which is made for alpine pursuits in winter: Ice climbing, mountaineering, winter ascents, mixed climbing. Inspiration for the line comes from the winter ascents of the Eiger, Matterhorn and Grandes Jorasses North Faces of Eric Escoffiers in 1987. The garments are made of the most modern materials available and the “ingredients list” reads like a who-is-who: Polartec® Power Wool™, Polartec® Thermal Pro® Highloft, Tecnowool®, Gore-Tex® Pro, Gore-Tex® Helios Stretch, PrimaLoft®, Windstopper®, Schoeller® Wool Naturetec and K DRY™ - you see these garments will be made for cold, harsh weather and will keep you toasty and dry. Just climbing you need to yourself!</p>

<p>The Trident Winter Mid from Millet is an ISPO Gold Award winner and a lightweight winter boot for all you winter activities - from snow shoeing to glacier hikes, the Trident does it all and keeps your feet toasty thanks to a Primaloft insulation. It’s waterproof and breathable, too, with a DRYEDGE Membrane, and a Vibram sole to give you grip. It is crampon compatible and should be ideal for snowshoeing. </p>

<p>I think about half of the garment manufacturers I visited had these cuffs where the stretchy rim which keeps the sleeve in place was a few centimetres inside, and not at the end of the sleeve. This does make a lot of sense: It’s easier to put gloves on, or have “free” hands when the gloves are off but at the same time they bring the insulation point further down over the wrist and make the end of the sleeve straighter. The cuffs themselves also should get less dirty and it also might mean warmer wrists as he puffy layer covers them rather nicely. I think it’s a nice development and I’m curious to see if it is better than the traditional cuffs.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.boatechnology.com">Boa Closure System</a> has found its way at this ISPO into a lot of shoes, ski and mountain boots. I tried it on a few shoes and it was indeed very nice to get a good, tight fit and easy to “open” the shoe again. Kamik even used this technology in kid’s boots, which could make it easy for kids to close their shoes on their own. But also trailrunners, hikers, Cross Fitters and Skiers will be able to use the Boa technology, and I reckon it will increase even more in the coming year.</p>

<p>Body Mapping isn’t really anything new, but quite a few companies have made some nice efforts with their garments. It just makes a lot of sense that some garments are windproof in the front and super breathable in the back, with stretchy sides for freedom of movement and warm, toasty hoods. There was, however, still a lack of aymmetric zippers in the face area. Lets hope a designer or two reads this and pleases me with asymmetric zippers in the 2016/ 2017 line-up!</p>

<p>The development of Urban (Outdoor) Styles and collections also is on the rise. As I’m myself am getting more interested in this area you might be able to see some more articles on this topic in the future, but for now: If you’d like to wear a Gore-Tex coat because it pours cats &amp; dogs, there’s a handful of outdoor companies which make those - and many more casual outdoor garments - in urban styles, so you don’t need to wear your bright green hardshell to the next client meeting. This will only be of interest to those who really need to look the part when they go to clients, or those who simply don’t want to wear their “outdoor uniform” in the city. Although, then fellow citizens might not think you’re an <a href="http://www.der-postillon.com/2014/12/mann-mit-jack-wolfskin-jacke.html">Extreme Mountaineer</a>.</p>

<h2 id="ispo-2015-conclusions">ISPO 2015 Conclusions</h2>

<p><em>“Have you seen something new yet?”</em> / <em>“No, pretty much all the same just with a new marketing twist on it”</em></p>

<p>I had close to 40 meetings in three full days, so you get slightly blind to the stuff you’re being presented. Some stuff is really nice, innovative and cool, while other things are just the same old in a new colour. There are these companies who are honest about that fact, while others do as if they re-invent the wheel every year anew. This can get rather tiring if you get to see yet another synthetic/ Merino wool fabric mix that’s supposed to be the best thing yet and hasn’t been done before. Strangely I have been wearing that kind of garments since a while, though they didn’t have the XYZ Logo on it but were from ABC. Ah well, better take another sip of that good Espresso so I have enough processing power for the rest of the meeting(s).</p>

<p>Similar feelings I get with <em>“Our Responsible Down Standard”</em> being flavoured in yet another new name you haven’t heard of before and a totally fascinating story, which, thanks to the coffee you just had, happily doesn’t make you yawn. I’m not working for one company, so I get to see a bit more. I also read (BOOKS! Magazines! Imagine, death trees) and am curious, trying to question some things. So that’s why I don’t make somersaults if presented the best new thing for 2015 since, ähem, yeah, wait, since when exactly?</p>

<p>Four weeks after the ISPO closed it’s gates I’m hard-pressed to tell you what super-duper awesome new gear should be on your must-watch list - but to be honest, already on the fair I had difficulties with that, as the intro sentence maybe showed. Nevertheless, looking back through my <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/sets/72157650454379737/">ISPO photos</a> and re-reading my <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/ispo-2015/">ISPO 2015 posts</a> I can say that yes, there has been some interesting new outdoor gear on the show and my top five would be (in no particular order):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ortovox SAM 3D</li>
  <li>The DPS Tour 1 ski touring skis</li>
  <li>The Arc’teryx gloves that can be layered</li>
  <li>The Petzl Sitta harness</li>
  <li>The OMM “sleep system”</li>
</ul>

<p>Except the first one - the Ortovox SAM 3D - nothing utterly blew my mind, but as I wrote in my post about the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2015/03/ispo-2015-news-3.html">Ortovox</a> news and the SAM 3D, I think this is a superb invention which was - when you see it - so obvious that one can but wonder why something like this hasn’t been thought of before. It’s a very nice executed thing that brings the outdoors indoors and makes your time in the mountains more safe and fun. And that’s what it’s all about, in the end, isn’t it? </p>

<p>And if you liked The ISPO News articles, <a href="http://ko-fi.com/?i=8d16909703c77d0">buy me a cup of coffee or two</a> and then share it with your friends, fans &amp; followers on <a href="http://facebook.com/hikinginfinland">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/hendrikmorkel">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/1/b/105082905705272949032/105082905705272949032/posts">Google+</a>, because <strong>sharing is caring</strong>.</p>

<p><em>Ah ja, wait: I was handed a prototype of a fluffy thing that my ideas and feedback has been going in to since last year and which I have tested sicne I’m back home. That is a pretty neat thing, which definitely should be on your list of “things to watch” if you like fluffy warm things.</em></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A book review of Gaston Rébuffat’s classic “Starlight &amp; Storm” - a <em>Must Read</em> for anyone just remotely interested in going outdoors.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16730495671" title="Gaston Rébuffat: Starlight &amp; Storm by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8629/16730495671_870bcfb3e2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Gaston Rébuffat: Starlight &amp; Storm" /></a></p>

<p>I ordered Starlight &amp; Storm and a bunch of <em>“Classic Mountain Literature”</em> last autumn, probably after getting just another recommendation that it’s a superb book. Getting a book recommended several times sometimes makes me hesistant, but well, I love to read and as the mountains are far away at the moment reading about them is pretty much the next best thing (after browsing <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2015/01/jon-griffith-alpine-exposures.html">photography books</a> of the mountains). Rébuffat’s most well-known book is likely this one or <a href="http://amzn.to/1MbylRU">The Mont Blanc Massif: The Hundred Finest Routes</a>, and I think both books will be found on the bookshelf of a well-read mountaineer, alpinist or hill walker.</p>

<p>The book starts of with a short biography blurb on Rébuffat’s life which is followed by an introduction from Jon Krakauer, which is followed by yet another introduction, a Foreword and then finally you get to read Rébuffat’s words. Puh. Well, the good thing is that the good stuff starts right there with Rébuffat’ story of his ascent of the Grand Jorasses. This and the following chapters, where he descibes his adventures with friends of the great North Faces of the Alps is what really makes this book worth reading. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Everything about the climbing of it was a joy, and as we climbed I seemed to understand the meaning of our exploit. It was not the increasing nearness of the summit,
or the climb in itself, that filled us with a quiet joy, but the feeling that mind and muscles were fulfilling their intended function. Somehow we were “in the right place.”
- Gaston Rébuffat, Starlight &amp; Storm, The North-east Face of Piz Badile</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16111754843" title="Gaston Rébuffat: Starlight &amp; Storm by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8595/16111754843_88fc5b01dc_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Gaston Rébuffat: Starlight &amp; Storm" /></a></p>

<p>I loved the accounts of how he tied up with clients and friends, how they spend nights on these big faces and enjoyed the starlight and peace of the night but welcomed the first rays of sunlight in the morning after a cold bivy, or how they turned around to come back another time because of bad weather. The Brotherhood of the Rope is strong in this book, and you feel that the people Rébuffat was climbing with were more than just climbing partners - they were brothers, sharing a single objective, living together on the rock, between the sky, ice, snow, wind and rain. </p>

<p>The chapters are short enough so that it’s easy to read them before going to bed or commuting to work in a week, and every Mountain chapter is accompanied by a Black-White photo of the mountain in question. What bothered me slightly was that the height and distance measurements where given in illogic feet, but apart from that I loved every part of the book. It’s a fascinating read, not just for alpinists and mountaineers, but also for people who wonder why one would climb a steep, inhospitable rock face. If you can not get to the mountains any time soon, I recommend you pick up this book and dream of having a bivy on one of these Northfaces! Buy the book at your local book shop or order it online from <a href="http://amzn.to/1NoHTMW">Amazon.com</a>, <a href="http://amzn.to/1DRShVx">Amazon.co.uk</a> or <a href="http://amzn.to/18WyyMF">Amazon.de</a>.</p>

<p>I had a lot of fun writing for the second trekking Magazin issue of 2015. It included getting a lot of outdoor garments dirty and then learning about how to make them clean and functional again with the help of a bunch of outdoor detergents. Then I had fun taking photos for my hoody round-up and reviewing six hoodies, which should allow anyone who doesn’t have a hoody yet to find one for his needs! And finally I penned a story about my <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/tatra-mountains/">Polish Tatra</a> trip which you already could read about on these digital pages in the past. As usually that’s not all: My colleagues went out sleeping in <em>Biwakschachteln</em> (bivouac booths) in the Alps, while others went went exploring the Swiss Engadin and hike to an volcano that was erupting. A lot of really inspiring trip reports which certainly will get out in the mood for spring hikes!</p>

<h2 id="rab">Rab</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16076720273" title="Rab by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8569/16076720273_ea53aff4b5_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Rab" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://rab.uk.com">Rab</a> had a bunch of really excellent kit on display. The eye-catcher at the start of the booth was the new Expedition 8000 Suit which comes as a Jacket &amp; Salopettes combination (1.340 g and 850 g respectively) or as a suit (1.990 g). Kit for seriously high peaks or when the next ice age comes, but not for this rubbish winter.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16509074268" title="Rab by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8678/16509074268_1bce8e8408_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Rab" /></a></p>

<p>Kit that is more suitable for this winter is the new Rock/ Lifestyle collection which comes with a mighty fine Rab hoody, cool shirts and nice trousers for climbing and chilling at the crag. Women and men will be equally able to dress up in these garments, which already now are very popular with the Rab athletes. The Headwall Hoody above (539 g) feels great, but I liked even more the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16076700173/">Elevation Pull-On</a> which had a really nice hood design. The Rockover Pant (305 g) could also become popular with hikers, but it’s made for climbing and allows for freedom of movement.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16695361681" title="Rab by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8639/16695361681_19203731d9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Rab" /></a></p>

<p>But lets move on to more technical garments, and there was no shortage of these. A big news was that Rab now uses Fluorocarbon-free Hydrophobic Down in all their down garments, which is good news for those of us who use their down garments in cold &amp; wet environments. I tried on a handful of them and they had the Rab-typical great, alpine fit. Many down-garments also now get a body-mapping construction with using different baffles constructions in different areas, like the Electron Jacket pictured above (470 g) which has a Pertex Endurance shell and has Stitch-through Midi baffles in the torso, back and hood and smaller Stitch-through Mini baffles on the side and arms - if you look closely you can see the different baffle sizes in the photo. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16670728016" title="Rab Paradox Pull-On by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8652/16670728016_2d12aeb551_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Rab Paradox Pull-On" /></a></p>

<p>But it ain’t all down. The Paradox Pull-On uses Polartec® Alpha™ insulation  with a super-stretchy lining and shell. A deep zipper helps with dumping heat on fast ascents or runs, and if you don’t need it the 360 g top packs away small. This was a really nice piece and would be great as a autumn layering piece or on its own on cool days.</p>

<p>There was a bunch more really innovative backpacking/ hillwalking/ climbing/ mountaineering &amp; lifestyle garments to be seen, so you can start saving your $€£ for the coming winter because you’ll want to pick up some of these.</p>

<h2 id="dps-skis">DPS Skis</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16670544676" title="DPS Skis Tour 1 by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8617/16670544676_b52b5f54f1_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="DPS Skis Tour 1" /></a></p>

<p>What I love about these trade fairs is meeting the people who love what they can do with their products. At <a href="http://www.dpsskis.com">DPS Skis</a> I asked my contact which of these he’s riding. <em>“I love the <a href="http://www.dpsskis.com/en/skis/all-mountain-mixed-snow/wailer-99.html">Wailer 99</a> with <a href="http://www.bergzeit.co.uk/dynafit-tlt-radical-st2-anniversary-touring-binding-90mm/?pid=81">Dynafit Radical bindings</a> and a <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/la-sportiva-syborg-tourenskischuhe/">La Sportiva Syborg</a> boot”</em> he told me, and then and there I knew that we’d get along just fine! That’s a pretty awesome and lightweight setup, and best of all: You too could get it! Because unlike other manufacturers DPS Skis sells their brand-new and ISPO Award winning <a href="http://www.dpsskis.com/en/skis.html">Tour 1 Skis</a> already now. So the Tour 1 are lightweight (1.350 g for the 176 cm Wailer 99!) backcountry touring skis which also perform very nicely on the way down the mountain. Because you shouldn’t invest energy in long tours if you can not enjoy the descent!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16076525313" title="DPS Skis Tour 1 by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8661/16076525313_102f653bcf_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="DPS Skis Tour 1" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16509082860" title="DPS Skis Tour 1 by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8678/16509082860_2ee66fff32_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="DPS Skis Tour 1" /></a></p>

<h2 id="patagonia">Patagonia</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16695584932" title="Patagonia by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8650/16695584932_5080e45b2d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Patagonia" /></a></p>

<p>The <a href="http://bit.ly/1vVr6Wj">Patagonia</a> Backcountry Experience collection is divided into five lines: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Lift Access, for quick-strike, done-in-a-day missions</li>
  <li>Free Tour, for more committing powder missions that require traveling a little deeper into the backcountry</li>
  <li>Steeps, for descents extreme enough to require technical climbing skills</li>
  <li>Alpine Touring, for traveling deep and extensively through the snow-covered backcountry</li>
  <li>Approach, for when climbing is the primary objective and skis are necessary tools for access</li>
</ul>

<p>These lines have been developed in cooperation of the Snow and Alpine Teams from Patagonia, and what I saw at the fair looked really swell. Technical fabrics, functional fit and design, all made with the Patagonia-typical environmental thoughts in mind. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16076667093" title="Patagonia by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8588/16076667093_4063b2fdd1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Patagonia" /></a></p>

<p>Another big news is the completely renewed baselayer line-up. The collection is structured into four categories: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Daily, for the stuff you wear each day to the office or grocery shopping by bike in winter</li>
  <li>Lightweight, having the lightest-weight, fastest-drying and best-wicking baselayers</li>
  <li>Midweight, being the most versatile baselayer with the greatest comfort range</li>
  <li>Thermal Weight, the warmest, most breathable baselayer with minimal bulk</li>
</ul>

<p>This is applicable to both the Merino and Capilene® baselayers. Capilene® got an updated fabric that is made from recycled Polyester with better odour control and wicking. The fit has been made the “Slim Fit” across the last three categories (Lightweight, Midweight, Thermal Weight) and everything is recyclable through the Common Threads recycling programme. The baselayers felt soft and nice to the touch, but of course only wearing them one could start to make an opinion on them. The Merino line is made from Patagonian wool and has very nice stripe designs and also felt great. And as you can see above - the whole packaging has been renewed. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16510473569" title="Patagonia Denim by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8658/16510473569_ae4d2de148_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Patagonia Denim" /></a></p>

<p>And then there are Jeans. I haven’t worn a jeans in probably five years but it’s still the de-facto pants for many people. I know that Jeans/ Denim manufacturing is a filthy business, so it’s good to see that Patagonia is setting out to change that. Patagonia® Denim uses 100% organic cotton grown without polluting fertilizers, poisonous pesticides or herbicides. A low-impact dyeing process enables them to dramatically reduce water, energy and chemical use and produce less carbon dioxide. Patagonia also never distress their denim with harsh chemicals or other methods. And the garments are Fair Trade Certified™ for sewing, which makes Patagonia Denim the way denim should be made. Here you can read more about the <a href="http://www.google.fi/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCAQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.iswa.org%2Findex.php%3FeID%3Dtx_iswaknowledgebase_download%26documentUid%3D3184&amp;ei=RW71VPe1D-LXyQOetoDACA&amp;usg=AFQjCNHqwl6f-JkE2wcteEE4OLckX1xvWA&amp;sig2=PCCiF7jMnwRhXQBpOAYj9A&amp;bvm=bv.87269000,d.bGQ">Environmental impact of denim product</a>.</p>

<h2 id="marmot">Marmot</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16489359707" title="Marmot Cerro Torre Jacket, Quasar Hoody &amp; Alpinist Bib by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8631/16489359707_25edc395ba_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Marmot Cerro Torre Jacket, Quasar Hoody &amp; Alpinist Bib" /></a></p>

<p>The Cerro Torre Jacket from <a href="http://marmot.de">Marmot</a> got a full technical revamp and now promises even better performance than its predecessor. Made from the new 3-layer Gore-Tex® C-Knit fabric the jacket is super-light and stays durably waterproof and windproof. The C-Knit gives it a soft feel and an improved breathability rating, which means even better wear comfort. A snug fitting hood, pockets positioned above the level of a backpack waist belt or climbing harness, extra-long Pit-Zips and a two-way front zipper make this a versatile jacket that’s equally well-suited for hiking, trekking, all mountain skiing and freeriding.</p>

<h2 id="lundhags">Lundhags</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16510378169" title="Lundhags Cobbler Boot by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8680/16510378169_b0dc6473cd_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Lundhags Cobbler Boot" /></a></p>

<p>It was my first visit at <a href="http://lundhags.se">Lundhags</a> and it was very nice. I got a pair of their superb <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/lundhags-guide-bc-backcountry-skischuhe/">Guide BC Boots</a> last year for Nordic Touring Skating and skiing and really like them, so it was good to see more of their gear. The big news at the Swedish company was their introduction of casual footwear. I like the look of the Cobbler Boot above, which has a mid height shaft that’s very flexible. I would have liked a more minimalist sole myself, but I reckon the majority of people will like it just as it is - after all, The Beatles wore shoes like this! </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16509112040" title="Lundhags Termik Jacket and Termik W&#x27;s Anorak by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8674/16509112040_77a9bb082c_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Lundhags Termik Jacket and Termik W&#x27;s Anorak" /></a></p>

<p>The Termik Jacket and Termik W’s Anorak above are made of Lundhags Polycotton material that has a parafin wax layer. The material has a 16.000 g/ m2/ 24h breathability rating (minimum) and a 20.000 mm hydrostatic head. The Anorak has a separate inner pocket in the large chest pocket, and a long zipper for easy entry/ exit as well as ventilation. It’s a classic-looking garment made of modern fabrics (well, Polycotton has been around a bit under other names) that surely will find a lot of fans.</p>

<h2 id="ortovox">Ortovox</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16671498646" title="Ortovox SAM 3D by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8598/16671498646_6178105b7a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Ortovox SAM 3D" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://ortovox.com">Ortovox</a> is a company I also really like. Creative &amp; innovative products, great materials and colours, friendly and passionate people - what’s not to like? Take the <a href="http://www.ortovox.com/accessories/e_329113">SAM 3D mountain model</a>: It’s a 3D mountain model for avalanche education that they created after a Mountain Guide contacted them and said <em>“Look, I have an idea”</em>. This model allows you to recognize and interpret topography, understand contour lines, lets you estimate slope steepness and and and. It comes with a map, a set of water-based markers, a handbook and a Clinometer. This is such an awesome and much needed product that one can actually just winder: Why hasn’t anyone thought of this before? That’s what the ISPO also thought and made it a Gold Winner!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16696398812" title="Ortovox Merino Fleece by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8566/16696398812_bcc607ff32_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Ortovox Merino Fleece" /></a></p>

<p>Alright, that’s not all though. The Merino Fleece Plus Jacket on the left use 350 g/ m2 of wool fleece and is mighty warm and looks stylish, too! Then there’s the Merino Ultra Net Hoody on the right above is a finely woven Merino shell and a large-mesh lining this should be bomber warm in really cold weather as it will trap a lot of air next too skin. The hoody will tip the scales at 300 g and because I love hoodies this one is high on my list of <em>“Wanna try!”</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16077491093" title="Ortovox Piz Palü Jacket by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8622/16077491093_50ab54c97a_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Ortovox Piz Palü Jacket" /></a></p>

<p>The Piz Palü Jacket rounds out the layering system from Ortovox and is a super-technical jacket. It uses Pertex Microlight, schoeller naturetec, Swiss Wool and Merino wool to create one athletic touring jacket. It weighs 424 g and has a body-mapping construction which places the mentioned materials there where they make the most sense.</p>

<h2 id="black-diamond">Black Diamond</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16509300620" title="Black Diamond by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8577/16509300620_330b2ab9c5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Black Diamond" /></a></p>

<p>Since <a href="http://eu.blackdiamondequipment.com/en/homepage">Black Diamond</a> entered the apparel market they have been going from strength to strength, refining each season their line and making the garments better and better. This kind of approach is rewarded, and so their Misson Pants with Pieps Pocket won an ISPO Gold Award. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16509299980" title="Black Diamond Viper Ice Tool by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8599/16509299980_c69edd9bde_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Black Diamond Viper Ice Tool" /></a></p>

<p>I did like the Viper Ice Tool which weighs 570 g with the Hammer or 595 g with the Adze and has an adjustable FlickLock Pommel - which, yes, employs the same FlickLock system as you already know it from BD Poles. It has a Titan pick and the head is modular, so on days where you need two Hammers or Adzes you can leave the other one at home (saving 80 g/ 105 g respectively, which yes, means, the “naked” tool weighs 490 g). This makes it the lightest BD ice tool yet, and being made from hydroformed aluminium these will last, too.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16695655422" title="Black Diamond Vapor Carbon 1 by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8565/16695655422_8091aeb8cd_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Black Diamond Vapor Carbon 1" /></a></p>

<p>The Vapor Carbon 1 poles weigh 310 g for the pair which makes it one of the lightest ski poles on the market. It’s a one-piece pole that’s made for ski-mountaineering - but that shouldn’t hinder the dedicated gram-weenie to use them for backpacking and pitching his shelter! Available in lengths of 115 to 145 cm in 10 cm steps they can be equipped with Powder Baskets and Freeride Baskets.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16696687575" title="Black Diamond Dawn Patrol 32 by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8634/16696687575_5c7ae756d5_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Black Diamond Dawn Patrol 32" /></a></p>

<p>The Dawn Patrol 32 is a mid-sized lightweight ski pack that can accommodate either skis or a snowboard and is AvaLung-Ready. The AvaLung Element is a streamlined, modular AvaLung unit that attaches to AvaLung-Ready packs and is a lightweight, affordable avalanche safety technology that significantly increases your fresh air supply in the event of a burial. The <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/black-diamond-avalung-brg/?pid=81">AvaLung</a> almost triples the air supply when you’re in an avalanche and at 100€ it is substantially cheaper than ABS packs et al.</p>

<h2 id="haglfs">Haglöfs</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15939316493" title="Haglöfs Hellner Gear by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7407/15939316493_bcfe6cd8b3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Haglöfs Hellner Gear" /></a></p>

<p>The new gear from <a href="http://www.haglofs.com/">Haglöfs</a> was interesting. The skiing gear developed with Marcus Hellner will delight the cross-country readers. Lots of Windstopper garments which keep cold wind out but are highly breathable, with body-mapping constructions and smart details like magnet closures. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16373587917" title="Haglöfs Barrier Pro III Belay Jacket by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8615/16373587917_55fcaed82a_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Haglöfs Barrier Pro III Belay Jacket" /></a></p>

<p>The Barrier Pro III Belay Jacket won an ISPO Gold Award and is a belaying jacket that’s mighty warm - too hot for me to wear indoors, so I quickly put it off again. Filled with QuadFusion™ Pro that has a windproof and waterproof membrane it keeps in the warm air generated by the body but is breathable enough to not be uncomfortable. The fit is to be worn over a Hardshell/ Softshell which is in my opinion also a great way to wear your insulation jacket during hiking/ skiing breaks.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15939328973" title="Haglöfs Mountain Pro by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7454/15939328973_0e1627983c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Haglöfs Mountain Pro" /></a></p>

<p>The Mountain Pro will only be available for Mountain Guides and SAR Employees - people who work in the mountains. Developed in cooperation with mountain professionals and the Swiss Alpine Rescue the garments are super burly and consists of the ROC Rescue Jacket, BARRIER Rescue Jacket, ROC Rescue Pants and ROC Rescue 40 backpack and are made to be
functional twelve months a year and be adaptable, not just to different weather conditions and temperatures, but also to different types of rescue missions. </p>

<h2 id="montane">Montane</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16080317554" title="Montane Primino Baselayer by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8562/16080317554_d85f3c7c29_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Montane Primino Baselayer" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.montane.co.uk">Montane</a>’s big news were the new Primino Baselayers, which combine Primaloft® yarns with Merino wool. These baselayers come 220 g and 140 g weights, with gloves, long johns and boxer shorts accompanying the tops. The idea is that the Merino wool draws vapour sweat away from the body whilst the Primaloft® yarns wick liquid sweat across the outer surface, allowing it to dry quickly. I got one here and will put it to the test so expect an update on them before next winter.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16495352457" title="Montane Black Ice 2.0 Jacket by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8564/16495352457_026e758e44_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Montane Black Ice 2.0 Jacket" /></a></p>

<p>The Black Ice 2.0 Jacket is Montane’s warmest down jacket and weighs 679 g in Size M. It is filled with 250 g of Primaloft Gold Insulation Down Blend and has a Freeflow Ultralite 38 g/m2 shell. The torso has a Boxwall construction while the sleeves have a Stitch-through construction. The hood has a wired peak and fits over a helmet. Toasty warm it was!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16701343571" title="Montane Hi-Q Luxe Jacket by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8652/16701343571_986c395d26_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Montane Hi-Q Luxe Jacket" /></a></p>

<p>Equally warm was the Hi-Q Luxe Jacket, which is filled with synthetic Primaloft Gold Luxe. Primaloft Gold Luxe is a new twist on the Thermoball technology of The North Face (which also was developed by Primaloft) I feel, which should be just like down but keeps you warm even when wet (unlike normal down, which collapses). The Hi-Q Luxe tips the scale at 575 g in Size M so isn’t too light, but it packs small and would make a good layering piece on cold days - but thanks to the Pertex Quantum shell you also can wear it on its own!</p>
