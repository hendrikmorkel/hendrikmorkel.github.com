    <id>http://hikinginfinland.com/2016/09/arcteryx-workshop-tour</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Canada is not just home to some fantastic mountains, <a href="http://www.hevydevy.com">great music</a> and a <a href="https://twitter.com/JustinTrudeau">cool Prime Minister</a>, also Arc’teryx hails from the largest North American country. Last December I flew to Vancouver to cover the unveiling of the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/12/arcteryx-voltair-avalanche-airbag.html">Voltair Avalanche Airbag</a> and the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/12/arcteryx-procline-carbon-lite-ski-boot.html">Procline Carbon Lite Ski Boot</a>. While there my colleagues and me were also treated to a tour of the Arc’teryx design studio and the factory, where iconic Arc’teryx garments like the Alpha SV Jacket are made. </p>

<p>What goes into designing a jacket like the <a href="http://www.arcteryx.com/product.aspx?language=EN&amp;gender=Mens&amp;category=Shell_Jackets&amp;model=Alpha-SV-Jacket">Arc’teryx Alpha SV Jacket</a>? How is it made? Who makes it? Where is it made? After my visit to the Arc’teryx factory in North Vancouver - one of four factories Arc’teryx operates in Canada - these are questions I feel I have the answers to. If you’re a gear nerd like me then visiting a factory - an Arc’teryx factory! - is like entering the holy halls of outdoor gear making. There’s so much skill and knowledge going into making these garments which we take out to the mountains and forests on our adventures that it’s inspiring to see it happen in front of your eyes, ask questions and of course take photos. The good lad that I am, well-knowing fellow gear nerds would also love to read about a Arc’teryx factory visit, I am here sharing my visit in photos and words with you. After that you’ll see your Arc’teryx hardshell with new eyes, realizing what amount of work went into it!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29965146626/in/dateposted/" title="Material Reception"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/6/5819/29965146626_e30d910a38_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Material Reception" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29371597604/in/dateposted/" title="What keeps you dry?"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/6/5498/29371597604_93696ec186_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="What keeps you dry?" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Every garment that is made in North Vancouver starts at the receiving area. Rolls of Gore-Tex, Polartec and many more fine materials arrive here in dozens of colours, and if you’re a MYOG enthusiast this probably is heaven already for you. As the 300 employees at this factory are super-efficient, though, those rolls of fabric don’t stay long there. Soon they end up on one of the long cutting tables.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29371596414/in/dateposted/" title="Cutting tables"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8673/29371596414_3a1b8ccba7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Cutting tables" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29372547703/in/dateposted/" title="How much can you fit on one?"><img src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/6/5248/29372547703_e22d4ebfc6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="How much can you fit on one?" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>There many, many sheets of fabric are layered carefully on top of each other, with a final paper layer which has all the patterns printed on it. These are designed in the most-efficient way so that as little material is wasted as possible. Then the gentlemen above - who does this since many years, and yes, still has all his fingers! - takes a super-sharp cutter machine to cut them up into the pieces of fabric which later make up the garments. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29965146226/in/dateposted/" title="Arc&#x27;teryx Veilance"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8548/29965146226_b87fc94070_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Arc&#x27;teryx Veilance" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Speaking of garments, made in this factory are besides some iconic jackets like the Alpha SV Jacket which you’re likely most-familiar with also <a href="http://veilance.arcteryx.com/Home.aspx?language=EN">Arc’teryx Veilance</a> garments, those awesome blazers and raincoats which are made of the same high-quality materials as the outdoor garments but with tons more style. You could wear a Veilance Blazer to a meeting with Justin Trudeau and wouldn’t look out of place, so classy are these garments. But the alpine mountain nerd I am we concentrated on checking out how the Alpha SV is made (and yes, I’d love to own a Veilance coat &amp; go back to see how it is made!).</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29916107731/in/dateposted/" title="Made by hand!"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8410/29916107731_db2188d10c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Made by hand!" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29916107531/in/dateposted/" title="Alpha SV in the making"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/6/5530/29916107531_224ede5bc7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Alpha SV in the making" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Making the jacket takes around 280 minutes over 197 work steps. The jacket travels over 30 workstations until it is labelled and ready, and has been worked on by 13 people. Arc’teryx inspires to make the fastest and best apparel factory plant, and where do you go to learn about efficient manufacturing? To Japan and Toyota with their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing">lean manufacturing</a> methodology. This resulted in the employees in Vancouver learning new skills so they can do more work steps in one go, which minimizes the travel &amp; waiting time between work steps. Now one worker can for example sew a seam, then tapes it and then applies some Arc’teryx magic to it (Sorry, I can’t say what that magic is as I signed an NDA!) and can pass it on to the next worker along the line, instead of three workers doing each step individually. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Speaking of the workers, they learn in a 12 week sewing training programme all the skills they need to work at the Arc’teryx factory - from sewing over taping and learning about the Lean programme. They have a 94% graduate rate of this programme, and the employees made a happy &amp; proud impression on me. Arc’teryx cares well for their employees, with regular breaks, being able to switch up stations, good pay - and many were also sporting Arc’teryx garments, some even garments which they sewed just for themselves! The trainees of the sewing programme also do good, as they make from excess material Ponchos for the homeless of Vancouver and give these away for free to those in need. </p>

<p>Back to the Alpha SV. There’s 48 jackets made per day in Vancouver, and each jacket is controlled during different stages of the manufacturing process. Some jackets get into the water pressure test to see if the material is good, and at the end the jacket gets its label and is ready to go on adventures with you. As you can imagine, it was inspiring to see this jacket being made - from the fabric over the cutting to the different steps, slowly the jacket started to take shape. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29371602664/in/dateposted/" title="Yarn"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8113/29371602664_363fe1b77c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Yarn" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>After our visit to the factory we went to the design studio. If you thought it couldn’t get better after a visit to the Arc’teryx factory - I was in awe about what I just saw! - you’re in for a treat. Because what gets made at the factory is imagined &amp; designed in the studio. Here you find a small factory floor itself, where Greg &amp; his colleagues can create a jacket (or one-offs for athletes! What we saw there was AMAZING!) in a few hours and then pass it on to one of their athletes for testing. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29965148436/in/dateposted/" title="Design Studio Bird&#x27;s Eye View"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8277/29965148436_f5822d1a91_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Design Studio Bird&#x27;s Eye View" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The designers are usually working on garments that comes out three years down the line, so right now they will be designing &amp; testing garments which hit the stores in Fall 2019. I imagine it gets quite hard to make sure you’re not spilling secrets at meetings and trade shows if you’re working so far in advance! </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29999090935/in/album-72157661450855749/" title="Designing"><img src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/6/5832/29999090935_5447f941ab_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Designing" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Finally we also got to take a peek into the Arc’teryx workshop, where they build machines and things they can not get anywhere else. They got all the fancy machines which you can imagine, and it is in part thanks to that workshop and the people there that Arc’teryx can come up with new innovations for manufacturing and in apparel technology. </p>

<p>After this fantastic tour of the factory, workshop and design studio we were treated to the brand-new, never-before seen <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/12/arcteryx-procline-carbon-lite-ski-boot.html">Procline Carbon Lite Ski Boot</a> and <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/12/arcteryx-voltair-avalanche-airbag.html">Voltair Avalanche Airbag</a> presentation, which we’d be testing a day later out in the backyard of Arc’teryx in British Columbia. But that’s a story for another day!</p>

<p>Even if you’re not able to go visit the Arc’teryx design studio - with the <a href="http://hiveclimbing.com/northshore/">Hive North Shore Climbing Gym</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Deep+Cove+Brewers+and+Distillers/@49.306442,-123.011479,19z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xb2f93ee1ea666c14!8m2!3d49.3063074!4d-123.0117136?hl=en-US">Deep Cove Brewers and Distillers</a> they have a great bouldering gym and craft beer brewery in the same building which means you sort of can visit Arc’teryx - and you might even run into Arc’teryx employees &amp; athletes there! </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29646888770/in/dateposted/" title="GoPro HERO4 Session"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8328/29646888770_5e14d97ac1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="GoPro HERO4 Session" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I met GoPro at the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/02/ispo-2016-news-iii.html">ISPO</a> earlier this year and had a nice chat with them, and when they asked if I’d be interested in testing their HERO4 Session I said yes. While my experience with the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2011/10/gopro-hd-hero2.html">GoPro Hero 2</a> was more like <em>Meh</em> and also the Garmin Virb was something I seldom would take along, I have had the HERO4 Session a lot outdoors in the last months. As a Photographer video is usually just a side-consideration for me, but as I am pondering videos more seriously it is nice to have a small, light and good video camera.</p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>As usually I put my <a href="http://shop.gopro.com/EMEA/cameras/hero-session/CHDHS-102-master.html">HERO4 Session</a> through a serious testing period to see how it performs in many different situations. The HERO4 Session arrived in February at Hiking in Finland HQ and has been along ski-touring in Norway, hiking, paddling and caving in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/07/multi-adventures-in-macedonia.html">Macedonia</a>, bouldering and sea kayaking on <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/08/cycling-and-bouldering-on-aland.html">Åland</a> and climbing, hiking and watching the sun set in Greece, and comes with me when I am going to South Tyrol next month and most likely also to Mexico in November. As the Session 5 was just announced last week I felt it is about time to review this wee camera cube (though GoPro wished I’d done it ages ago =). </p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>The GoPro HERO4 Session’s function is summed up pretty easily: Document your adventures, be they skiing in Lyngen, climbing in Greece, hiking in Finland or enjoying the beach with your family. It takes crisp 1080 HD Videos, makes pretty Timelapses and photos from your activities, and lets you easily share them. </p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M5XH4xSksyo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>One Button Video Recording - and push it once more to stop recording and turn the camera off</li>
  <li>One Button Timelapse out of the box, easy to adjust via the camera or the GoPro app on your phone</li>
  <li>Wifi and Bluetooth allows you to control the Session via your tablet or smartphone</li>
  <li>Waterproof to 10 m without a housing</li>
  <li>Dozens and dozens of mounts to attach it to almost anything imaginable</li>
</ul>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28810989151/in/album-72157672041470976/" title="On the way back to Mariehamn from Kobba Klintar"><img src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8695/28810989151_e0db3046b1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="On the way back to Mariehamn from Kobba Klintar" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>The Session is one of the smallest action cameras on the market. It’s a tiny cube which is why I found it so useful to take along on my trips. The “Press one button and it records” feature is also great, gone the times of where you’re wearing a GoPro and first push it on and then hit the record button, often not sure if it actually is now recording or not. That same button you can push a wee bit longer and it records a Timelapse, and this I found pretty cool as video and timelapse with one push of a button is a great step forward in user friendliness. </p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>The camera itself is high-quality and bumps into the rock wall, dropping it into my pack and letting it go dive in the salty Baltic and fresh water lakes didn’t bother it at all. The front lens glass protector has been kept scratch-free during all this time, one just needs to be careful to not touch it with greasy fingers as that can get messy (but easy enough to clean). I believe this camera can survive several years of use and abuse without problems. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26634868293/in/album-72157666107618714/" title="Exit through the Gift Shop"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/8/7419/26634868293_442d643a1e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Exit through the Gift Shop" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>The Session weighs a mere 71 g. Add in a case (16 g) and a mount like an <a href="http://amzn.to/2dt32sU">adhesive mount</a> (11 g) or the <a href="http://amzn.to/2cZCP9C">Tripod/ Selfie Stick</a> (215 g) and it’s a bit more, but especially with the latter you can take pretty ace photos and videos of yourself in action or fold the legs out and take a time-lapse of the sunset, all for a combined weight of 303 g (That’s the 3-Way Arm, a cage for the camera and the Session itself).</p>

<h2 id="sustainability--recyclability">Sustainability &amp; Recyclability</h2>

<p>You can <a href="http://shop.gopro.com/EMEA/refurbished/">buy refurbished cameras from GoPro</a> directly, which is a cool move and puts less GoPros into the waste streams of the world. Also on their website they have a lengthy website dedicated to <a href="https://gopro.com/casupplychaindisclosure">social and environmental matters</a>, while <a href="https://gopro.com/goproforacause">GoPro Cause</a> lets you get involved or donate with social projects around the world.</p>

<p>How to get rid of an old GoPro, though? If you life in Europe you should be aware of the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/weee/index_en.htm">WEEE Directive</a> which means electronic waste does not belong into your normal household waste. It gives you ideas where you can get rid of your old camera (and other electronic garbage, like that TV, the old Playstation and the broken cellphone from 2003). </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29857913641/in/dateposted/" title="The tiny GoPro HERO4 Session likes the autumn"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5542/29857913641_e98d176270_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="The tiny GoPro HERO4 Session likes the autumn" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p>I have used the HERO4 Session more as I thought I would. Unlike some of my blogger friends (Hey there <a href="http://www.travelingjackie.com">Jackie</a>!) who often only use a GoPro and their smartphone my main tool is a <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/photography/">camera</a> as I earn money with my photography. Now while the Session does take photos they’re usually not something a magazine is looking for, hence I carry my <a href="http://amzn.to/2drNeXo">Sony RX 100 IV</a> wherever I go. But the HERO4 Session is so small, light and intuitive that it’s a great addition to a small camera, especially for activities like climbing, skiing and cycling where it’s nice to attach the camera to yourself or your equipment and film your adventure. </p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lI1uuFphJSU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>What I like most about the HERO4 Session - and I might repeat myself here - is that it is so easy to use. Push the button and it records - push again and it’s finished. Push the button 3 seconds and it starts to record a timelapse. Push again and it stops. Accessing the settings is easy on the device as the User Interface is really smartly designed, and you can change the camera angle (from wide to medium), timelapse settings - from 0,5 seconds to 60 seconds - and a bunch more, all via the two buttons on the camera</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29646889400/in/dateposted/" title="GoPro HERO4 Session SD Card and USB Door"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8010/29646889400_4f4f9edb42_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="GoPro HERO4 Session SD Card and USB Door" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>All you need to start is a <a href="http://amzn.to/2cFiX8B">MicroSDXC Card</a> and you’re ready to head out. The <a href="http://amzn.to/2cZCP9C">GoPro 3-Way Grip &amp; Tripod</a> aka a fancy Selfie Stick with tripod legs that hide away has been something that I was very sceptical of (who wouldn’t be sceptical of Selfie Sticks?) but after using it a couple of times and seeing what great footage one can shot with it I was a convert. Now my Session is usually connected to the 3-Way Grip, as it allows for cool angles on the go, a more stable flow when hiking (though I’d like a gimbal for it) and the Tripod legs make it great for filming a timelapse. </p>

<p>The camera is also really durable - bumps against the rock when climbing didn’t bother it, it dived in and out of salt and fresh water without problems, and also took the daily abuse of being carried in a sidepocket or backpack without problems.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29826592252/in/dateposted/" title="GoPro 3-Way Arm &amp; Tripod + legs"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8212/29826592252_1c7fa02698_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="GoPro 3-Way Arm &amp; Tripod + legs" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The battery life depends quite a bit on how you use the camera, the temperature, and also if you have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth turned on or off (off means longer battery life but then you can’t control it with your phone). I had the HERO4 Session along in Macedonia and Greece and got a solid two weeks of use out of the camera, and if my memory doesn’t betray me I only once topped it shortly up in the middle of the trip. I take short clips - anything between 10 seconds and 3 minutes, as well as timelpases. Overall I got some 5 timelapses and around 60 clips shot during those two weeks, almost on a single charge (topped up once!). As the HERO€ Session can be charged via USB it is easy to charge it on the trail with a power bank, too. GoPro themselves also answers the <a href="https://gopro.com/support/articles/hero4-session-battery-life">battery life question</a> in detail.</p>

<p>What I found really great is that you can connect the Session to your smartphone, grab a photo or video, edit it on your phone and share it on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hendrikm/">Instagram</a>. Put the camera down and control the Session from your phone - hit record, adjust settings, whatever. It is so easy, you’ll love this feature if you use Social Media and previously just sat on a ton of footage but never did anything with it. There’s even the possibility to <em>find your GoPro</em> in case you’ve lost it under a bunch of papers! </p>

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29646896530/in/dateposted/" title="Viewing the Media on the GoPro HERO4 Session"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8448/29646896530_bb2fbfe0a6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Viewing the Media on the GoPro HERO4 Session" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Speaking of editing, GoPro has its own <a href="https://shop.gopro.com/EMEA/softwareandapp/">Apps</a> - for free! - which help you make a movie out of that footage. On the phone and desktop you even can let the App do all the work and you just sit back and see what it comes up with! </p>

<p>As for the footage coming out of it, I found it very nice indeed - for online publication. The photos (see the kayaking photo above) are of good quality for blogs and Social Media and probably could be used in a pinch in a magazine. The videos in 1080 HD are crisp with nice colours &amp; good sound, and the file size is wonderfully small in comparison what my other cameras throw out (as I already own four <a href="http://amzn.to/2dm7Z6l">HD External Hard Drives</a> storage is always a concern!). The HERO4 Session is a big step forward from my older action cameras, as adjusting from dark to bright is now quick &amp; good, and it even works great when <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hikinginfinland/videos/1193176694045994/">spelunking in dark caves with bats</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, while I got the HERO4 Session for free without obligations you can find the action camera for as little as 200€ (GoPro themselves ask for <a href="http://shop.gopro.com/EMEA/cameras/hero-session/CHDHS-102-master.html">230€ on their webstore</a>). That’s a pretty good price for such a well-designed camera, although there are action cameras out there which cost just half or less of that. If you’d like to support a company which in those cases rips off GoPro is up to you, I wouldn’t. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29314382373/in/dateposted/" title="GoPro HERO4 Session and lots of mounts"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8535/29314382373_91792ceef4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="GoPro HERO4 Session and lots of mounts" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="could-be-better">Could be better</h2>

<p>It is hard to pin-point things that I think could be better with the HERO4 Session, but as the HERO5 Session  was just launched I’d say GoPro addressed at least some of my concerns: Better video quality (now with 4K!) and Image stabilization. It now also has 10 Megapixel Photos but remains just as simple &amp; easy to use out of the box as the HERO4 Session I review here. But these were just tiny complaints from my side and I have been more than happy with the HERO4 Session.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29857687411/in/dateposted/" title="GoPro HERO4 Session - On"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8031/29857687411_3ea4033c53_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="GoPro HERO4 Session - On" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="competing-products">Competing Products</h2>

<p>There’s a range of Action Cameras which try to grab some of GoPros market share, most notably Garmin with the VIRB and Sony with its action cameras. Also DJI has tried to enter the market with the <a href="http://amzn.to/2d3fCkD">Osmo</a>, though it serves a slightly different niche. And then there’s the low-cost but still impressive action cameras which cost even less than the Session - I linked to some of these in recent <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/the-week-in-review/">The Week In Reviews</a> so browse them to read about these.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29826592702/in/dateposted/" title="GoPro HERO4 Session Outdoors"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7559/29826592702_395ccb285d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="GoPro HERO4 Session Outdoors" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>In the end the question you should ask yourself is: Do I need a one-click action camera? Are you out enough hiking, climbing, skiing, swimming, paddling, mountaineering, surfing &amp; cycling and wishing you had a small video camera along which films you &amp; your adventurous activities? Do you have the time afterwards to edit your footage and share it with your friends (or will you <a href="https://shop.gopro.com/EMEA/softwareandapp/">use the GoPro Quick Desktop or smartphone app</a> to do so)? Are you ready to drop around 300€ on the HERO4 Session, a MicroSDXC Card and some mounts?</p>

<p>If the answer is yes to all of these questions then I think you will find the GoPro Session a great little action camera. While I was sceptical if I’d use the Session at all - after all I hadn’t used the previous two action cameras I own in many years - it quickly has become something I take along on assignments &amp; when I head out for fun. Because it is so easy to use I am way more likely to actually take it out of my pack and push that button - knowing it will record crisp, cool videos of my friends &amp; me doing what we like most - being outside and having fun! Add in that it does so in an almost unobtrusive way, and that viewing, editing and sharing the footage I have recorded has never been easier and you have a winning package that fits in the palm of your hand.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-buy-it">Where to buy it</h2>

<p>As the Session 5 will come out in a few weeks the HERO4 Session - the one reviewed here - is available for good discounts already. <a href="http://bit.ly/2d9nrnr">REI</a> has a great package and you also find it at <a href="http://amzn.to/2cDx7aA">Amazon.com</a>, <a href="http://amzn.to/2d1EmYT">Amazon.co.uk</a> and <a href="http://amzn.to/2du8aA6">Amazon.de</a> for a good price. </p>

<h2 id="a-panorama-hike-in-the-brandnertal">A Panorama Hike in the Brandnertal</h2>

<p>Where did I leave off? Ah yeah, that I just came back to our apartment after my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/09/family-adventures-in-vorarlberg.html">Sunrise hike up the Kanisfluh</a>, ready for a day full of family adventures. With such a good weather forecast - the first really sunny day during our stay - we decided to head to the neighbouring Brandnertal and hike on the family-friendly <a href="https://www.vorarlberg-alpenregion.at/brandnertal/bergbahnen/angebot-am-berg/naturspruengeweg/">Natursprünge-Weg Brandnertal</a>. After a drive of a bit over an hour we arrived in Studa and took the Dorfbahn up the mountain. There we switched into the Panoramabahn which brought us over to the start of the nature experience trail, which has been created in cooperation with the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/09/family-adventures-in-vorarlberg.html">inatura museum</a>. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29538786880/in/dateposted/" title="Up with the cable car"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7569/29538786880_53f3da0611_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Up with the cable car" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>But first it was already again lunch time, and so we sat down at <a href="http://www.frööd.at">Frööd</a> and ate to strengthen us for the stroll through the mountains. The food was tasty, as were their home-made lemonades, and the playground keeps kids active for a long time! Add in great views and you might just be inclined to sit on the terrace and sip cold drinks!</p>

<p>But we weren’t there to sit out a sunny day on a terrace and so we soon started to hike on the interactive Natursprünge Weg. In regular distances you find information stations which explain a certain topic - from the views over geology to respect for nature, it’s a wide array of topics which you can find out about. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29748736891/in/dateposted/" title="Natursprünge-Weg Brandnertal"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8033/29748736891_dcb20ae59d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Natursprünge-Weg Brandnertal" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>It was a wide, hard path which was OK to walk - the views were spectacular, though on a sunny day the lack of shadow could be causing trouble when on the trail with little kids, so always bring enough water, a longsleeved shirt and pants and a sun hat to protect the little hikers. Also the relative long distance (it’s around 90 minutes walking time with kids, so maybe close to 6 km) could be a problem, as there’s no shortcut. However, you can loan a handcart from the second station which would allow you to pull your kids down the trail, making it easier!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29748739211/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Eagle"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8547/29748739211_5daac6f772_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Eagle" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29748740181/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Barefoot trail at the end of the Natursprünge-Weg Brandnertal"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/8/7523/29748740181_ab82290f79_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Barefoot trail at the end of the Natursprünge-Weg Brandnertal" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>At the end we passed another Restaurant and the start of a Barefoot Trail which looked pretty nice, but we just went straight for the cable car as our little one was getting pretty tired and needed to get into bed soon! All in all the Natursprünge Trail was a good experience, but we did like the Panorama Trail in Bezau (read about it underneath) more as it was a lot prettier. </p>

<h2 id="a-barefoot-hike-in-bizau">A Barefoot Hike in Bizau</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.bizau-bregenzerwald.com/sommer/sport-freizeit/wandern/barfussweg/">Barfußweg Bizauer Moos</a> is a great little hike for friends of barefoot walking! It was also very close to our <a href="http://www.appartements-wuestner.at">apartment in Mellau</a> - a short bus ride from Mellau to Bizau and we could start! We followed the trail markers over narrow paths and wider streets to the start of the barefoot trail, which runs all the time along the short (or through) the little Ulve creek which finds its way through the highmoor. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29538800070/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Kanisfluh"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8208/29538800070_9ceeae31bd_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Kanisfluh" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Once we reached it we told our four year old son that we will now continue without shoes. He was highly sceptical and needed some serious convincing, but after he saw that mom and dad were walking through the muddy puddles he was all in favour of barefoot hiking! The barefoot trail runs mostly on grassy trails, with a few crossings of the ice-cold creek.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/27688676552/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Ice-cold on the Barefoot Trail in Bizau"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7188/27688676552_38b75b524b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Ice-cold on the Barefoot Trail in Bizau" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29718474512/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Barefoot!"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8179/29718474512_816cdfccf3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Barefoot!" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Our son really liked the ice-cold crossings, and loved it even more if he could make dad cross the creek twice =) The highmoor is beautiful, with colourful wildflowers all around and great views on the surrounding mountains. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29718476562/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Colourful"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8284/29718476562_d1def7a701_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Colourful" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>At the end the trail runs in tight curves there and back, but always along the little creek, sometimes now also on duckboards (which can be very slippery with wet, muddy feet!) but mostly on grassy trails. Once you see the yellow-green bench you know that you’ve made it to the end of the trail! Now it’s time to wash your feet a final time in the cold creek - hopefully you brought a towel! - and get back into your shoes (unless you’re a monkey like me and have your <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/luna-sandals-oso.html">Luna Sandals</a> along!) and continue - for example towards <a href="http://www.jagdgasthaus-egender.at">Jagdgasthaus Egender</a> in Schönenbach, where you can taste the best Kässpätzle of the whole region!</p>

<h2 id="hiking-on-the-panaoramaweg-bezau">Hiking on the Panaoramaweg Bezau</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://touren.vorarlberg.travel/de/tour/wanderung/bezau-panoramaweg-baumgarten/2952601/">Panaoramaweg Bezau</a> was our absolute highlight of the trip to the Bregenzerwald in Vorarlberg. It was again very close to where we stayed in Mellau - a mere 10 minute Bus ride! - and the scenery, the lovely little path, the great Restaurant and the amazing views really made this hike stand out. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29204076584/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Up into the fog"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8016/29204076584_3ae5ea3718_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Up into the fog" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>It started with a cable car ride up into the clouds for us four, and we took the pram along - which we then left at the Restaurant as the trail didn’t accommodate a pram (it was very washed out and there were some gates where you would have to lift it over it). We had a quick lunch - tasty soups and bread - while the clouds were racing around us. As the weather cleared up we made our first start at hiking the Panorama Trail. </p>

<p>But then the clouds and rain came back, and so we turned around to sit it out. Good thing the restaurant has a very nice playing corner where the kids could entertain themselves =)</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29205364873/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Playground"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8348/29205364873_a68dd68e37_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Playground" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Then the weather cleared up again and we made our second try. With rain jackets on we left the Restaurant and hiked up the narrow, washed-out trail while a little creek was flowing down. Blue sky started to gain the upper hand and the grey rain clouds moved on to other places. </p>

<p>The views on the trail are simply outstanding: Even on this cloudy day you could see the Alps in Switzerland, the commanding Kanisfluh which is the landmark peak of the Bregenzerwald, to the north over the low, lovely foothills of the Alps, the Allgäu and Lake Constance, and then to imposing mountains to the south. 
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29748743091/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Bodensee views"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8491/29748743091_0b35ede8a9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Bodensee views" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The trail was great for kids, always interesting - from Paragliders that were taking off to sheep - and kept our son in high spirits throughout the hike. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29748743501/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Inside the Chapel"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8549/29748743501_de015822f1_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Inside the Chapel" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We had a look into the pretty Alpe Niedere chapel which was relatively new before we made the climb back towards the Restaurant and the cable car station. After an ice cream and Germknödel walked over to the cable car station and made the last cable car back to Bezau. This is a great and easy afternoon or morning out for a family with kids, even in moody weather. We felt it had all you need for a family hike: Easy access, good food for kids, a spacious changing room, an interesting trail which isn’t too long and stunning scenery. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29617903071/in/dateposted/" title="Stamps &amp; Postcards"><img src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/8/7784/29617903071_97697360f1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Stamps &amp; Postcards" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I just was at the post to drop a parcel, and what do my eyes espy? Outdoor-themed stamps! I had to pick up a package of each and share these with you! I love getting hand-written postcards from friends, and even more if there’s a nice stamp on the card. You thus can imagine I was pretty happy to see out of three new stamp sets which were just released that two had a theme that encouraged people to go outdoors! </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29617901821/in/dateposted/" title="Everyman&#x27;s Right Stamps"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8159/29617901821_cbe5a4cd30_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Everyman&#x27;s Right Stamps" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29617901121/in/dateposted/" title="Everyman&#x27;s Right Stamps inside"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8008/29617901121_82367a2f27_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Everyman&#x27;s Right Stamps inside" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Everyman’s Right Set includes six Class 1 stamps with topics like picking berries, camping in a tent in nature, ice fishing and cross country skiing. There’s a stamp for each season in this set, and I find these great because they help remind Finns about there basic human right, the Everyman’s Right - and maybe indirectly encourages them to get out into nature (because, you remember, <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/09/get-out-into-nature-because-itsgreatoutthere.html">#ItsGreatOutThere</a>!). I can picture some office worker getting a letter in winter with the XC skiing or ice fishing stamp on it, and how he lightens up because he remembers how good it felt to do these activities outside. Then after work this person would head home, switch into his outdoor clothes and grab the skis or ice fishing rod and head outdoors! I really hope this happens =)</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29587539992/in/dateposted/" title="Mushroom Stamps"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7581/29587539992_000962500d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Mushroom Stamps" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Autumn on the other hand is mushroom season and the theme of the other set. Gathering mushrooms is another very great reason to go into the forest and spend some quality time in the fresh air. My family and me, we love to go outside and hunt for mushrooms - and coming home &amp; being able to eat what you just gathered is just a great way to finish the day. We absolutely love the Horn of Plenty (commonly also called the Black Trumpet mushroom) and can highly recommend trying them if you have the chance. They’re also usually growing again in the same spots every year in our experience, so once you have found a good spot - remember it! Again I can envision how someone would get a letter with one of these mushroom-themed stamps and is encouraged to grab a basket, mushroom knife and guide book and heads into the woods to gather some tasty mushrooms! </p>

<h2 id="a-ride-with-the-wlderbhnle">A Ride with the Wälderbähnle</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://waelderbaehnle.at">Wälderbähnle</a> is what puts big smiles on kids’ faces - and adults if they’re trainspotters! My son is a big, big railroad fan and the possibility to ride on a train in great mountain scenery was a highlight for him. From the moment he woke up until we finally went to the railway station he was asking about it, and then it finally was time to climb aboard our carriage and enjoy the journey. </p>

<p>The Wälderbähnle offers two different rides: One with an old Diesel engine which runs most often and the more rare Steam Engine which pulls the eight or so carriages - including a Café! - from Bezau to Schwarzenberg through the beautiful mountains of the Bregenzerwald. We were pulled by the red Diesel engine and took a look at the Steam engine in the halls of the railway station of Bezau as we were back. It’s a short ride - the from Bezau to Schwarzenberg and back takes a bit over an hour, this includes the engine switching from one side to the other one when it goes back. All along the way you could see the mountains, crossed the Bregenzer Ache river and passed cows which were enjoying the fresh grass on the meadows along the tracks. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29360205760/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Sonderzug"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8500/29360205760_45be850d44_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Sonderzug" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The ride was very popular with families and our carriage had at least a dozen kids between 0 and 12 in it - and as Kids under six are free of charge it’s not expensive either. You buy your ticket at the railway station in Bezau before you jump on the train, although you can <a href="http://waelderbaehnle.at/fahrplanbetrieb-preise-2016">reserve a ticket online</a> too, which is probably recommended for the days when the steam engine pulls the train.</p>

<h2 id="hiking-around-mellau">Hiking around Mellau</h2>

<p>We stayed with the Family Wüstner in Mellau, at one of their <a href="http://appartements-wuestner.at">Apartments</a> which were great for a family of four. Mellau is a small village which has everything we needed: A Supermarket for grocery shopping, very frequent bus connections to any place in the region, a cable car up the mountain, bike rentals and outdoor shops, plenty of Cafés &amp; restaurants and last, but certainly not least: A big hiking trail network. Right in front of our house started the Flusswege Path which runs along the Bregenzer Ache and explains on pretty info boards about the flora &amp; fauna of the river. At the end of the path you also can make a short stroll over to the impressive waterfall and then head back to Mellau, where one of the nice Cafés is waiting to help you with a good serving of coffee &amp; strudel =)</p>

<p>I also stole away for an evening hike up towards the Gopfberg, and again the trail started pretty much in front of our house. It was a nice walk up into the dusk and once I reached the start of the forest after all the meadows I was tempted to make a run for the summit and back, but without a headlamp on me I decided it’s smarter to simply stroll back down and watch the night fall over the small village. There is, however, the possibility to walk around the Gopfberg, something I want to do on my next trip there!</p>

<h2 id="a-visit-to-metzler-naturhautnah">A Visit to Metzler Naturhautnah</h2>

<p>When it rained just too much for a hiking trip we went and visited <a href="https://www.molkeprodukte.com">Metzler Naturhautnah</a>, a dairy farm with 100 goats and 20 cows which also produces cosmetics from the whey. We got a guided tour of the dairy and saw how tasty cheese was made, petted the goats in their adventure playground stable and then also tasted the delicious cheeses. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29026415093/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Goats!"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8285/29026415093_0f2bfec54b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Goats!" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>From the bus stop in Egg it is a short walk up to the farm of Family Metzler. It lays scenically up a hill with a great view of the mountains, and the buildings themselves are also aesthetically very pleasing to look at, the big stables being constructed from wood in a modern design. The tour started at the shop where the daughter in law welcomed us and showed us around, answering all our questions about cheese making, goats and cosmetic products. ly stopped, too, and so we walked through the wet and cloudy hills down to catch our bus back to Mellau =)</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29026415553/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Metzler Hautnah products"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8328/29026415553_5a469b1f7a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Metzler Hautnah products" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We then continued to the stable where we spent some quality time with the lovely goats, petting them and looking how they “played” around. This was great for our son, as nowadays it isn’t so often that you can get up close and friendly with a goat and other animals. Hungry we continued to the pretty Conference room slash Café where we had a super-tasty cheese lunch, with almost a dozen different cheeses and fresh bread. Once it was time to leave the rain happi</p>

<h2 id="inatura-museum">Inatura Museum</h2>

<p>The next morning it was again raining hard. Happily we had another rainy-day alternative on our list: A visit to the <a href="http://www.inatura.at/home/">Inatura Museum</a>. Situated in Dornbirn it was an hour bus ride from Mellau to get there, but with the great local bus system it meant we jumped on just one bus and get out in Dornbirn an hour later!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29569577291/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Innatura Museum"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8088/29569577291_dd889afc82_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Innatura Museum" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Located in an old factory the museum is from the outside and inside a real pearl and such a great place to visit that we really enjoyed our time in it. From the temporary exhibition about beavers to the five permanent exhibitions, the inatura is a museum which wets the appetite of old &amp; young for knowledge and which encourages its visitors to touch and try things; especially in the Sciences Zones which one finds throughout the buildings you can see how magnetism works, play with cog wheels and see lots of fish swim happily in big tanks. Add in a nice Café, friendly &amp; helpful staff and you have a great destination to spend a rainy day and keep the kids happy! </p>

<h2 id="sunrise-hike-up-the-kanisfluh">Sunrise hike up the Kanisfluh</h2>

<p>Wednesday: Rain.
<br />Thursday: Rain. 
<br />Friday: Sunshine. </p>

<p>I guess that means I will get up at 2:30 am so I can watch the sun rise from the summit of the Kanisfluh, the landmark of the Bregenzerwald. I have seen the impressive mountain every day from Mellau &amp; our adventures there, and was eager to pay the summit a visit to enjoy the vast views from the summit. Combining it with the best light of the day was a no-brainer, and so I sneaked out of the apartment while the family continued to sleep. In the middle of the night I met mountain guide Matthias and my fellow sunrise hikers at the Tourist Office in Mellau; then we squeezed into Matthias’ car to ride to the other side of the mountain where our hike would start. </p>

<p>The stars were still out when we set off from the car, but it wasn’t long until that magic light of pre-dawn started to arrive and colour the sky into the prettiest pastel colours. </p>

<p>We reached the summit cross a mere 45 minutes after we started hiking and weren’t the only ones up there who were waiting for the sun to rise. A group of friends  which set off way before us was shivering at the cross, waiting for the warm rays of the sun to warm them up. I slipped into my puffy jacket, took my camera and looked for the best angles.</p>

<p>And then the sun came. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29024563664/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Sunrise"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7554/29024563664_3e538de954_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Sunrise" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We watched fascinated as the sun rose slowly over the horizon, and pastel colours slowly gave way to oranges and yellows, but before long the light of day was around us. Matthias shared a zip from his flask, and then it was time to start the descent.</p>

<p>While it would have been tempting to eat breakfast on the mountain hut close to our car I promised my family to be back for breakfast, and low &amp; behold: As I arrived back at the apartment with fresh, warm rolls from the supermarket the kids were just getting up. Over breakfast we were pondering what we should do on this beautiful, sunny day together!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Its Great Out There</em> has been my thinking since I started to regularly go outdoors and climb, hike, packraft, cycle or camp. Why I thinks that way you find out in this post!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/27700551721/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Sunrise on the Kanisfluh"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7180/27700551721_12abb83624_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Sunrise on the Kanisfluh" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>In last years #MyWeek #BeActive Challenge you got a <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/08/take-part-in-the-myweek-beactive-challenge.html">permit to get outdoors</a>, and following up on that initiative this year the European Outdoor Group wants you to realize once more that <a href="http://www.itsgreatoutthere.com">#ItsGreatOutThere</a>. If you <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hendrikm/">follow me on Instagram</a> you probably have seen that hashtag quite a bit, because I honestly prefer being outside instead of standing in front of my desk. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26965430150/in/album-72157666107618714/" title="Paddling at Matka Canyon 01"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7138/26965430150_1868afd7c2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Paddling at Matka Canyon 01" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The #ItsGreatOutThere campaign’s believe - which I fully support - is that outdoor activites have an positive impact on individuals and society as a whole. Fitness, self-confidence, life skills, fun, health, unforgettable memories &amp; a sustainable connection with nature – that is the power of outdoor sports. Add in friends &amp; your family and you will create lasting memories &amp; bonds which you will fondly look back to in old age! I much prefer to spend my time in nature with the family &amp; friends instead of being in a busy city or working at the office. When the latter gets too much I jump on my bike and head out for a ride, coming back feeling much more satisfied and happy.</p>

<p>To help you realize that its better outside (just in case you have forgeotten ;) the European Outdoor Group has partnered with a lot of cool events &amp; companies to offer you some great prizes in their competitions this autumn. First off is the <a href="http://www.itsgreatoutthere.com/competition01-timeout/">timeout</a> competition where you can win two tickets for the The North Face Mountain Festival as well as some cool outdoor kit which makes autumn adventures warmer &amp; drier. Click that link if you feel like chilling with like-minded folks in Switzerland in the middle of September!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/23380978901/in/album-72157659581645884/" title="Hello Beach!"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/1/720/23380978901_4d30838bf6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Hello Beach!" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>But even if you don’t have the desire to go to Switzerland for hiking, camping, climbing and good campfire vibes, you always can use the #ItsGreatOutThere and #beactive hashtags when you’re outside. Be it your cycle commute to the office, an after-work run in the forest, a packrafting Microadventure at the weekend or going for a dayhike with the kids. Need some ideas how you can #BeActive? Here you go:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Explore a Nature trail near where you life</li>
  <li>Go geocaching</li>
  <li>Build a den in the forest with your kids</li>
  <li>Go bouldering</li>
</ul>

<p>And after that, share your outdoor fun with your friends &amp; followers on Social Media. Don’t forget to add the #ItsGreatOutThere and #BeActive hashtags - That’s it =) You now have a great permission to get outdoors and a superb excuse, too - in case you need one! Have fun and feel free to share your adventures with us in the comments underneath!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/08/outdoor-2016-news-tents.html">tents</a> and <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/07/outdoor-2016-news-stoves.html">stoves</a> it is time to take a look at backpacks that are coming for hikers &amp; climbers in 2017!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28874615013/in/dateposted/" title="HIKE with the Arc&#x27;teryx Bora AR Pack"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8378/28874615013_fc2f3945a8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="HIKE with the Arc&#x27;teryx Bora AR Pack" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Lets start with the <strong>Arc’teryx</strong> Bora AR Pack, which will debut in 2017 again - the Bora has been a very popular pack in the past but has been unavailable while it was being re-designed. Berrett Willet is the designer of the pack and showed me and <a href="https://twitter.com/WillWalksWales">Will from TGO</a> the pack and explained the ins-and-outs of it to us. The basic Bora design dates back to 1994 and the moveable hipbelt idea has been just as old, but it was back then not as easily to realize. Fast forward 20 years and manufacturing technologies and the possibility to design a reliable, moveable hipbelt are completely possible. The RotoGlide™ hipbelt and Tegris® back panel accommodate the movement of your back when you move up and down in the mountains: It glides up and down along its track to fluidly follow the lengthening &amp; straightening of your back and rotates freely along with the natural movement of your hips. The GridLock™ shoulder strap adjustment system allows the straps to be custom fit for both your height and width. It will come in a Women’s and Men’s version next year in Regular and Tall sizes, and in two volumes: 50 l and 63 l for men and 49 l and 61 l for women. The packs will retail for 470€ and 520€ respectively.</p>

<p>They’re made to haul heavy loads - think about moving to a far away wall you want to climb, carry gear in for a Backcountry skiing weekend, or just very long treks. For that they’re made from durable materials, to be precise from the N420r-AC2 waterproof fabric which is also used in the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/10/one-duffle-to-rule-them-all-the-arcteryx-carrier-duffle.html">Arc’teryx Carrier Duffle</a>. It has a large zippered pocket on the front, a zippered lid pocket and a side zipper which allows on-the-go access to the main compartment. Trekking poles and ice axes also can be attached. The packs are made in the Philippines and have been designed &amp; tested in Vancouver, B.C.</p>

<p>Made for fast &amp; light alpinists <strong>Black Diamond</strong> comes out with the Blitz pack, which will be available in a 20 and 28 l volume. The packs are made from Dyneema which makes them durable enough to be pulled up rough granite walls and dropped down crevasses, as well as daily contact with ice tools and crampons. It has a one-hand top closure which did remind me of the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/07/patagonia-ascensionist-pack-45l.html">Patagonia Ascensionist</a> lid design. There’s a waterproof zip pocket on that lid for small items, a rope strap carries the rope up and a removable bivy pad lets you shiver out the night up on the mountain. The Blitz 28 will weigh 444 g and the smaller 20 l version is 398 g.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28874603823/in/dateposted/" title="Black Diamond Blitz pack"><img src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8349/28874603823_79612f8377_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Black Diamond Blitz pack" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The <strong>Ortovox</strong> Trad 18 climbing pack weighs 198 g and come sin six visible colours. It’s much lighter than its big brother, the Trad 25 (which weighs 750 g!) but does pack quite some features. For starters there’s also a Patagonia Ascensionist-ish lid closure, while the pack rides low on your back so it does not interfere with your helmet. At the front there’s gear loops where you can clip in gear, while on the inside there’s a zippered valuables pocket and also a possibility to carry your hydration system. You can strap a rope to the top, too! </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28874612563/in/dateposted/" title="Ortovox Trad 18 climbing backpack"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8238/28874612563_fc4dbebaae_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Ortovox Trad 18 climbing backpack" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I don’t think the <strong>Gregory</strong> packs are as light as the Trad pack above (or other UL packs), but I have an spot for the brand in my heart as it was the first backpacking pack I ever bought. They still make super-large and heavy packs, but also some lighter packs are nowadays to be found from their line-up. The Paragon is one of these packs, available in four volumes from 38 l to 68 l it weighs between 1,36 kg and 1,64 kg. The Paragon (and the Maven Women’s model) comes in two adjustable back lengths and also the hipbelt is easily adjustable on the go. The new Aerolon suspension system is made from an ultra-lightweight 7001 aluminium tubular frame and is specially designed so that stability is not compromised when the back length is adjusted. The back panel is made from a light and airy matrix foam and covered in a mesh
fabric for good ventilation and increased wear comfort. The lid can be removed to save some more weight, and on the inside you find a the small Sidekick pack, which is a combination of hydration reservoir sleeve and ultra-light removable daypack. It lets you run to the peak and back with leaving the main pack at camp. The backpack has all the pockets you’d want, from a front mesh pocket over mesh side pockets and hipbelt pockets to a zippered lid pocket. </p>

<p>And finally a look at a pack from <strong>Helsport</strong> (<em>Disclaimer</em>: I’m a Helsport Ambassador). At 65 l volume it is slightly larger as most packs I am used to carry, but it does weigh <em>“only”</em> 2,1 kg for the S/M Size pack, so it’s not the heaviest pack here (that’s the Arc’teryx pack above). It has a rain cover included, the top lid can be carried as a small summit pack or in front of the chest as I demonstrate underneath, and there’s some other nice-to-have features on the pack which I will write more about after I have used it this autumn =)</p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>I got the <a href="http://www.swixsport.com/Products/Poles/Trekking-Poles/Swix-Sonic-Pro-Trail-Carbon">Swix Sonic Pro Trail Carbon 120</a> in July 2016 and have been using them on day hikes, a trail run and as poles for pitching my shelters on Microadventures. They haven’t seen as much use as I usually would put a piece of kit through before I write about them, but this being a sponsored post I sadly didn’t have the freedom to test them for 12 months &amp; longer =) However, I intend to take them along to a trip to the Alps this autumn where I’ll be backpacking for a week and after that I will feel more confident about a final statement.</p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>As I highlighted in my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/05/black-diamond-ultra-distance-trekking-poles.html">Black Diamond Ultra Distance Trekking Poles</a> Review, trekking poles have many advantages outdoors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They help you to keep your balance on difficult terrain</li>
  <li>Useful in fording rivers</li>
  <li>Can be transformed into a <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/10/trailpix-ultralight-tripod.html">tripod</a> or used with a <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2010/03/interview-rod-java-from-thestickpic-com.html">StickPic</a> for photography</li>
  <li>They can pitch your tarp or shelter</li>
  <li>They train your upper body muscles when hiking and running</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>The Swix Sonic Pro Trail Carbon is available in fixed lengths from 100 to 135 cm in 5 cm intervals. All of the poles have the following features in common:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Compact folding system</li>
  <li>Comfort Connection system</li>
  <li>Multi grip from cork with EVA extension</li>
  <li>Flexi basket system</li>
  <li>Swix carbon technology Swix CT1 grade</li>
  <li>Folded pack size is 39 cm</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>I’ve used a fair share of trekking poles, some lighter, some heavier. I can’t really say that these poles have any mind-blowing innovations in them, although there’s a few things I do like about them - read on to find out what.</p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>The quality is very good. The trekking poles make a solid impression, the construction of the segments is clean and smooth and they fit well together, and also the grip is well made (from European cork!). As Swix has many years of experience in the making of carbon poles (for cross country skiing) they were able to use this expertise and apply it to the production of their trekking poles.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28867841714/in/dateposted/" title="The Tip protector"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/8/7493/28867841714_414d044771_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="The Tip protector" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>My poles in 120 cm length weigh 153 g per pole including the little baskets, so the pair of them weighs 306 g. This makes them more heavy than my BD Poles, but I imagine this weight will reflect positively on the durability of the poles. On the plus side, that’s 29 g lighter as Swix claims they would be!</p>

<h2 id="sustainability--recyclability">Sustainability &amp; Recyclability</h2>

<p>Swix has a page about their interaction with the <a href="http://www.swixsport.com/Environment">environment</a>. On their page about <a href="http://www.swixsport.com/Environment/Swix-Products-and-the-Environment">Swix Products and the environment</a> they tell us rather broadly that <em>“Swix maintains a strong social responsibility program and has a focus on environmental awareness in product production. This is repeated in all aspects, both in the choice of raw materials, the use of recyclable packaging and more.”</em> This is not really going into details and doesn’t tell us much besides that they use recycable packaging. Happily there’s some more info on the <a href="http://www.swixsport.com/Environment/Swix-Environmental-Ethics">Swix Environmental Ethics</a> page, where they tell us that they do Climate accounting (with quite old data from 2009) and in which organizations they’re members. I would have wished for more infos on how &amp; where I could get a pole fixed and how I should get rid of them in case they break one day.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28867841314/in/dateposted/" title="The folding mechanism"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8679/28867841314_2f380b0500_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="The folding mechanism" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p>The Swix Sonic Pro Trail Carbon 120 Trekking Poles are for me a 3-season pole because of their cork grip - I imagine they would be OK when hiking in the winter as long as you don’t let the cork get wet. They come with indicated Left &amp; Right hand straps that sadly are not easy to remove. They are OK to use and don’t have any hard plastic parts which could push uncomfortably into the skin, but I really feel I don’t need them and want the option to easily remove them. <strong>Update</strong>: <em>Stian Hagen from Swix informed me that cork is great for winter use and that Swix has used all cork grips already since 20 years on the XC skiing poles. The friction of the cork is good, its light, and its warm.</em></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28872979203/in/dateposted/" title="L &amp; R straps"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8334/28872979203_778998eb0d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="L &amp; R straps" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>In use the cork handles are very comfortable, the cork grip lays good in the hand when hiking in flat terrain and up, while the rounded top is good to hold when descending. When navigating through steep terrain the longer EVA part makes gripping the pole lower nice, though as I said - I’d prefer a full cork grip. Even with sweaty hands in hot weather the cork feels more comfortable and doesn’t slip as easily as EVA. <strong>Update</strong>: <em>Stian Hagen from Swix let me know that they decided to use cork on the lower part as it saves weight and as it is not used that often they felt this was a good trade-off.</em></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28867837064/in/dateposted/" title="Handle of the Sonic Pro"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8020/28867837064_02007c24fe_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Handle of the Sonic Pro" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Because I don’t use poles all the time and often fly in a plane to go backpacking the weight and pack size are important to me. The Sonic Pro carbon are pretty good in that respect, as they fold small and fit into the side pocket of my LAUFBURSCHE pack or can be wrapped into a insulation jacket when travelling by plane. Because they fit inside of my pack I even was able to take them along as a carry-on, which is great when you’re flying without checked in luggage!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28873223823/in/dateposted/" title="Folded up for travel, fitting into a carry-on compliant pack!"><img src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8512/28873223823_883a00e6a7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Folded up for travel, fitting into a carry-on compliant pack!" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Flexi basket system is really great, I long have wished for an easy way to switch baskets on poles and this has been so easy to use, it’s a pleasure. Where other poles let you change baskets only with the use of lots of force or tools here I simply could unscrew the basket and screw on another one. The small baskets are fine for normal forest trails and established mountain trails, but for swamps and the crossing of summer snow fields a larger one would have been useful. Anyhow, the thread system is great.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28867842054/in/dateposted/" title="Basket of &amp; thread exposed"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8333/28867842054_1b6d9e805c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Basket of &amp; thread exposed" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Then to the most important job of my trekking poles: Pitching a shelter! For pitching tarps and pyramides I found the Sonic Pro Trail Carbon splendid because they are very stiff - much more stiff than my BD poles. This is especially good when a single pole is used for putting up a pyramide shelter as it flexes less when gusts hit the shelter, which I find feels safer.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28867841064/in/dateposted/" title="As a tent pole, looking up"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8045/28867841064_833e651a8b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="As a tent pole, looking up" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And finally deploying them and folding them up. Both are a breeze, fast &amp; easy. For getting them ready for hiking you simply hold the hand grip and pull the part out which automatically straightens the pole, until you hear a click and the button jumps out and locks the segments in place. Folding the poles together is just as simple: Push the button back in and the upper part moves slightly back into the handle. Then just push the segment completely in and fold the pole together! Swix wrote that you can use the strap to keep the pole folded together, but I haven’t found out how to do that with a single pole. With both poles I just put them together with the straps on the opposite ends and then thread the segments through them, that way they stay together well. <strong>Update</strong>: <em>Stian Hagen from Swix showed me how to fold them together with one strap - see the photo underneath</em> =) </p>

<h2 id="could-be-better">Could be better</h2>

<p>I really like the cork grip and would wish the Sonic Pro Trail Carbon pole would have a complete cork handle, thus that the lower EVA part is also cork. It just feels more comfortable on the hand to me, and it’s a shame the lower part is made from EVA. I also would have wished that the strap would be easy to remove. I rarely use straps with poles in the summer and am sure I’d liked it better to save a few more grams than being forced to have it along. I also think that if one buys these poles that it’d be nice to get a choice of baskets with them, because the small trekking baskets aren’t really great in summer snow, swamps and boulder fields where a larger basket would make it easier for the pole not to penetrate too deep. Finally, a notch in the basket so they stay locked together when folded would have been useful, too.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: <em>Stian Hagen from Swix wrote me a lengthy Email with some more infos, which I included above already. Apparently it is super easy to remove the strap by just pushing the pin out with a narrow tool like a screw driver at home and then take out the strap. I tried this with some narrow tools but couldn’t get the pin pushed out. Either I’m too weak or possibly I still have a pre-production sample where it isn’t as easy. I’ll update this when I managed to get rid of the strap!</em></p>

<p>The at the beginning mentioned <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/05/black-diamond-ultra-distance-trekking-poles.html">Black Diamond Poles</a> are a worthy competitor which I know are very long-lasting &amp; robust, and if you can life with poles that have a larger pack size also the <a href="http://www.rutalocura.com/trekking_poles.html">Ruta Locura Yana poles</a> are great poles that I have used since many years very happily. If you need adjustable poles I’d check out the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/swix-sonic-x-trail-carbon-trekkingstoecke/?pid=10239">Swix Sonic X-Trail Carbon</a> which some of my friends will surely write about in a while!</p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>Despite not having used them as much as I’d like to the Swix Sonic Pro Trail Carbon 120 Trekking Poles have made a good first impression on me. They are light and comfortable when out hiking and backpacking, allow me to pitch my Pyramide shelters and tarps and let me train my upper body when out for a hike. Keep in mind that I still am not a big trekking pole user when hiking (I use them usually in difficult terrain and for river crossings) although I almost always carry a pair because I need them for my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/shelters/">shelters</a>. As I will be backpacking several more weeks this autumn and will take the Swix Sonic Pro Trail Carbon 120 poles with me for hiking and pitching my shelter I will try to update this article then and reflect on them again after more use.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-buy-it">Where to buy it</h2>

<p><em>Only BUY stuff if you really need it!</em></p>

<p>You can get the pole in every length from <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/swix-sonic-pro-trail-carbon-trekkingstoecke/?pid=10239">Bergfreunde</a> (On offer for 135€!) and <a href="https://www.bergzeit.de/swix-sonic-pro-trail-carbon-trailrunningstock/?pid=81">Bergzeit</a>.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28929325915/in/dateposted/" title="Helsport Spitsbergen X-Trem Camp"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8740/28929325915_47d23de81e_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1200" alt="Helsport Spitsbergen X-Trem Camp" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>As an <a href="http://www.helsport.no/hendrik-morkel">Helsport Ambassador</a> I obviously wanted to swing by at my partner and see what they have in store for 2017. What I saw was very much to my ultralight heart: The Lofoten Series. Helsport has most of their designs available in three to four different versions: The Trek version, which is heavier and the most affordable option. The colour of the fly of Trek tents is always a dark green, so they’re easy to distinguish. Next up are the Pro tents, which are made from slightly better &amp; lighter materials, and they have a green-yellow-ish fly. Next up are my favourite two series: The Pro Superlight tents with the blue flysheets, which are the lightest version of each design. And finally there’s the Extreme Series with their red-yellow flysheets. These are made for expeditions in any season, are super-durable and yet relatively light. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28273021860/in/album-72157667997710903/" title="Helsport Lofoten Series"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8511/28273021860_9677e89067_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Helsport Lofoten Series" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28353207676/in/album-72157667997710903/" title="Helsport Lofoten Superlight Camp3"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8654/28353207676_0034cf25da_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1069" alt="Helsport Lofoten Superlight Camp3" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>That above is the <strong>Lofoten Superlight Camp 3</strong> tent, a 3-person tunnel tent which weighs 1.850 g. It has two doors in the spacious vestibule which has enough space for cooking and gear. As you can see at the Pro Camp underneath, the front also can be stored completely away, allowing for lots of ventilation and great views from the sleeping area. The large vestibule is also great for those of us who travel with a large dog, a packraft or bike as there’s plenty of space for storage.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28273022640/in/album-72157667997710903/" title="Helsport Lofoten Series"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8568/28273022640_5e3d0ff397_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Helsport Lofoten Series" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The <strong>Lofoten Trek Camp</strong> tent above is available as a 3 and 5 person version. The 3-Person tent weighs 4.050 g and the 5-Person tent 4.800 g, so they’re better for short hiking or when you’re out with a canoe or bike. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28273023210/in/album-72157667997710903/" title="Helsport Lofoten Series"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8743/28273023210_bd0a50fc72_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Helsport Lofoten Series" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And the <strong>Lofoten X-Trem Camp 3</strong> tent here is the expedition version from the bunch. At 3.700 g it is best transported on a Pulka, but the DAC Featherlight NSL poles in combination with the design should withstand even the hardest wind gusts out in the fjell in winter. The sleeping compartment is 105 cm high, 220 cm long and 165 cm wide, so it is cozy but not too tight. Add in a 160 cm long vestibule and you have enough space for lots of kit and cooking. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28626218950/in/dateposted/" title="Helsport Bitihorn X-Trem Tarp"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8575/28626218950_4b58c508e4_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Helsport Bitihorn X-Trem Tarp" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And then there’s the <strong>Bitihorn X-Trem Tarp</strong> above, which also will be again as a Trek, Pro and Superlight Version. The X-Trem above is 435 cm x 435 cm large and is 1.340 g light, which is pretty good for such a massive tarp. The slightly smaller Superlight Tarp (350 cm long and 290 cm wide) is 400 g, which is pretty amazing if it is true. There will be poles available which are between 132 cm and 176 cm long and weigh 70 g and 220 g respectively. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28273009790/in/album-72157667997710903/" title="Nordisk Lofoten 1 ULW"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8897/28273009790_362c568d6d_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Nordisk Lofoten 1 ULW" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28273015090/in/album-72157667997710903/" title="Nordisk Lofoten"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8318/28273015090_e94812efe9_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Nordisk Lofoten" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The <strong>Nordisk Lofoten 1 ULW</strong> above aims for the throne of the lightest tent in the world, and with a packed weight of 575 g incl. pegs and poles and guylines it is pretty close to that throne. But how about the usability? Well, the seating height is 70 cm, which is pretty low, even for a small guy like me. People with big feet also might find the end of the tent constricting, For smaller backpackers who can cook with fair weather in front of the tent it might be good, but we longer people might find it a bit too small. I will sit back and wait what real-world reviews will say about the tent, and while the weight is exciting there’s a reason why Pyramide shelters are so popular: They’re even lighter and have plenty of room.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28626218200/in/album-72157667997710903/" title="Therm-A-Rest Tranquility 6 Tent"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8491/28626218200_8c2db08e39_h.jpg" width="1067" height="1600" alt="Therm-A-Rest Tranquility 6 Tent" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Talking of plenty of space, here’s a tent for Camping Enthusiasts: The <strong>Therm-A-Rest Tranquility 6 Tent</strong>. This two entry, two compartment, standing height tent is a great addition to the quiver if family Camping is in the books. Therm-A-Rest, which belongs to the Cascade family, picked the brains of the MSR tent designers while designing this tent, so expect this V 1.0 being actually quite good. It looked easy to pitch, with smart details like the protected corners in the entry for gear storage out of the muck and plenty of mesh inside pockets for storage. Certainly nothing for the UL backpacker, but if said UL backpacker takes the family along to a camping ground a good way to make all feel comfortable.</p>

<p>A tent used by <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/08/ueli-steck-interview.html">Ueli Steck</a> is the <strong>MSR Advance Pro 2</strong>. Ueli was let go by MH earlier this year and was happy to find a new home with MSR, and the Advance Pro 2 certainly looks like a great home away form the basecamp. It’s made for expedition use in demanding environments, but also should stand up to the elements in the hills and fjells of lesser ranges. It uses Easton Syclone poles which are made from aerospace-grade composite materials, which can flex further &amp; take more abuse than any other pole material - which makes them probably the most resilient tent pole ever made. It is pretty spacious for one and cozy for two, easy to set up and the small footprint also fits on narrow snow ledges high up. At 585€ it is not cheap, but hey - few tents are!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28273023950/in/album-72157667997710903/" title="4,99 € Tent"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8310/28273023950_093ad10ae2_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="4,99 € Tent" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>But if you prefer cheap, I found this gem of a tent. At 4,99€ the price is unbeatable, however, I reckon that’s what the lady charges you only if you order a significant quantity of these. You could gift all your friends and family for years to come with such a fine tent, though, if you decide to walk down that road.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28450559352/in/album-72157667997710903/" title="Marmot Bolt 2P tent"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8615/28450559352_06a898c045_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Marmot Bolt 2P tent" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28450559922/in/album-72157667997710903/" title="Marmot Bolt 2P tent"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8635/28450559922_75b7b5d1b0_h.jpg" width="1067" height="1600" alt="Marmot Bolt 2P tent" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Slightly more expensive, but undoubtedly better constructed &amp; designed is the <strong>Marmot Bolt 2P tent</strong>. Steep side walls ensure plenty of head room and a feeling of space in the 1.040 g light tent, and at 500€ it is also not overly expensive. The flysheet is highly waterproof and also UV resistent, which is good news for the longevity of the tent. There’s space for kit and cooking in the vestibule as I demonstrate so professionally above, and on the inside you also find Lamp-Shade-Pockets which diffuse the light of your headlamp for nice atmospheric light inside. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28313293173/in/dateposted/" title="Vaude Hogan SUL 1-2P"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8399/28313293173_97ea914ff8_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1200" alt="Vaude Hogan SUL 1-2P" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And lastly a quick look at the new tents from Vaude. I already shed some light on the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/07/outdoor-2016-first-gear-teasers.html">Hogan SUL 1-2P</a> and also in real life it looked good. A good seating height for me, a large vestibule and an overall streamlined and smooth design will make this already popular tent probably even more popular in the future. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28313294233/in/photostream/" title="Vaude Invenio SUL 2P Tent"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8589/28313294233_b55f848b08_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1200" alt="Vaude Invenio SUL 2P Tent" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28313295043/in/photostream/" title="Vaude Invenio SUL 2P Tent"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8815/28313295043_3c7efb1e02_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1200" alt="Vaude Invenio SUL 2P Tent" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The <strong>Vaude Invenio SUL 2P Tent</strong> got an overhaul for 2017, and the tent poles went now under the fly. Design-wise it reminded me of the Hubba/ Soloplex/ Notch shelters, with two doors opposite of each other. The flysheet can be rolled up on both sides for wide views outside and also otherwise this tent has all the bells and whistles along which you want from a tent.</p>

<p>Benjamin from hrXXLight also highlights <a href="http://hrxxlight.com/2016/07/outdoor-2016-news/#more-2405">some new tents</a>, and if you were this year at the OutDoor and have a post with tents online, please comment with a link and I’ll add it here!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Three times a charm, they say. My love affair with Åland went into the third round last week as I was photographing a story for the <a href="http://www.norrmagazin.de">NORR</a> and <a href="http://www.partioaitta.fi/365klubi/365-lehti">365 Magazine</a> about cycling, bouldering and sea kayaking on the beautiful Åland Archipelago between Finland and Sweden. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28810987961/in/album-72157672041470976/" title="Cloudporn over the Baltic."><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8358/28810987961_443a331b7c_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1200" alt="Cloudporn over the Baltic." /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/02/aland-in-winter.html">The last time I was on Åland</a> was just in January, and how different it was back then: The roads under snow and ice, the Baltic partially frozen, a cold wind blowing. But it was also similar to the previous <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/11/bouldering-on-aland.html">bouldering trip to Åland</a> and this visit: The people were fantastic and made the trip even more memorable. Which made me realize once more: It’s more beautiful to share an outdoor adventure with friends. Sure it is nice to watch the sun set over the sea, but it is more fun to share that moment with a good friend. It’s cool if you topped out on your route, but it’s cooler if you have a friend to high-five with to celebrate that success. And while Sauna is always great, also on your own, it’s much better with friends who share your passion for a good <em>löyly</em>. So when you head out on your next outdoor adventure, take someone along: Your partner, kids, mate or someone who shares the same love for the outdoors than you do. I’m certain the trip will be more fun &amp; memorable for both of you =) </p>

<p>So much for advice, here’s a couple of B-Roll photos and one-liners to wet your appetite to head over to Åland with a bike and Crashpad on your back.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28810986921/in/album-72157672041470976/" title="On the way onto the ferry"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8701/28810986921_d281162f39_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1200" alt="On the way onto the ferry" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Kathrin from <a href="http://luminoucity.net">Luminoucity</a>, Kristof and me rolling onto the ferry by bike. My first time to roll on a bike onto a ferry, and a good one. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28810987461/in/album-72157672041470976/" title="Good Bye Helsinki"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8424/28810987461_9fe00bcb5c_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1200" alt="Good Bye Helsinki" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We said Good-By to Helsinki on the sun deck, sans sun.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28269451094/in/album-72157672041470976/" title="Morning cycling through along the fields"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7783/28269451094_8364170fbc_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Morning cycling through along the fields" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>At dawn we arrived on Åland and started to cycle up north to <a href="http://www.havsvidden.com">HavsVidden</a> past golden fields and a rising sun. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28810986491/in/album-72157672041470976/" title="Kristof at Kasviken"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7730/28810986491_0b29a9ae18_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1069" alt="Kristof at Kasviken" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We slipped in a session at Kasviken as it was so conveniently on the way. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28810986241/in/album-72157672041470976/" title="Relaxing at HavsVidden"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8846/28810986241_95f636f677_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1069" alt="Relaxing at HavsVidden" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>After that it was pretty chill at the beach house. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="http://amzn.to/2beNxGI" title="The Best We Can Do Is Nothing"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8160/28798090366_542e2ab604_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1069" alt="The Best We Can Do Is Nothing" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I read an <a href="http://amzn.to/2beNxGI">inspiring book</a> the next morning, which motivated me to do… nothing.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28798090286/in/album-72157672041470976/" title="Relaxing at Fågelberget"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8269/28798090286_a9f93a9c13_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1200" alt="Relaxing at Fågelberget" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>In between bouts of work I succeeded in following the books advice.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28855542636/in/album-72157672041470976/" title="Stallhagen Beers are tasty!"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8646/28855542636_ea16422b1f_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Stallhagen Beers are tasty!" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Then I failed pretty badly by cycling close to 46 km to go eat at <a href="http://www.stallhagen.com/en/?ageok=yes">Stallhagen</a>, and yes, drink some of their fantastic beers. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28855541356/in/album-72157672041470976/" title="Pelago Bicycles Capri"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8895/28855541356_f75340ee58_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Pelago Bicycles Capri" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>My friends were very happy with their <a href="https://www.pelagobicycles.com">Pelago Bicycles</a>, here the pretty <a href="https://www.pelagobicycles.com/bicycles/capri.html">Capri</a> which Vera rode.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28810989711/in/album-72157672041470976/" title="Portrait Sessions"><img src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8776/28810989711_fe8e83bd40_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Portrait Sessions" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I myself had my much loved <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/11/pelago-bicycles-stavanger.html">Stavanger</a> along, which performed flawlessly once again. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28810989151/in/album-72157672041470976/" title="On the way back to Mariehamn from Kobba Klintar"><img src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8695/28810989151_1951188c9e_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1200" alt="On the way back to Mariehamn from Kobba Klintar" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Jonas from <a href="http://www.paddelboden.com">The Paddle Shack</a> took us out to Kobba Klintar, the old pilot station which is really a great destination for a day of paddling. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28798090336/in/album-72157672041470976/" title="Seakayaking with Paddelboden"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8895/28798090336_ebc0d4057a_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1069" alt="Seakayaking with Paddelboden" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>On the way back we had back wind and choppy seas, so it was nice when we weaved back into the Archipelago and let ourselves just drift in the wind back towards the shack. Then it was just about cycling back to the ferry harbour and waiting for our big boat back to Helsinki. It was once again a fantastic visit and I can highly recommend you to spend a week or more on Åland if you’re into any of the above activities. And I’ll let you know where to read the good story and see the proper photos when it’s out!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A new approach to OutDoor News posts this year, with a look at different categories instead of brands. Starting of with everyone’s favourite: Stoves!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28273014340/in/dateposted/" title="Fjällräven"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8566/28273014340_deff01d426_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Fjällräven" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I didn’t find too many new stoves this year, which I blame on my severely limited time at the show to walk around and visit the different booths. But at least I managed to see and play with two stoves on the fair, of which I found the <strong>Jetboil MightyMo</strong> the more interesting one. At 95 g it certainly isn’t the lightest stove around, especially if you factor in an additional windscreen and pot, but if we look at the stove only we see it is actually a pretty powerful little thing. It packs 10.000 BTU which is around 3.000 Watt in case these matters to you, in practice it means you can boil water &amp; melt snow at high altitude - although the reliable regulator is more responsible for that. It has a Piezo ignition which is comfortable and nice in use, and the output can be finely adjusted allowing you to simmer, cook or just boil. It is compatible with the <a href="http://bit.ly/2at9tLU">Jetboil FluxRing pans</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/2aqgAXf">pots</a> which have heat exchangers and works well with them. The MightyMo should retail in Europe for 59€ next year, while US Americans already will be able to buy it in the autumn.</p>

<p>The <strong>MSR PocketRocket 2</strong> combines the MicroRocket’s light weight with the durability and quick boil time of the PocketRocket and also is more compact and stable as its predecessor. It is now 73 g light, 20% smaller as the original and boils one litre of water in 3,5 minutes. The new pot supports accommodate a wider range of pot sizes. No info on output, price and how reliable it would work at high altitude.</p>

<p>So much on stoves, lets stay with MSR and look at the new <strong>TrailShot Microfilter</strong>. Made for trailrunners &amp; hikers who do not want to carry much water on their runs &amp; hikes, this filter is a combination of a hose and filter. It’s pretty easy to use: Drop the hose into the water source - a stream in the mountains, a lake in the woods or even a puddle - and then squeeze the filter. The squeezing sucks water into the filter, and at the front, mouth piece clean &amp; filtered water comes out. The filter takes out Protozoa and bacteria, and weighs 142 g for the Filter &amp; Hose. The flow rate of 1 litre per minute is reasonably fast and you can treat up to 2.000 l of water with it. It should cost 50€ in Germany when it comes out next year.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28450556132/in/dateposted/" title="MSR TrailShot Microfilter"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8596/28450556132_1793a116b7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="MSR TrailShot Microfilter" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>In my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/07/outdoor-2016-first-gear-teasers.html">teaser post</a> I already looked at the <strong>Katadyn BeFree</strong> and it was cool to see one in action at the fair. It’s a nifty setup that weighs only 55 g including the 0,5 l Hydrapak Softflask. The filter is easy to clean and has a high output rate. The filter itself is good for 1.000 l of dirty water, then you can replace the filter unit for 35€ - given that the whole package is 45€ it’s a bit expensive for just the filter me thinks, but if your Softflask is still OK why replace it? Rumours on the show floor have it that there will be bigger flasks coming in 2017 as well as a possible system, but as the filter does already fit on bigger Hydrapak softflasks you could just use on of these already.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28557076125/in/photostream/" title="Katadyn BeFree"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8839/28557076125_e24b4950fe_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Katadyn BeFree" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Do you like to make pretty night time photos of your illuminated tent under the Milky Way? Read a book before you turn it? Need some light to search something in your tent at night? Then the <strong>Petzl Noctilight</strong> might be something for you. Put your Petzl Headlamp in there during transport or at camp, put it on and it will diffuse the light beautifully for reading, searching and taking photos. It’s 85 g heavy, so if you’re an ultralight backpacker you need to ponder hard if it comes along, but for glamping it will be a great little accessory.</p>

<p>The <em>HYBRID design allows Petzl’s new compact headlamps to run off both the CORE rechargeable battery or three AAA/LR03 batteries, without an adapter. A practical and flexible solution that allows the user to take advantage of each of these energy sources, depending on use. Compatible with all TIKKINA, TIKKA, ZIPKA, ACTIK, ACTIK CORE, TACTIKKA, TACTIKKA+ and TACTIKKA +RGB headlamps.</em> The CORE rechargeable battery weighs 23 g and can be recharged via the USB port of your headlamp or directly, as the CORE also has a mini USB port.</p>

<p>The <strong>Petzl eLite</strong> comes back, this time around with 50 Lumen at 27 g of weight. It keeps the red light, strobes, the whistle in the back and is still powered by two Lithium CR032 batteries. It now also has the red carrying case included again, and has a recommended retail price of 25€. </p>

<p>Other Petzl headlamps have got minor updates - you know the drill: More lumen, new colours. But the <strong>Actik and Actik Core Headlamps</strong> are actually new and aimed at active people, or to be more precise as everyone that walks around outside in the dark is active: Active people who need lots of light and go fast. The Actik packs 300 Lumen and is designed for mountaineering, running, hiking and backpacking at night. It has red light for keeping your night vision, and reflective details on the headband make you visible to others outside in the dark. It works with the CORE rechargeable battery, weighs 90 g and should cost only 40€! The big brother Actik Core packs 350 Lumen, weighs only 80 g and costs only 55€. The CORE battery is included, hence the Core in the name. </p>

<p>Another light and rechargeable headlamp is the <strong>Black Diamond Iota</strong>. The 56 g light (and that’s including batteries) headlamp packs 150 Lumen and is powered by an lithium ion rechargeable battery which is loaded in three hours via USB. The Iota also has the PowerTap Technology which allows you to fast and simply transition between full and dimmed power, and a 3-level power meter shows the remaining battery life for three seconds after you switch on the headlamp. </p>

<p>I’m a collapsible and Kuksa kind of man, but as I was strolling past the <strong>SIGG</strong> booth I was shang-haied in by a PR Person and informed about the new bottles from the Swiss company. So let me briefly tell you about them as well, alrighty? The <strong>Miracle Bottle</strong> on the far right (the blue one in case you don’t remember where right is) has a <em>revolutionary drinking cap that allows the desired amount of water to be released simply by pressing an ergonomic button</em>. Made of Tritan it holds 0,6 l of your favourite liquid. As stats such as weight and prize are often not of importance to PR people and I was in a hurry onwards and couldn’t be bothered to ask via Email we’ll need to find out next year when one of us buys it and weighs it. Lets ignore the green bottle next in line and move on to the grey-ish one, the <strong>Hero Bottle</strong>. It has a Tritan bottle neck and a polypropylene body that can be squeezed. It has also a 0,6 l volume, is Made in Germany and is easy to use with one hand, SIGG writes. Which brings us to the last bottle in the line-up on the left, the <strong>Total Clear Bottle</strong>. It is heat resistant and dishwasher safe, made in China from Tritan and has a SIGG Wide Mouth Bottle One Top lid which <em>allows you to fill up the bottle simply without having to remove the lid</em>. The volume is 0,75 l and it’s also possible to fill carbonated drinks in it. </p>

<p>The <strong>Roll Doc from Ortovox</strong> is an emergency kit which you can roll up. It packs compact when not needed and in case of an emergency you roll it open where it reveals five compartments with different First Aid supplies, from an emergency blanket to scissors and bandages. The Roll Doc weighs 190 g fully filled, is waterproof and has illustrations on the inside which help you figure out how to help your injured friend.</p>

<p>And finally a look at a new knife. The <strong>Morakniv Eldris</strong> is 76 g light for knife &amp; sheath (the knife itself is 60 g light) and lays beautifully in the hand. It’s gonna be available later in the autumn of this year, in five colours which show the general trend of colours for the next few years: More toned down &amp; earthy. This fixed blade does actually fit into your pocket and super versatile in use: Take it along hiking &amp; camping, use it as a safety knife when climbing or even take it hunting. The thermoplastic rubber on the handle ensures a safe grip of the little knife, which is 143 mm long in total. The blade is 56 mm long, which theoretically would even make it carry-on compliant, but I wouldn’t try that personally. You can use the back of the blade to strike a firesteel, and indeed the Eldris is available in a set with a lanyard and firesteel. I might do a more detailed review on this little friend in the future, as I already have one!</p>
