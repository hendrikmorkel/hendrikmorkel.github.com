    <id>http://hikinginfinland.com/2015/07/the-great-wide-open</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>The Great Wide Open</em> has the byline <em>New Outdoor and Landscape Photography</em>. If it is really new and if you should get a copy, you read in my review.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19968932345/in/dateposted/" title="The Great Wide Open"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/319/19968932345_8fc222df65_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="The Great Wide Open" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I like the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/gestalten-verlag/">Gestalten Verlag</a>. They make cool coffee table books with great photos and texts, so when <a href="http://shop.gestalten.com/great-wide-open.html">The Great Wide Open</a> appeared on my radar I was eager to check it out. An email and a few days later the heavy book slammed on my porch, ready to be browsed. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19780862558/in/dateposted/" title="The Great Wide Open"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3665/19780862558_72b216d413_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="The Great Wide Open" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>However, opening the book the euphoria quickly ended. Sure, there are very fine images in there, but just as much of them look like they’re shot on an iPhone for Instagram and not for a large coffee table book. It feels like every other photo is a grainy mess that looked great on your Instagram feed when seen on a smartphone but shouldn’t have been printed in such a large format. Speaking of Instagram, if you’re on it and follow some landscape photographers then you’ll have seen the vast majority of these images in one form or another already. Another disappointment was that you could clearly see in many images that they have been taken not far away from a road or civilization - given that the Prologue of the book refers to <a href="http://amzn.to/1SFXAis">Ansel Adams</a> and how he would set off on long expeditions to capture expansive, wild landscapes that feels a bit wrong. Oh, and if you don’t like Chris Burkard - don’t get the book. Half the images are from him, and while they’re technically very good I personally find them a bit boring. On ther other hand, if you love him - get the book!</p>

<p>But for all that there’s also some very great &amp; inspiring photos in the book. The pictures from Anki Grøthe, Kilian Schönberger, Jimmy Chin, Logan Watts and a few others are crisp, sharp and with a fresh perspective on the outdoors. Add in the small stories and anecdotes from the photographers, athletes and outdoor folks and you get a book that will inspire you at least for one afternoon. Well, maybe a couple more. And if you like Instagram photos and would love to see them in a big book, you’ll probably read it every day! So if you feel like you want to give The Great Wide Open a chance and browse it yourself then order it directly at <a href="http://shop.gestalten.com/great-wide-open.html">Gestalten</a> or <a href="http://amzn.to/1RXDe9B">Amazon.com</a>, <a href="http://amzn.to/1frJyEz">Amazon.co.uk</a> &amp; <a href="http://amzn.to/1frJFzT">Amazon.de</a>.</p>

    <id>http://hikinginfinland.com/2015/07/the-soa-jury-meeting</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.scandinavianoutdoorgroup.com/projects-activities/scandinavian-outdoor-award/">Scandinavian Outdoor Award</a> is the only Award for Outdoor Gear (<em>if compared to the ISPO Award, OutDoor Industry Award et al.</em>) which tests gear where it’s meant to be used - in the outdoors. I was honoured to be invited to this years Jury meeting in <a href="http://www.montafon.at/en">Montafon</a>, right after my Dolomites Tour and before the <a href="">2015 OutDoor</a>. Here’s an inside look at the Jury meeting and my thoughts on the kit I have tested.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19749486148/in/dateposted/" title="Back at camp"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/451/19749486148_57f3f5db4d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Back at camp" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="the-testing">The Testing</h2>

<p>The SOA exists since 2006 and I have been following it actively since around 2010/ 2011, always curious to see which new gear was being tested and awarded. As the name suggests, only companies who are located in Scandinavia - Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Iceland and Finland - can be a part of the group, and it’s also only their gear that gets tested. This year there were 19 Nominees from 13 brands, and the kit included amongst others four tents, three pair of shoes, two compasses and a pair of Undies =)</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19314886004/in/dateposted/" title="Group Photo half way up the mountain"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/349/19314886004_1752cc0f32_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Group Photo half way up the mountain" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The SOA Summer Jury 2015 came from from six countries and included esteemed Outdoor Journalists, Retailers, a Photographer - and for the first time ever an Outdoor Blogger =) Well, I obviously also <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/07/summer-writing-slash-reading.html">write for a few magazines</a> but Hiking in Finland remains the most-read Outdoor blog in Scandinavia, so it was cool to be along and bring some Blogger views to the Jury. </p>

<p>The gear testing was well done, some of us spent two days out with the kit in the mountains, which is more than any other Award does, but does not compare to my own testing (which takes months, if not years). After checking the gear out on Sunday evening and everyone got a few pieces to test we got up early at dawn on Monday and hiked for two hours to a hut, where we had breakfast. The weather was a mixed bag of rain and clouds which was in my opinion pretty good testing weather - so we could see about the waterproofness, breathability, grip and comfort in bad weather. After a great breakfast we headed further up the mountain and pitched the tents, after which it started to clear a bit. A short Via Ferrata hike, lunch and a stroll back to the gondola rounded out the afternoon for most, but five of us headed back up after dinner to sleep in the tents. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19937539195/in/dateposted/" title="Time to go to sleep"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/410/19937539195_1a9f138559_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Time to go to sleep" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Gijs from <a href="http://www.oppad.nl/">Oppad</a>, Karen from <a href="http://www.norrmagazin.de/">NORR</a>, Frank from <a href="http://www.outdoor-magazin.com/">Outdoor</a>, Piotr from <a href="http://www.goryonline.com/">Gory</a> and me slept up on the mountain in the four tents and enjoyed chatting by the fire and drinking a glass of red wine before turning in. The next morning we headed down to the valley with the first gondola and had the final Jury meeting, where we quickly were able to agree on the winners in the different categories. After that it was time to pack up and head to the OutDoor in Friedrichshafen, where the Gear Fest would start the next day.</p>

<p><em>Here’s a quick look at the gear I have tested during the SOA Jury meeting, much of it will first hit the stores in 2016 so have patience!</em></p>

<h2 id="lundhags-baalka">Lundhags Baalka</h2>

<p>This was the first <a href="http://lundhags.se/home-2/">Lundhags</a> trousers I have worn, and I liked the Baalka a lot. They were not too hot - especially as soon as we were above 2000 m where it was nice and cool, and stayed dry also in the small rain showers we had. It has stretchy Schoeller inserts and a Fluorcarbon-free DWR and is made from a Polyester &amp; Cotton material mix. On the sides are ventilation zippers and it was very stretchy so that the scrambles, running and Via Ferrata were no problem. It will be available in March 2016 and will cost 170€. I especially liked the colour, though the hand pockets could have been a bit deeper. </p>

<h2 id="rjk-primaloft-superundies">Röjk Primaloft SuperUndies</h2>

<p>Testing underwear is fun. I own a handful of <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/04/gear-outtakes-winter-2015.html">Icebreaker Anatomica Boxers</a> which I rate high, but given the lower price of around 30€ of the Primaloft SuperUndies, that they don’t move uop and feel drier I likely will buy the <a href="http://rojksuperwear.com/en/">Röjk</a> Primaloft SuperUndies when they come out in spring/ summer 2016. I wore these for 24+ hours during the Jury meeting and they didn’t smell either, so for me a strong contender for outdoor underwear.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19753546238/in/dateposted/" title="Röjk Primaloft SuperUndies"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/442/19753546238_f0462e28c9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Röjk Primaloft SuperUndies" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="klttermusen-fjorgyn-anorak">Klättermusen Fjorgyn Anorak</h2>

<p>I also was lucky enough to wear the <a href="http://www.klattermusen.com/">Klättermusen</a> Fjorgyn Anorak. There were two other jackets in for test but this was the only one that everyone was excited about - for a good reason, it’s the first time Klättermusen launches a Summer line, and the Fjorgyn Anorak is a good fitting and great looking shell layer. Made from a 48 g/ m² 2,5 layer fabric with a carbon print on the inside it feels very comfy on the skin, even if you’re just wearing a T-Shirt. I liked the drawstring which sat in the middle of the buttocks and so created a sort of flap where rain could run off and not straight to your pants. The Neoprene brim protected the face well and the hood had a good fit. A fine anorak, and at 202 g in Size M even lightweight!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19937538415/in/album-72157653909966154/" title="Selfie in the new Klättermusen Fjorgyn Jacket"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/548/19937538415_2cf95d3d3a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Selfie in the new Klättermusen Fjorgyn Jacket" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="viking-apex-ii-gtx">Viking Apex II GTX</h2>

<p>The Apex II GTX from <a href="http://www.vikingfootwear.com/">Viking</a> were a good fit for me, had great grip on any surface I threw at them and were pretty comfortable. However, the Boa Closure System blew open on each shoe once during the day, once while trail running, which isn’t very nice. The Coolmax/ Merino material didn’t seem to make any difference in the wet weather we had, and the Gore-Tex lining didn’t do it’s job well - a good thing that I’m used to hiking in wet shoes. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19942661841/in/dateposted/" title="Viking Apex II GTX"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/270/19942661841_f193876b71_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Viking Apex II GTX" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="hilleberg-niak">Hilleberg Niak</h2>

<p>I pitched the <a href="http://europe.hilleberg.com/EN/index.php">Hilleberg</a> Niak and saw that it was large enough to sleep two - and that’s what we then did in the night. The Niak is claimed to be a 1,5 Person tent, but rest assured that two adults + gear fit without problem in this ~ 1,6 kg tent. It was very easy to put up and pack, has the possibility to roll up both flysheet doors for fine views, is equipped with a large inner door and has all the attention to detail you’d expect from a Hilleberg tent - sadly this also includes the rather hefty price tag of 890 €.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19749485238/in/dateposted/" title="Closed"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3733/19749485238_e2d13efb07_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Closed" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>It was a great three days and I really enjoyed being able to test the kit and help decide on worthy winners. Most of all it was great to spend time with so many passionate gear nerds and hear their views on the kit, see and learn how they test and come together to conclusions. It showed me that the Scandinavian Outdoor Award is rightfully well regarded amongst consumers &amp; retailers - because all Jury members take their job serious. We for example didn’t award a Sustainability Award because we felt that while all entries had made a good effort, from an Award winner we expect even more! Finally, also Montafon looked like a fine region for hiking, climbing and snowboarding/ skiing, so I might need to plan a trip back there with some more time =)</p>

<p>For the digital Mountain Pro Magazine I interview the BMG Mountain Guide <a href="http://www.mountainpromag.com/imag/mountainprojuly2015/files/34.html">Tim Blakemore</a> whom I met last year at the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/07/arcteryx-alpine-academy-2014.html">Arc’teryx Alpine Academy</a>. It’s a nice story that looks at the work of a Mountain Guide and fits well in with the Alpine topic of the issue, where also Jon Griffith, <a href="http://www.alexroddie.com/index.html">Alex Roddie</a> and many others have contributed fascinating stories. <a href="http://www.mountainpromag.com/imag/mountainprojuly2015/">Available for free online</a>.</p>

<h2 id="trekking-magazin">trekking Magazin</h2>

<p>For the trekking Magazin I reviewed my favourite summer shirts and wrote a reportage about packrafting and how it opens up new possibilities for backpackers and trekkers. It’s a fine looking article with lots of infos on four different packrafts I have tested and a variety of packrafting gear.

    <id>http://hikinginfinland.com/2015/07/via-dinarica-day-1</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What makes the Via Dinarica <em>The best trail of 2014</em>? Is it the idea of connecting seven countries via humanities simplest activity, walking? Or something else? Reason enough for me to pack my backpack, book a flight to Sarajevo and investigate.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19297808236" title="Almost there by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/393/19297808236_97eaf58052_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Almost there" /></a></p>

<p><em>“What are your expectations of this trip?”</em> Tim asked me after he picked me up at the airport in Sarajevo. <em>“Well”</em>, I started, <em>“I don’t have any. I never expect anything when I go on a research trip, and let the region show me what it has to offer. It’s only fair and more adventurous, too.”</em>  But Bosnia and Herzegovina has impressed me, very positively. It’s a beautiful country with warm, welcoming people, delicious food, and the views are quite decent, too. In the following series of trip reports I’ll walk you through the Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina part of the Via Dinarica Trail, and will answer questions in the final post where I also will give more information on the trail.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19136258770" title="Sarajevo by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3666/19136258770_cc1244bbdd_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Sarajevo" /></a></p>

<h2 id="sarajevo">Sarajevo</h2>

<p><em>“Coffee?”</em> Sure. As an European Finn I seldom say no to coffee, and the coffee in Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina is superb, especially when brewed in the traditional way. Besides, I was up since 4 am and already had three different flights so something to keep me awake in the sweltering heat of this bustling city was always welcome. We had good coffee and then a stroll through the old part of Sarajevo, which was gorgeous with small, narrow streets lined with stalls, open air Cafés, Restaurants where delicious smells wafted from the open windows, and lots of people. Mosques stood next to Churches, and the peaceful co-existence of the religions in this country is certainly something the world could learn. </p>

<p>Later in the afternoon I meet the rest of the Terra Dinarica team, Olja, Stefan and Kenan, who would be my Guide over the next five days. We had a tasty dinner high above Sarajevo, before Kenan dropped me off at my Hostel for the night. <em>“Pick up is at 5 am”</em> he said with a smile, and so I turned in after a quick shower to get some sleep before the Alarm would wake me up yet again so early.</p>

<h2 id="risovac-to-diva-grabovica">Risovac to Diva Grabovica</h2>

<p>This 27,6 km section started at a ski slope a couple of hours drive south west of Sarajevo. Already on the way there we passed with the car scenery which would make any backpacker and climber very happy indeed, with a <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18703305363/in/album-72157650519579023/">Mini El Cap</a> and lush, green valleys which would make for fine hiking. Here at the Risovac ski centre Kenan and me shoulder our backpacks, said bye to Tim who’d meet us at the other side, and set off.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18703269283" title="At the start by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/516/18703269283_e92f6c0d92_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="At the start" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19327844291" title="Through the forest by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/428/19327844291_1d0a97d467_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Through the forest" /></a></p>

<p>We quickly reach the top of the ski slope and turned into the forest, where patches of snow still lined the trail. It didn’t take us long to be so high that the trail was under the snow, and I was pondering if my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/05/arcteryx-acrux2-fl-gtx.html">Arc’teryx Acrux² FL GTX</a> shoes would be up to the task (They were, and great on the snow indeed). Where the trail skirts the mountain on the south/ west side, the snow was happily gone, but also walking on the snow was fine - it was still fairly compact with just a thin, mushy layer on top which gave good grip.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19327855101" title="Trailmarker by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3919/19327855101_aa9c6a7a5e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Trailmarker" /></a></p>

<p>The weather was great - so warm that I quickly shed layers and hiked in my T-Shirt. Kenan tells me about the mountain we traverse, the sights, where the Via Dinarica passes here and local lore. He’s also a good model and doesn’t protest when I let him walk several sections twice to get the right shot, but even with all the chatting and taking photos we make good speed and soon see the summit we’re aiming for today, the Great Vilinac Summit. The trail towards it sneaks through patches of low-growing shrubbery, and spring crocuses are piercing their white and violet heads already through the ground there where the snow has melted.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18703292873" title="Snow &amp; Green by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/381/18703292873_43f737a76c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Snow &amp; Green" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18701483194" title="Under the snow by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/494/18701483194_990870e0c0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Under the snow" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19136404998" title="Summit by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3750/19136404998_9fbf454c9f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Summit" /></a></p>

<p>The summit is snow-free and after signing the summit book we sit and have a drink. The view is fantastic and we’re lucky with the weather. But we arranged to have lunch at a mountain hut a bit further along the trail, and so we soon shoulder our light packs again and head onwards to the Tise Mountain Hut. It’s a bit off the trail and we descent for ten minutes, but already from a distance it looks like it is closed. As we stand in front of the locked doors we’re certain that we won’t be eating lunch here, a good thing we have some snacks with us and that the bench and table have a scenic view to enjoy. We go for a look to find the water spring nearby, but it is still buried under a meter of snow, and so we just continue.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18703352493" title="Mountain Hut by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/456/18703352493_0e1322e538_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Mountain Hut" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17482621798" title="Lunch with a view by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5455/17482621798_55e05af41e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Lunch with a view" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18703354393" title="Voda?! by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/414/18703354393_4dc5ba09e2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Voda?!" /></a></p>

<p>We follow the trailmarkers - a red circle with a white dot in the middle - for a while, until we’re back on the snow. While it allows us to make short-cuts it’s also a bit more strenuous to walk on it, and of course it also soaks your shoes and socks. But it’s warm &amp; sunny, so not a problem, merely a slight inconvenience. We’re high up and descent and ascend just a little for several kilometres, until it is time for the big 1.600 m descent to the Diva Grabovica valley. The views which open up before us are breath-taking, but you have to stop to enjoy then, as the descent is steep on a trail which is often just a mere foot wide, if it’s not entirely covered under the snow.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19323948775" title="Trailmarker with a view by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/314/19323948775_27ed95b999_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Trailmarker with a view" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18703316503" title="Spring snow by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/334/18703316503_2ff0aeff59_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Spring snow" /></a>

<p>Ahead of us we also can see Prenj, the mountain range we will be traversing in the next two days. Soon enough we reach the tree line and lush green beech trees with fresh, young leaves make the walking in the warm weather more pleasant. From afar we already saw a rustic cabin - the former Kings Hunting Cabin - and we made a little detour to visit it. It was pretty from the outside, with wooden shingles on the face of the building, but the inside was mouldy, dark and not welcoming. Also the garbage which was left wasn’t a nice sight, and so we continued further down. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19317902182" title="Taking in the view by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3691/19317902182_a3020d88a6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Taking in the view" /></a>

<p>We heard voices already further up the mountain, and as we happened on the 2nd hut - which was in much better shape - we meet Tim and friends of Kenan, who did a <a href="http://planinarenje.ba/planinarske-ture/cvrsnica/712-zli-potok-tise-zlijeb-9-5-2015#!">Via Ferrata Route</a> (scroll down to see their photos!) and were now also on the way back down. We decided to go check out the Look out point and have a cup of coffee all together, and it was a nice place to rest and drink some good Bosnian coffee. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18703362883" title="Side view by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/477/18703362883_0b88684653_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Side view" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19327915261" title="Sunstar by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/523/19327915261_d88f5b2a36_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Sunstar" /></a>

<p>On the way to the valley the trail soon became a gorgeous green tunnel which smelled so wonderful, it was unbelievable. Colourful flowers, buzzing insects, colourful butterflies and bubbling wells we found the further we descended the trail, and as we finally broke out of the dense green forest a magnificent panorama opened up before us. A colourful little meadow stood in full flowers, while the sun was hiding behind big, dramatic grey clouds, throwing a few rays on the mountains we just left behind. It was such a perfect place that I’d loved to have put my tarp up right there, but we still had a few hundred meters to descent and move onwards, so we left the meadow behind and hiked on.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18701473974" title="Well by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/423/18701473974_a7f5e49cfb_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Well" /></a>

<p>At the car we threw our packs into the car and drove towards the next Restaurant, where we enjoyed a dinner of lamb and a local beer before Tim brought us to Prenj. It was night as we arrived the start of the trail, and after a quick repack for the next two days we set off. I was completely destroyed as we started to hike, but pushed on. While I was planning to sleep in my bivy outside instead of the Medjuprenje Mountain Hut where we were headed, after I saw a few Scorpions on the trail and Kenan told me about the Black Widows Spiders which can be encountered here I decided that the hut it would be. It was close to 23 o’clock as we stumbled into the Medjuprenje Mountain Hut, where other friends of Kenan right away offered us a Rakija, and after a zip of this tasty fruit brandy I headed up to roll out my quilt and call it a night. <strong>To be continued.</strong></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://bit.ly/1BQVH0i">Kelly Cordes - The Tower</a> is a gripping book about the history of climbing on Cerro Torre. If you’re in love with Patagonia, it’s mountaineering history, and the Chalten massiv, read on to hear my verdict on this book.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19165133102" title="Kelly Cordes - The Tower by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/302/19165133102_bd1146bf09_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Kelly Cordes - The Tower" /></a></p>

<p><em>Oh Patagonia, how I long to see thee!</em> As <a href="http://bit.ly/1BR9bcu">Patagonia Books</a> asked me if I’d like to read Kelly Cordes new book about Cerro Torre, my answer was of course <em>Yes!</em> How would one who likes to climb and loves the mountains not read the book about one of the most beautiful mountains on this planet? Also history enthusiasts will enjoy this fine book, which is written in such a way that also non-climbers will find it fascinating and read chapter after chapter.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Climbing is not a democracy. It never has been. That’s one of the things we love about it. Climbing is about freedom, and just as Maestri scarred Cerro Torre when he put in all those bolt ladders, Jason and I removed about 120 of his bolts on our descent.”</em> - Hayden Kennedy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a nutshell the book chronicles the history of climbing on Cerro Torre and the controversy surrounding the claimed first ascent in 1959 and the 1970 Compressor Route of Cesare Maestri, an Italian climber who became world-famous because of these two routes. The book has four distinct parts, divided into 35 chapters on 400 pages. Cordes tries on these pages to uncover the truth about the claimed First Ascent in 1959 &amp; the death of Toni Egger, who died under unknown circumstances on the claimed descent. Cordes interviews supporters and opponents of Maestri, talks with Reinhold Messner, and many of the Alpinists which have climbed new routes on Cerro Torre. In the end he draws logical conclusions, but lets you, the reader, come to your own results. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19170902365" title="Kelly Cordes - The Tower by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/318/19170902365_ed1f2005d3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Kelly Cordes - The Tower" /></a></p>

<p>On the side he also looks at how modern technology and tourism has changed the landscape in El Chalten, the removal of 120 of Maestri’s bolts and the ensuing discussion, and then gives you in three Appendixes a Timeline of Cerro Torre Ascents, the people mentioned and a climbing glossary, as well as maps and a selected bibliography. It’s a well rounded book with gorgeous photos and will inspire many to climb in Patagonia, or at least visit the area and hike underneath these stunning peaks. If you’re an Alpinist, climber, mountaineer or just barely interested in mountains and Cerro Torre then you should read this book. It’s an enthralling read and you’ll fly through the chapters, eager to learn more about the history and climbing on this beautiful mountain &amp; it’s difficult history. You can order the book directly from <a href="http://bit.ly/1BQVH0i">Patagonia</a> or <a href="http://amzn.to/1GBoCAZ">Amazon.com</a>, <a href="http://amzn.to/1Jngv26">Amazon.co.uk</a> and <a href="http://amzn.to/1Cy6NlF">Amazon.de</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2011/04/julbo-dolgan-sunglasses.html">Julbo Dolgan Sunglasses</a> started to arrive at the end of their life-cycle, so I was looking around for a new pair that’s suitable for hiking, mountaineering and cycling alike. I settled on the <a href="http://www.unterwegs.biz/en/julbo-trek-503333.html?farbe=schwarz%2Fgrün">Julbo Trek</a> shades with Zebra lenses, and after using them for several months &amp; on five trips it’s time for a review.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18954779610" title="Julbo Trek underneath Otiš and Zelena Glava in Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/499/18954779610_18fc8a33e4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Julbo Trek underneath Otiš and Zelena Glava in Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina" /></a></p>

<p>I like sunglasses and wear a pair almost all the time, be it for cycling, walking through town, mountaineering or ice climbing, if I’m outside I 8 out of 10 times am having a pair of shades on my nose. The <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2011/04/julbo-dolgan-sunglasses.html">Julbo Dolgan Sunglasses</a> I own have seen over five years of use and countless trips, and it started to be time to pick up a new pair. The Golgan were great, but I wanted something with lighter lenses that’s more suitable for cycling in spring and autumn, when the main reason to wear glasses for me is to keep rain, dirt and bugs out of my eyes. After some research I settled on the <a href="http://www.unterwegs.biz/en/julbo-trek-503333.html?farbe=schwarz%2Fgrün">Julbo Trek Sunglasses with Zebra lenses</a>, and <a href="http://www.unterwegs.biz/en/">Unterwegs.biz</a> was friendly enough to send me a pair for review.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18954780390" title="Julbo Trek Zebra Front by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/526/18954780390_c17b747d74_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Julbo Trek Zebra Front" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19116318046" title="Julbo Trek Zebra Top by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/292/19116318046_f37bc7d342_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Julbo Trek Zebra Top" /></a></p>

<p>The Trek with Zebra lenses are a multifunctional pair of shades and fulfill all my needs. I have worn them backpacking in Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, packrafting in Austria, paragliding in Italy, cycling at home and <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/06/arcteryx-alpine-academy-chamonix-2015.html">mountaineering in France</a>, and have worn them almost daily since they arrived here four months ago. The pair with all parts attached weighs 45 g with the weight being broken down like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>32 g Julbo Trek sunglasses</li>
  <li>04 g Sweat Blocker</li>
  <li>03 g Side pieces (two)</li>
  <li>06 g Headband</li>
</ul>

<p>That makes the Trek shades slightly heavier as the Dolgan, but I like the added protection of the larger glasses, the Sweat Blocker and the headband, which keeps the Trek securely on my head and of course the better lenses in my opinion. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18954781430" title="Julbo Trek Zebra Headband by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/265/18954781430_c01d0d9168_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Julbo Trek Zebra Headband" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18956356919" title="Julbo Trek Zebra Frontside with pieces detached by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/285/18956356919_de384df2ea_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Julbo Trek Zebra Frontside with pieces detached" /></a></p>

<p>It’s not all great, though: The foam on the Sweat Blocker piece which you can attach to the top of the glasses started to come off after just a couple of weeks of use, which I find poor design. It also helps to trap more heat and lets the glasses fog up more easily. It also doesn’t stop all sweat, but then I can excuse that as hiking in 30°C temperatures for 30 km with over 2.000 m ascent is a sweaty business and sweat running down your brow an expected outcome. I hope Julbo will look into this, I find it not really acceptable for this to happen.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18956355149" title="Julbo Trek Zebra Back by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/527/18956355149_af67415ef4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Julbo Trek Zebra Back" /></a></p>

<p>After the foam started to come lose I took the Sweat Blocker part off, and it has been good thus far. Either I have started to sweat less or just haven’t hiked in 30°C weather, but I had no sweat yet run into my eyes. Also the foggin up problems has been solved, which I blame on the improved ventilation. The side parts, which are also removable and are easily clipped on and off, are good to keep side glares away and headwind/ side wind out. The big thing about these sunglasses are obviously the lenses, and you pay 50€ extra for them over the standard Spectron 4 lenses (which I have on the Dolgan). Here’s what Julbo says about the Zebra lenses:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The Zebra® photochromic lens darkens or lightens depending on the light’s intensity. It can change from a light transmission rate of 42% to just 7%! Its anti-fog coating, directly integrated via laser, guarantees maximum efficiency and long life. Zebra® is recommended for mountain biking, trail biking, running, climbing, skiing, riding and other outdoor sports.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18954782190" title="Julbo Trek Zebra Frontside by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/257/18954782190_d43e043fce_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Julbo Trek Zebra Frontside" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18956354569" title="Julbo Trek Zebra inside by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/428/18956354569_21df201b4a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Julbo Trek Zebra inside" /></a></p>

<p>The lenses are lighter in terms of opacity than the Dolgan, and that’s something I value in traffic &amp; cycling, especially in spring when dusk comes earlier than now and darker lenses like the Spectron 4 make driving safely more difficult, especially if it’s also raining. In bright weather, like high in the mountains and on summer days, the Zebra lenses darken enough to make bright conditions less stressful on the eyes. I found the lighter Zebra lenses also comfortable on snow &amp; ice and found they block glare just as well as darker lenses, and they made seeing details in snow &amp; ice no problem. Fogging up has been only a problem with the Sweat Blocker on the shades, without it the ventilation is superb and even when running up a hill in 20°C sunshine &amp; running hot I didn’t get the shades to fog up. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18954777480" title="Julbo Trek with Zebra Lenses after cycling up to Heuberg, Kaiserwinkl by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/303/18954777480_21f699d1ec_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Julbo Trek with Zebra Lenses after cycling up to Heuberg, Kaiserwinkl" /></a></p>

<p>The fit of the Trek is on the larger side for my head, and hence I find the headband necessary to keep the shades securely on my head. They fit well under my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/petzl-sirocco-helmet.html">Sirocco Helmet</a> with a thin beanie underneath it, and also on their own make for a good fit. At the beginning the nose piece was slightly uncomfortable after several hours of wearing them, but that was just a question of getting used to them and nowadays I can wear them for 8 hours straight without needing to take them off. They do look big if you hold them in your hands, but I find they fit my rather slim face well &amp; then don’t look big anymore and are much smaller than e.g. Oakley shades I own. The Trek come with a soft bag which doubles as a cleaning wipe and a hard protective case. I haven’t used the protective case yet as I find it too bulky for transport on the trail, but the soft bag is all the time along when I’m out with the Trek on my nose. </p>

<p><strong>In conclussion</strong> I can say that I can recommend the Julbo Trek Sunglasses with Zebra lenses. They fit me well, work great for all activities I do - from hiking over cycling to mountaineering - and are protecting my eyes well from the sun, glare, rain and dirt. I like that they’re adaptable and that I can take off the extra side pieces and Sweat Blocker, though I’d wish that the latter would be better constructed. The lenses adapt well to different light situations and the headband ensures a secure fit, be it under a helmet or over a beanie. At 135€ they’re not the cheapest pair, but I recognice that I’ll be using them for the next five years at least very actively so I think they’re worth it.</p>

<p><em>By the way, a thing I really like from Unterwegs.biz is that they pay attention to the size of shipping packages. I always wince if I get a large package just to find a carabiner and a boxershorts in it, it feels like a massive waste of space &amp; generates more emissions and costs. Unterwegs.biz always seems to send gear in the smallest package possible, which I value highly from an environmental point of view.</em></p>

    <id>http://hikinginfinland.com/2015/06/zlagboard-pro-review</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/outdoor-2014-wrap-up-and-conclusions.html">OutDoor</a> last year I stumbled on the <a href="https://zlagboard.com/">Zlagboard</a> for the first time and immediately thought it’s an awesome way to train at home. The Zlagboard comes with a Smartphone App and training plans for every level, which allows you to track your progress over months. I have been training with the <a href="https://zlagboard.com/zlagboard-pro">Zlagboard Pro</a> since February and this is my review of it. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18490892773" title="Start Screen II by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/468/18490892773_d873e8b60c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Start Screen II" /></a></p>

<p>As a father &amp; entrepreneur it’s right now not as easy for me to go to the gym or outdoors for a round of climbing, but I feel bad if I can’t go. I’ve had a pair of <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/metolius-rock-rings-3d-trainingsgriffe/">Metolius Rock Rings</a> for several years but wanted something more - something that allows me to track my training, measure progress, set goals and let me get strong. Enter the Zlagboard and the great App. I’ll look at these two components and then the training with both.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19085360396" title="Workout Plans by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/388/19085360396_4af11ce9fd_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Workout Plans" /></a></p>

<h2 id="the-zlagboard-app">The Zlagboard App</h2>

<p>The Zlagboard <a href="https://zlagboard.com/app">App</a> (available on iOS and Android) is the digital part of your training. Modern smartphones like the iPhone come with a lot of sensors, and the physical Zlagboard in combination with the App make use of these sensors to measure your training. On the Start Screen you probably first want to set up your Profile and then head to the Store to activate your Zlagboard - you’ll find the code on the back of the Zlagboard to do so, and it’s good for five users. In the Store you also can purchase additional training plans, for example from <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/06/gimme-kraft.html">GimmeKraft!</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19104282642" title="Training Plans for Purchase in the Zlagboard Store by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3886/19104282642_674d3f4bb5_c.jpg" width="451" height="800" alt="Training Plans for Purchase in the Zlagboard Store" /></a><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18922333978" title="Trainings Overview Screen by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/368/18922333978_b38447bf2d_c.jpg" width="451" height="800" alt="Trainings Overview Screen" /></a></p>

<p>Once activated I did the Test which recommends you which Training Plan to follow, but I decided I start at the lowest Level and went with the Basic (free) Plan. The four Training Plans that are shown were developed by <a href="http://patxiusobiaga.com">Patxi Usobiaga</a> and all run 12 weeks. You’re not bound to stick to the scheduled days, but it of course would make sense to do so for the best training effect. And if you miss your Wednesday training you can just do it on Thursday.</p>

<p>I found the App well structured but missed some more instructions on some exercises, if not in the App at least on the website. This would have made it more beginner-friendly, as likely not every climber knows e.g. what’s the Full-Lock position. I think the prices for the Pro Plans are very fair and everything else in the App was very well designed. It worked without flaws on my old iPhone 5 (running iOS 8) and also should work well on any Android phone.</p>

<h2 id="the-zlagboard-pro-fingerboard">The Zlagboard Pro Fingerboard</h2>

<p>Fingerboard, hangboard, trainingboard - there’s many different names for this, but they essentially all mean the same. It’s a board made of wood or plastic with different sized finger holds for training at home. What’s different about the Zlagboard is that it’s a mounted on a separate frame - it is made of two (three if you count the steel) parts. The Nilo is attached to the wall and allows you to mount the Zlagboard Pro or <a href="https://zlagboard.com/zlagboard-vario">Vario</a> to it, and you could even mount several Nilo boards in your house and then just move the fingerboards around to use them. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19105859642" title="Side view by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/437/19105859642_12f9a67d68_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Side view" /></a></p>

<p>The actual fingerboard is mounted on a steel frame, and so when you hang on the board the steel frame stays in place but the wooden part moves softly a centimetre down. It’s super stable (unless you mounted it sloppily!) and makes for a good feeling when training. The board self is made of Alder wood and weighs 7 kg, with a size of 70 x 16 x 6 cm. It has 24 different holds in 10 pairs with four holds in the centre. There’s two Jugs, one 10° Sloper and two 35° Slopers, and many Crimps &amp; Pockets with a depth from 10 to 45 mm. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19085367456" title="Holds by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/437/19085367456_46d305b056_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Holds" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18923826010" title="Smartphone Mount by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/416/18923826010_7ecc16bee5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Smartphone Mount" /></a></p>

<p>Your smartphone is attached via the <a href="https://zlagboard.com/additional-equipment#smartphone-mount">Smartphone Mount</a>, which is an elastic gadget that attaches over the four corners of your phone and then you can slide it easily over the top metal part, so that you always easily can see what’s to be done next. These also can be bought separately and in different colours, in case you tend to missplace such things.</p>

<p>Besides the Zlagboard Pro which you see in my photos there’s also a <a href="https://zlagboard.com/zlagboard-mini">Zlagboard Mini</a> and a <a href="https://zlagboard.com/zlagboard-vario">Zlagboard Vario</a>. The former is, as the name suggests, smaller and optimized for GimmeKraft! workouts, while the latter allows you to attach a <a href="http://bit.ly/1LB72By">fingerboard</a> of your choice on it, be it a <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/beastmaker-2000-series-trainingsboard/">Beastmaker 2000</a> or <a href="http://bit.ly/1GHpW8s">Metolius Wood Grips Compact Training Board</a>, you can attach almost any board to it and then create custom workouts for it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18923837050" title="Hang-time by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/483/18923837050_0a8c1fd32b_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Hang-time" /></a></p>

<h2 id="training">Training</h2>

<p>Now that you know about the soft- and hardware, it is time to look at the training. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19111537695" title="Day 10 Trainings Plan by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/473/19111537695_63664516c6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Day 10 Trainings Plan" /></a></p>

<p>I choose the Basic Training Plan for starters and found it a good 50 minute workout three times a week. It’s organized in such a way that you first build up strength over the first month, in the 2nd month strength &amp; endurance and in the 3rd month you go for power. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19114895991" title="Break by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/312/19114895991_c041ac4566_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Break" /></a></p>

<p>In between exercises the App counts down your break time, tells you what’s next and also allows you to skip the break or pause the exercise if you gotta interrupt it. There’s a varied mix of exercises that makes use of increasingly difficult holds, for longer times, in more difficult positions. Pull-ups on the jugs are a good warm-up, and you can configure the App so that it either automatically counts them or that you need to touch the screen with your nose, as I so stylish demonstrate underneath. The breaks between exercises can go from 7 seconds to 5 minutes, which means you could read a book or answer some emails in between exercises - or just skip the breaks and continue in one go! </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18490903563" title="Touch the screen by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3678/18490903563_c7608b07c8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="845" alt="Touch the screen" /></a></p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>If you can not get to the climbing gym or crag as often as you would like to or are tired of your non-interactive fingerboard, then you’ll love the Zlagboard. For me it is one of the best innovations in the climbing market in the last years and allows me to train efficiently at home, with professionally developed training plans, and it tracks my progress so that I can measure my results. The wooden fingerboard is very well made and the App easy &amp; intuitively to use. The training plans are fun and get increasingly difficult, helping to build up strength and techniques for real-world projects - like my trip to the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/03/the-dolomites-rock-climbs-and-via-ferrata.html">Dolomites</a> next week. For me the Zlagboard is a great tool and I often just do a few pull-ups or hangs on it when standing in front of the computer gets too much. I really rate it very high and would recommend it to everyone who’d like to train at home with professional training plans &amp; measure the progress.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the 2015 <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/06/arcteryx-alpine-academy-chamonix-2015.html">Arc’teryx Alpine Academy</a> I got a sneak peek at the new Arc’teryx Acrux AR Alpine Boot, the first alpine climbing boot from Arc’teryx. I was lucky enough to try it on and play around with it in Chamonix, and also take a look at the two new Approach and Crag shoes, the Acrux SL and Arakys. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19052626366" title="The 2016 Arc&#x27;teryx Footwear News - Outsides by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/444/19052626366_d607d066f4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="521" alt="The 2016 Arc&#x27;teryx Footwear News - Outsides" /></a></p>

<h2 id="acrux-ar-alpine-boot">Acrux AR Alpine Boot</h2>

<p>The goal of Arc’teryx with the Acrux AR was to create a light, durable, weatherproof and well fitting double boot. The boot we saw and tried on at the Arc’teryx Academy arrived just that morning and so was an early pre-production model, but it should be relatively close to the boot that will be standing in the stores in 2016. I will share my impressions on the Arc’teryx boot and compare them to my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/01/scarpa-rebel-ultra-gtx.html">Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX</a> and <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/04/scarpa-phantom-ultra-boots.html">Scarpa Phantom Ultra Boots</a>, both boots that I think are damn near perfect. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18458184033" title="Arc&#x27;teryx Acrux AR GTX Alpine Boot in its natural Habitat by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3695/18458184033_16a7489781_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Arc&#x27;teryx Acrux AR GTX Alpine Boot in its natural Habitat" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18427468573" title="I &lt;3 my Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX Boots by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/290/18427468573_44079149bf_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="I &lt;3 my Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX Boots" /></a></p>

<h2 id="the-lightness-of-being">The Lightness of Being</h2>

<p>My Rebel Ultra GTX are 773 g per boot in Size 42,5 or 1.546 g for the pair, and the Phantom Ultra Boots are 918 g per shoe in Size 42,5 or 1.845 g for the pair. Keep in mind that these both are single boots! The Acrux AR GTX is a double boot - it has a removable liner - and one boot will weigh 940 g or 1.880 g for the pair in UK Size 8.5. So it is better to compare it to something like the <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/scarpa-phantom-6000-schuhe-orange-38/">Scarpa Phantom Ultra 6000</a> (2.000 g per pair in Size 42) and the <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/la-sportiva-spantik-schuhe-grey-yellow-grey-yellow-38/">La Sportiva Spantik</a> (2.400 g per pair in Size 42). These are quite a bit more heavy than the Acrux AR GTX, and I am not aware of a lighter alpine double boot (there are lighter skiing boots available).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18891197418" title="Arc&#x27;teryx Acrux AR GTX Alpine Boot by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/370/18891197418_1fe5583699_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Arc&#x27;teryx Acrux AR GTX Alpine Boot" /></a></p>

<h2 id="durable--weatherproof-construction">Durable &amp; Weatherproof Construction</h2>

<p>The boot is made to last - how long that is depends on how often you’re out in the mountains. If that’s just once a year for two weeks these probably will last you several years, while if you’re a Mountain Guide they only might last a season or two. The boot made a very sturdy impression on me, with the weakest link probably being the T-Zip Zipper which makes the gaiter waterproof. Maybe a quick look at the construction is in order:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Inside you find a <strong>Removable Gore-Tex Liner Booty</strong> which also packs some insulation and so keeps your feet warm</li>
  <li>The Boot has on the inside a <strong>PE Inner Shell</strong> construction which does not absorb moisture and has a lacing system for a secure and good fit</li>
  <li>On the outside we have a <strong>Laminated Waterproof Gaiter</strong> which closes with the T-Zip zipper for complete protection from snow, water and the cold</li>
  <li>Around the bottom of the boot there’s a <strong>Laminated Watertight Construction</strong> which has a 0,6 mm thick TPU film for high abrasion and puncture resistance</li>
  <li>The <strong>Midsole</strong> is very elaborate and made from six pieces which are custom made for this boot, in every size! It’s made up of a Carbon Fibre frame, an EVA Midsole and is protected by a wrapped TPU moulded heel and toe cap</li>
  <li>And underneath this all is a <strong>Vibram Mountaineering Outsole</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18458178933" title="Arc&#x27;teryx Acrux AR GTX Alpine Boot Sole Parts by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/420/18458178933_c6fb463767_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Arc&#x27;teryx Acrux AR GTX Alpine Boot Sole Parts" /></a></p>

<p>This all creates a durable boot which will be great for your alpine adventures and ice climbing alike. Oh, and a really cool is that the shoe can be re-soled, despite the elaborate sole construction.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19082087401" title="Arc&#x27;teryx Acrux AR GTX Alpine Boot by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/435/19082087401_7f2ebc7519_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Arc&#x27;teryx Acrux AR GTX Alpine Boot" /></a></p>

<p>The goal of the Acrux AR GTX Boot was to make a double liner boot that low in volume - more akin to the Scarpa Phantom Ultra - while bing warmer than the Rebel Ultra GTX. The boot we saw certainly achieved that goal, and was not much bigger than the Rebel Ultra GTX in volume, and lower in volume than the Phantom Ultras I have. I find low volume boots not just aesthetically better, but they also more practical in use in my opinion: I can climb better in a low volume boot, find easier foot holds in tight spots and it’s easier to get your pants over them, too.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18458165843" title="Arc&#x27;teryx Acrux AR GTX Alpine Boot by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/528/18458165843_aa936d77db_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Arc&#x27;teryx Acrux AR GTX Alpine Boot" /></a></p>

<h2 id="impressions--conclusions">Impressions &amp; Conclusions</h2>

<p>I’m used to very light footwear - <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/luna-sandals-oso.html">Luna Sandals</a> I love for hiking and every day use, and on the trail I often sport a pair of <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/10/inov-8-trailroc-235.html">trailrunners</a> - so boots always will feel heavy to me. I tried the Acrux AR GTX Boot on and walked a bit around in them - not really a test thus - and they certainly felt heavy to me, especially since I also had my Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX boots along for my clinics. But they weren’t uncomfortably heavy and of course it is better to evaluate them when using them in cold weather in the mountains and not in front of a Restaurant, where they will probably not feel heavy anymore, but I’d likely appreciate their warmth at -5°C at 3.800 m altitude.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18458171633" title="Arc&#x27;teryx Acrux AR GTX Alpine Boot by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3832/18458171633_4aa257f560_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Arc&#x27;teryx Acrux AR GTX Alpine Boot" /></a></p>

<p>The boot was comfortable on my foot, the inside lacing enabled a secure fit with a Velcro Strap which held it in place. The Gaiter is adjusted via a Drawstring in the back and the gaiter is easy to open and close with the T-Zip zipper. The liner was warm and comfortable, and the adaptive fit will mould the liner over time to your foot for a personal fit. The seamless construction of the liner should minimize blisters and pressure points if that’s something you have problems with in other boots, and because it can be removed you can dry it faster or use it as a hut/ camp bootie.</p>

<p>The <strong>Conclusion</strong> is that the Arc’teryx Acrux AR GTX Alpine Boot certainly is a boot waiting for if you’re often out on Multi-Day adventures in the mountains. At 600€ it is competitively priced, the low volume and being a double boot sets it apart from the competition and it is very well made. I hope to be able to put them through their paces in the future and share a detailed review on them after a lot of use.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18891192148" title="Acrux SL Men&#x27;s &amp; Women&#x27;s + Arakys Men&#x27;s by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/377/18891192148_e57cbdc64a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Acrux SL Men&#x27;s &amp; Women&#x27;s + Arakys Men&#x27;s" /></a></p>

<h2 id="acrux-sl--arakys-shoes">Acrux SL &amp; Arakys Shoes</h2>

<p>Besides the Acrux AR Alpine Boot Arc’teryx will also launch a <strong>S</strong>uper<strong>L</strong>ight version of the Acrux, which will tip the scales at 300 g per shoe. It has no Gote-Tex lining (Yay!), a Vibram Megagrip sole and is made for demanding approaches and descents. The Acrux SL comes in a Men’s and Women’s Version in four colours each. I think this will be a great crag/ every day outdoor shoe that will be popular, I certaily would pick a pair up.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19082127781" title="Acrux SL Women&#x27;s Above by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/308/19082127781_e5d1fcf646_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Acrux SL Women&#x27;s Above" /></a></p>

<p>And the other new shoe is the Arakys. Arc’teryx promotes it as a “<em>ultralight bouldering and single pitch approach shoe designed for indoor and outdoor climbers</em>”. The closure system can be operated with one hand and is easy to switch from climbing (closed) to belaying (open). The heel is collapsible and turns it into a slipper. It will weigh about 270 g per shoe in UK Size 8.5, has a Vibram MegaGrip sole and comes also in a Men’s and Women’s Version with four colours per sex. I probably wouldn’t use it for climbing &amp; bouldering, but for approaches, at the crag and scrambles it probably would be very nice. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19082093501" title="Arc&#x27;teryx Arakys Men&#x27;s Side by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/319/19082093501_3cc742e332_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Arc&#x27;teryx Arakys Men&#x27;s Side" /></a></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>2015 was the 4th <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/07/arcteryx-alpine-academy-2014.html">Arc’teryx Alpine Academy</a> overall and my second one to attend. I was lucky enough to be invited as a member of the Press this year so got a sneak peak at the cool new gear that will come next year from Arc’teryx, and like everyone got the chance to hang out with the athletes, try out cool gear from Arc’teryx, Petzl, Scarpa, MSR and LYO Food and have a great time in Chamonix with the other participants. Here’s a re-cap of the three clinics I visited, which should be interesting if you’re considering to visit the Arc’teryx Academy in 2016!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18860432990" title="At the Base Station by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/499/18860432990_234d5c5a7f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="At the Base Station" /></a></p>

<h2 id="glacier-preparation-clinic">Glacier Preparation Clinic</h2>

<p>I haven’t been to Mer de Glace last year so decided that the <a href="http://chamonix.arcteryxacademy.com/shop/a-beginners/clinic-03-glacier-preparation-clinic/">Glacier Preparation Clinic</a> would be a good start for the weekend in Chamonix. The Mer de Glace is also only at about 1.900 m height which makes for easier acclimatisation, which worked well for me - last year I went straight up to 3.800 m, and living at sea level that’s quite a bit of difference. </p>

<p>Our group of four were with BMG and IFMGA Mountain Guide <a href="http://stuartmacdonald.org/">Stuart MacDonald</a> which was a great guy which explained us everything we needed to know about walking on a Glacier. After taking the train up to the Grand Hotel Du Montevers we walked to the ladders and started the descent down to the Glacier. It’s an interesting thing, as less than 150 years ago you could walk onto the Glacier from where you embark the train - climate change is showing its ugly face here, and it will be interesting to see how much more the glacier will retreat.</p>

<p>Once you’re down the ladders you walk over the moraine till you’re at the proper glacier. Here Stuart explained us how to put on our crampons and how to walk normally in them, which we did for a bit. Then we moved on to learn more crampon techniques, front pointing, and how to use our ice axe. If you haven’t used these ever before its a good clinic to get to know the basics, so that you can do for example glacier hikes in the future.</p>

<p>After that we went to a steep section where a glacial river has carved a deep gorge into the ice, set up anchors and started to first walk steep ice up, and then ice climb it. The latter exercise was great fun, as we went from two ice tools to one ice tool to no ice tool, which taught you about proper foot placement and keeping your balance. This was the most fun part for me and I could have done it all afternoon long. Alas, we wanted to catch the 15 o’clock train down so after everyone made a lap down and up we started the walk back to the train station. </p>

<h2 id="advanced-alpine-techniques">Advanced Alpine Techniques</h2>

<p>The Arête des Cosmiques has been on my Tick List for a long time, and I was a bit jealous when my mate did it last year in his Technical Mountaineering course while we did the Pointes Lachenal Traverse. Waking up on Saturday morning after maybe one Génépi too much I was sure that today I’d be going on the Cosmiques, and lo and behold: As I arrived punctually at the Aiguille du Midi base station <a href="http://www.chamonix-guides.eu/Trombinoscope/251/contact/jean_villard_guides/23-trombinoscope.htm">Jean Villard</a> told me with a smile that the weather is so good that he thinks we should do the Cosmiques today, because we can learn &amp; practice all the techniques on it that we should do in our <a href="http://chamonix.arcteryxacademy.com/shop/c-advanced/clinic-06-sat-adv-tech-alpinism/">Advanced Alpine Techniques clinic</a>. We drove up in the first Gondola and met the two other clients who slept the night up on the glacier, roped up and started the approach to the Arête des Cosmiques. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19053159461" title="The start of the Arête des Cosmiques by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/421/19053159461_dfe9b0da84_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="The start of the Arête des Cosmiques" /></a>

<p>At the Abri Simond hut we untied, roped up again and started up the route. It starts off with easy snow &amp; ice covered slabs which we protected with an occasional friend. At the Gendarme then came the first abseil, which had me a bit nervous - wrongly, though. Then it are a few more steps to the 2nd abseil, where you need to squeeze yourself backwards through a narrow chimney, which again was somehow feeling a bit dodgy to me, but again was no problem. After that followed some easy traversing to the 2nd tower, where we passed the <a href="http://www.chamonixtopo.com/digital-crack-aiguille-du-midi">Digital Crack</a>, the highest 8a in Europe. It looked like a beautiful line and should I ever reach that level, I’m sure to try it. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19023712866" title="Scrambling by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/520/19023712866_9dcd627ea1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Scrambling" /></a>

<p>But our climbing, at a much lower grade, was coming: The 4a Crux pitch. Jean free soloed it up without problems - he probably does that route a dozen times per year, and he’s already very long a Mountain Guide! - and then we followed. It was very easy even with crampons on, so even if you’re not a climber this shouldn’t have you worried in my opinion. As we were the first rope team on the route that day and we lost our pursuers after the first rappel we had a leisurely lunch on top of the Crux pitch, enjoyed the Alpine Choughs which were sailing above us and the beautiful sunshine. </p>

<p>After the nice break we continued onto the North Face of the route, and it got a wee bit colder in the shadow. But the scrambling over large boulders and through chimneys kept us warm enough until we reached the final plateau before the Aiguille du Midi cable car station. I had Georg, Johannes and Jean walk up to a pillar to take a few photos, and the people on the view platform went completely mad =) As we climbed the wee ladder up we were welcomed like celebrities and had our photos taken with strangers!</p>

<p>It was a four hour round trip for us four (three clients, one Guide) with one long break for lunch, if you go alone or just two you probably can do it in a couple of hours or less - when there’s not a lot of people on the route, as it is very popular! It definitely is worth a visit, as it is a very scenic route that’s great to practice alpine climbing and mountaineering skills.</p>

<h2 id="bigwall-climbing">Bigwall Climbing</h2>

<p>Sunday and <a href="http://chamonix.arcteryxacademy.com/shop/c-advanced/clinic-19-sun-big-wall-climbing/">Bigwall Climbing</a> was a great combination. The Bigwall Climbing clinic was new this year and very popular, and I think for a good reason: With a Client to Athlete to Guide Ratio of 3:1:1 it’s a fantastic clinic to learn new skills, ask a lot of questions and practice a lot. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18863698930" title="On the way to the Gongola by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/562/18863698930_34a87765fc_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="On the way to the Gongola" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19025173796" title="Bigwall Clinic group by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3746/19025173796_f7399d1035_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Bigwall Clinic group" /></a></p>

<p>The Bigwall Climbing consisted of four stations: The Portaledge Station, Jumaring, and two Aid Climbing stations - one with friends and nuts, the other with pitons and skyhooks. Because of time constraints I only got to try the first three, but on the plus side I was able to practice how to ascend the rope with some of my own gear (<a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/wild-country-ropeman-mk2f-steigklemme/">Ropeman 2</a> + <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/petzl-micro-traxion-seilrolle/?pid=81">Micro Traxion</a> in case you’re wondering). <a href="https://www.facebook.com/marcandreclimb">Marc-André Leclerc</a> showed us how to jumar the traditional way, with two <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.co.uk/petzl-ascension-ascender/">Jumars</a> and <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.co.uk/black-diamond-alpine-aiders-ladder/">Aider Ladders</a>. It was interesting to try this, as it always looks so easy in movies, but until you have found out the rhythm it wasn’t as easy as it looks!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18428873064" title="Marc-André explaining how to jumar by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3777/18428873064_d2a06da4f9_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Marc-André explaining how to jumar" /></a>

<p>After that <a href="http://arcteryx.com/Athlete.aspx?EN/PaulMcSorley">Paul McSorley</a> showed us how to set up a Portaledge Camp, keep the camp in order and haul gear up. It was super interesting and as Paul has slept a few nights in Portaledges it was cool to hear his stories and tips on how to camp comfortably on a Bigwall. Sleeping on a Portaledge in Yosemite is high on my list, and this clinic certainly has me psyched to make that dream come true some day soon.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18865219979" title="&quot;And that&#x27;s how you keep things tidy&quot; by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/316/18865219979_96ac17bd8d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="&quot;And that&#x27;s how you keep things tidy&quot;" /></a>

<p>And then we went Aid Climbing. <a href="http://www.bigwall.ch/">Pesche Wüthrich</a> explained Hayden and me the ins and outs, and then we both scaled the crack on aid. Slowly. Because Aid Climbing, we learned, needs a lot of time. You place gear, clip in the ladder and Daisy Chain, slowly weigh it to see if it holds, then clip in your Fiffi hook, and repeat. The route we climbed was a super easy crack which we probably could have climbed half a dozen times without Aid gear on lead, but this was a cool way to try it out and learn about it. The beauty/ attractiveness of it is certainly that you can climb safely on your own.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>I arrived Thursday morning and left Sunday afternoon, but happily would have stayed a bit longer in this fine Alpine Climbing &amp; Mountaineering Playground. My 2nd Arc’teryx Alpine Academy was again a lot of fun &amp; very inspirational, where I met great people, learned new skills, and got to climb in Europe’s best alpine climbing destination. What made me very happy was that there were a lot of people from all skill levels who decided to come to the <a href="https://instagram.com/explore/tags/arcteryxacademy/">#ArcteryxAcademy</a> to learn mountaineering and climbing skills. I shared the rope with hillwalkers from the UK &amp; Malaysia, aspiring mountaineers from Austria and Bigwall Climbers from the USA, Canada and France, and met old friends from across the globe. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19045840552" title="Hiking into the fog by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3818/19045840552_36c47c9f90_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Hiking into the fog" /></a></p>

<p>Again I can only recommend aspiring mountaineers and alpinists as well as backpackers &amp; hikers who’d like to up their skills to visit the <a href="http://chamonix.arcteryxacademy.com/">Arc’teryx Alpine Academy</a>. This year there were less people which in my opinion improved the learning and safety on the mountains, and made the groups more cozy &amp; personal, with more time for asking questions and trying techniques. The price-to-quality ratio still is superb, and if you consider all the free stuff available - the <a href="http://chamonix.arcteryxacademy.com/movie-night/">Movie Night</a>, the interesting <a href="http://chamonix.arcteryxacademy.com/seminar-night/">Seminars</a> and the <a href="http://chamonix.arcteryxacademy.com/demo-gear/">Demo Gear</a> - it really is very affordable. I certainly will keep a weekend free for next year for the 5th Arc’teryx Alpine Academy - if you’re smart, you’ll too! </p>

If it’s a good choice for your 3-season backpacking trips you read in my review.</p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.phdesigns.co.uk/minix-down-primaloft-sleeping-bag">PHD Minix Sleeping Bag</a> arrived last year May and has been used on several trips since, like my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/11/bouldering-on-aland.html">climbing roadtrip in Finland</a> and backpacking on the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/01/hogakustenleden-the-high-coast-trail.html">Högakustenleden</a>.</p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>The Minix is a sleeping bag, and so it’s function is to keep you warm while you sleep outdoors. </p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>PHD has this to say about the Minix:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Water-resistant Ultrashell outer (40 g/ m²)</li>
  <li>Primaloft Gold insulation on the base to handle damp &amp; maximise insulation under compression</li>
  <li>Box wall construction on top to maximise down loft</li>
  <li>900 fillpower European goose down</li>
  <li>Superlight MX inner (32 g/ m²)</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18199309079" title="PHD Minix Sleeping Bag bottom &amp; top by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/289/18199309079_157412966a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="PHD Minix Sleeping Bag bottom &amp; top" /></a></p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>PHD uses high-quality fabrics - a water-resistant outer, a box-wall construction for the 900 cuin down and Primaloft Gold - to create a ultralight sleeping bag. There’s also not many sleeping bags available that have a synthetic bottom and down on top - a smart way to use these two insulation materials.</p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>I own a few garments and the Minix from PHD and they are really of a superb quality. All of them are hand made in the UK, from the best and most functional materials. That quality has its price, but you’ll get many years of use out of them.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18197780400" title="PHD Minix Sleeping Bag Bottom by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7750/18197780400_0e075a9a30_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="PHD Minix Sleeping Bag Bottom" /></a></p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>The Minix I have - it’s the 2014 model which has a different colour than the 2015 one, otherwise they’re the same - weighs 575 g in Standard length, with the stuff sack tipping the scales at 25 g.</p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p>I really like using the Minix. While it needed some time to get used to the restricted movement that a sleeping bag offers, and that you only can get in via the top, once inside it was warm and comfy to sleep in. PHD gives the Minix a Comfort rating of 0°C and I can confirm that. With a T-shirt on the Minix kept me warm till 0°C, but once there was just some light minus degrees I immediately was cold in the sleeping bag. So for early spring and autumn trips you might want to take an extra baselayer along to sleep warm in the Minix, for all other times when the temperatures stay warm you can sleep just in your shirt and underwear in the Minix.</p>

<p>If it gets too warm - for me that’s +10°C and over - the Minix was very hot and I would start to perspire. This meant I would either pull the sleeping bag down to my waist to cool off or get completely out of the bag and just use it as a blanket over me, which allowed me to also leave a leg out to cool down. The Minix is very wide above so using it as a blanket worked well for me when laying on my back. I think the sleeping bag is ideal for temperatures between +1°C and +9°C, if it goes under 0°C you want to wear something in it, and if it goes over 10°C I do run to warm in it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18387090991" title="PHD Minix Hood Open by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/540/18387090991_edecbec72d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="PHD Minix Hood Open" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18381395682" title="PHD Minix Hood Closed by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/438/18381395682_1677d102c2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="PHD Minix Hood Closed" /></a></p>

<p>The freedom of movement inside of the sleeping bag is good, too. Because the Minix does not have a collar and just one drawstring to close the hole there’s not anything in the way on top, which makes turning around inside of the bag easy. The foot box was big enough for my size 42 feet and I also could lay in comfort on my side inside of the bag. </p>

<p>The Minix comes with a mesh storage bag and a 2 l stuff sack, the latter is great and well-suited for the bag but for the mesh bag I would prefer something larger from organic cotton. I have used the Minix with and without a bivy and with a bivy you have the added benefit of a mosquito protection and a few degrees more warmth. The Minix packs nice and small and lofts very quickly at camp. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17764852993" title="PHD Minix Footbox by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/277/17764852993_dd73e687ed_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="PHD Minix Footbox" /></a></p>

<h2 id="could-be-better">Could be better</h2>

<p>A small pocket for the drawstring on top would be great, I hate straps flying around my head and a pocket where I can stuff the drawstring in would take it out of the way and add just a couple of gram of weight. I’m also wondering if a light zipper down one side would be of benefit, while this would add quite a bit of weight it would make it easier to get in to the sleeping bag and also venting would be improved. </p>

<p>Finally, I wonder if the concept of the Minix - synthetic bottom and down top - would not be a great idea for a quilt. It would lose the hood most likely, but freedom of movement and venting would be improved a lot, and it even should be able to be lighter.</p>

<h2 id="competing-products">Competing Products</h2>

<p>If I just think about sleeping bags then the <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/mountain-hardwear-hyperlamina-spark-kunstfaserschlafsack/">Mountain Hardwear Hyperlamina Spark</a>, the <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/montane-featherlite-5-schlafsack-reg-links/">Montane Featherlite 5</a>, the <a href="http://bit.ly/1AInDmz">Rab Ascent 300</a> and the <a href="http://bit.ly/1cvmt1X">Western Mountaineering MegaLite</a> sleeping bags come to mind. The first is a synthetic sleeping bag while the other three are very good down sleeping bags, but none of these have two insulation materials in combination.</p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>If the idea of quilts is alien to you, then the Minix sleeping bag will be great for you. An ultralight sleeping bag that has a water-resistant shell you can use it without a bivy from spring to autumn as long as the thermometer stays above 0°C. The Primaloft bottom allows you to use a lighter, less insulated <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/sleeping-pads/">sleeping pad</a> as it is warm, even when compressed, and also is less sensitive to dew and moisture than down. The warm layer of 900 cuin down in box-wall construction on top keeps you toasty on fresh nights, and if it gets too warm you can even improvise the Minix into a narrow blanket. The water-resistant Ultrashell withstands dew and a light drizzle, protects the down and lets it loft nicely. If you want one sleeping bag for your 3-season trips that’s water-resistant, light, has a small pack size and is toasty warm, consider the Minix from PHD!</p>

<h2 id="where-to-buy-it">Where to buy it</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.phdesigns.co.uk/minix-down-primaloft-sleeping-bag">Minix</a> is part of the PHD <a href="http://stories.phdesigns.co.uk/summer-lightning-2015">Summer Lightning Collection</a> that is only available in May &amp; June from PHD directly - so hurry if you want this sleeping bag!</p>

    <updated>2015-05-22T22:48:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://hikinginfinland.com/2015/05/christopher-mcdougall-born-to-run</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s rare that I read a science/ novel/ diet/ adventure book which with each turn of the page has me think just one thing: I wanna go out for a run. Barefoot. <em><a href="http://amzn.to/1EnnrUf">Born to Run</a></em> is that book, and it is fortunate that the sun doesn’t set until 23 o’clock, leaving plenty of time for a quick run after reading in the evening.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17966167111" title="Born To Run by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7728/17966167111_9cc4bcb40f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Born To Run" /></a></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Born to Run sat for a while on my book shelf, and finally a couple of weeks ago I started reading it. Like many <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/books/">books</a> it was difficult to put down and but as the clock was going towards midnight I resistantly put the book down and went to sleep, just to read a couple more pages in the morning. As an ultralight backpacker and <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/luna-sandals-oso.html">Luna Sandals</a> enthusiast I have been since a long time an advocate of minimalist footwear, this book serves you with a great story why modern running (and hiking) shoes are bad for you &amp; great reasons why you should go for a run if you feel stressed. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Suffering is humbling. It pays to know how to get your butt kicked.</em> -Caballo Blanco</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But from the start. Christopher McDougall, the author, is a running enthusiast - but after plenty of problems with achilles tendons, knees and back pain he’s about to put his running shoes on the hook. After seeing a photo of a Tarahumara runner in a magazine while being on assignment in Mexico McDougall starts the search for these runners, which takes him deep down into the Copper Canyons in search of them and the mystical Caballo Blanco. What evolves is part adventure novel, part science &amp; nutrition journal and part sports history, in which you find out how McDougall went from almost stopping to run to running an Ultra in the Copper Canyon, meeting Scott Jurek and running with the elusive Tarahumara indians. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17777626938" title="Born To Run by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5321/17777626938_555fa11535_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Born To Run" /></a></p>

<p>Born to Run is mandatory reading for runners, and also backpackers - because the latter are just endurance runners that go a tad slower. It’s a gripping read that will have you forget the time while you turn each page in anticipation, ditch your running shoes, <a href="http://amzn.to/1Aju8Ms">try new foods</a>, ponder your first Ultra and having the itch to go out for a run. Pick Born To Run up at your local bookshop or order it from <a href="http://amzn.to/1EnnrUf">Amazon.com</a>, <a href="http://amzn.to/1FHztyZ">Amazon.co.uk</a> or <a href="http://amzn.to/1K8Ebns">Amazon.de</a> - and be prepared to wanna go running after reading a couple of pages!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I returned last Friday from a beautiful backpacking trip on the Via Dinarica in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It’s wild, gorgeous and has lots to offer to backpackers, packrafters, mountaineers and bikepackers alike. <em>A teaser of things to come.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17715452652" title="Looking towards Maglić by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7771/17715452652_19f6ddb3dd_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Looking towards Maglić" /></a></p>

<p>I’m a tad busy so a detailed write-up has to wait, but enjoy one photo of each day (and then book your flights to Sarajevo to experience your own Balkan adventure)!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17482619688" title="Snow Ridge by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5446/17482619688_90251c50aa_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Snow Ridge" /></a>
Day 1 gave a taste of the snowy things to come. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17788651356" title="In the mist &amp; rain on Prenj by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8837/17788651356_56418d585d_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="In the mist &amp; rain on Prenj" /></a>
Day 2 brought rain, mist and climbing 60° snow slopes without mountaineering gear.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17194614483" title="Jezerce Mountain Hut in the background by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7770/17194614483_2bf6ddcfb6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Jezerce Mountain Hut in the background" /></a>
A relaxed lunch was had at the Jezerce Mountain Hut on Day three.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17192476044" title="Dubocani village by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8868/17192476044_a79da411f8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Dubocani village" /></a>
Nestled in the lush, green valley was the Dubocani village we passed on Day four.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17192470994" title="Upward to Maglić by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5467/17192470994_490c3fd46a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Upward to Maglić" /></a>
And on Day five we climbed up to Maglić, the highest summit of Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>

<p>The new issue has a very lengthy special on Via Ferratas by me, as well as hiking in dangerous terrain. The latter gives tips on what to do when there’s no blue bird weather but you’re confronted by hail, snow and strong winds, how to cross rivers and what to consoder when you’re in the mountains and on glaciers. In my gear column I talk about approach shoes and review five pairs of approach shoes from <a href="http://bit.ly/1zDfoq6">adidas</a>, <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/05/arcteryx-acrux2-fl-gtx.html">Arc’teryx</a>, <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/lowa-laurin-gtx-lo-approachschuhe/">Lowa</a>, <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/five-ten-guide-tennie-schuhe-ca-sun-ca-sun-uk4/">Five Ten</a> and <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/salomon-x-alp-gtx-approachschuhe/">Salomon</a>. There’s also great tips on outdoor photography and plenty of great trip reports in Germany, Austria, Italy and Romania.</p>
