    <id>http://hikinginfinland.com/2016/05/a-leg-for-laufbursche</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Mateusz, backpacker and manufacturer of the ultralight <a href="http://www.ilovelaufbursche.de/english/">LAUFBURSCHE</a> backpacks, lost a leg in his battle against cancer. With this fundraiser I want to help him pay his medical bills and hopefully get a prosthesis that allows him to go hiking again. [<strong>Updated with winner!</strong>]</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="http://www.ilovelaufbursche.de/english/" title="ILoveLAUFBURSCHE.com"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7176/26188616394_48ddfab21e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="615" alt="ILoveLAUFBURSCHE.com" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Mateusz and I met the first time six years ago when he joined a group of ultralight backpackers who followed my invite for an <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2010/02/tufwt-1-0-trip-report.html">Ultralight Winter trip</a>. We hiked, laughed, camped in the snow, went to Sauna and jumped into the ice hole together, and have been in contact ever since. I was lucky enough to get one of the very first 40D black Silnylon huckePACKs, a design which was back then and still today is revolutionary. As an Architect Mateusz has a great eye for functional design, and his backpacks are considered far and wide works of art. My “Packing your framless backpack - LAUFBURSCHE huckePACK” video is probably my most-watched video on Youtube, and it is that backpack which I today will to raffle off in support of Mateusz. </p>

<iframe width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MDF26eJ2sqU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>As a fellow entrepreneuer I know that should sickness strike then shit hits the fan, and it’s sadly not different for Mateusz. Many other’s have written about his condition so I do not want to concentrate on it here, but instead send good vibes and support his way and a one-of-a-kind LAUFBURSCHE huckePACK your way. The pack is in great condition without any damage, is made of black 40d Silynlon with an XPAC floor, is Size L (which fits me at 175 cm very well) and weighs with all the straps attached 343 g. I guesstimate the volume at around 35 to 45 l, so it’s a great size for a week long trip in the mountains or woods.</p>

<p><em>So, how do you get a chance on winning this backpack AND help Mateusz?</em> </p>

<ul>
  <li>One lottery ticket costs 5€, and you can buy as many as you’d like. More tickets obviously increase your chances to win this unique pack and help Mateusz more!</li>
  <li>You Donate for each lottery ticket you’d like to buy 5€ to Mateusz via <a href="http://www.ilovelaufbursche.de/english/">this website</a> (<em>you can donate via PayPal or bank transfer, please follow the simple instructions given over there for your donation</em>)</li>
  <li>You send an Email with a screenshot of the confirmed donation to <em>laufbursche[ät]hikinginfinland.com</em> with your name and the amount of lottery tickets you purchased</li>
  <li>If you like, comment underneath to let others know how many tickets you have bought =)</li>
  <li>You can buy lottery tickets till the 22nd of May, Midnight Finnish time</li>
  <li>On the 23rd of May I will put all tickets in a hat and my son will pull out one lucky winner who gets the backpack!</li>
</ul>

<p>If you just like to help and have already enough huckePACKs, just head over to <a href="http://www.ilovelaufbursche.de/english/">I Love LAUFBURSCHE</a> and donate. Every donation is appreciated and helps Mateusz on the long trail of rehabilitation and getting back outdoors. <em>To read more about Mateusz condition head over to <a href="http://www.outdoormaedchen.de/2016/04/crowdfunding-laufbursche.html">Outdoormädchen</a>, <a href="https://limitcamper.wordpress.com/2016/04/27/i-love-laufbursche/">Limitcamper</a> or the <a href="http://www.ultraleicht-trekking.com/forum/topic/3737-ein-laufbursche-für-den-laufburschen/">various</a> <a href="http://www.ultraleicht-trekking.com/forum/topic/3626-die-gute-tat-für-laufbursche-frühling/">threads</a> on <a href="http://www.ultraleicht-trekking.com/forum/topic/3495-laufbursche-genesungswünsche/">Ultraleicht</a> <a href="http://www.ultraleicht-trekking.com/forum/topic/3504-schulterschluss-für-mateusz/">Trekking</a>.</em></p>

<h2 id="update-23052016">Update 23.05.2016</h2>

<p>Wow, what a great effort! There were donations for a total of 201 lottery tickets, with some donations which didn’t want to enter, which raised a grand total of 1.295 € for Mateusz! I imagine that helps him with getting a ultralight carbon or titanium part for his prosthesis! The winner of the huckePACK has already been contacted and I hope she will enjoy hiking with the pack =)</p>

<p>Of course we don’t need to stop now - Mateusz is still battling with the complications of his sickness, and you can still <a href="http://www.ilovelaufbursche.de/english/">donate</a> to support him. Every small donation helps, so just drink one less fancy coffee and donate that sum instead =)</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer: I have no financial benefit in this campaign. Mateusz is a friend of mine and I want to help him pay his medical bills &amp; hike again in the future.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.walden-magazin.de">WALDEN</a> is a new German magazine which not only has a fantastic layout &amp; design, the content and stories in it also are top-notch. Thus it was a nice surprise to be asked if I’d like to contribute a short piece to the third issue - and now I’m part of the WALDEN family. Read my and other outdoor blogger’s spring tips in issue three which you can <a href="http://shop.geo.de/einzelhefte/walden/walden-01-2016.html">order here</a>.</p>

<p>I already mentioned my online piece about <a href="http://www.oe-mag.co.uk/imag/oemarchapril2016/files/36.html">Via Ferratas</a> in the Outdoor Enthusiast Magazine a month or two ago, but the article is also in the print magazine.

<p>For both the <a href="http://www.biketravel-magazin.com">Bike &amp; Travel Magazine</a> and <a href="http://www.trekkingmagazin.com">trekking Magazin</a> I have been writing a company portrait of Thule, the Swedish company that’s well-known for their innovative transport solutions for bikes &amp; skis. Both pieces are slightly different, so if you want to know more about Thule’s backpack line make sure to grab a copy of the trekking Magazin while if you’re a cyclist and want to know about their panniers and child transporters grab the Bike &amp; Travel Magazin!</p>

<p>I met <a href="http://www.christine-on-big-trip.blogspot.fi">Christine</a> two years ago as she was cycling through Finland, and we spent a nice afternoon eating cake and sushi in Vaasa. Of course I knew her much longer digitally, but it was really nice to finally met her and hear more about her stories from hiking, paddling and cycling around the globe. If you’re not so lucky to meet German Tourist (her Trailname) then you should pick up a copy of her book <em>Laufen. Essen. Schlafen.</em> which was published just a month ago. It’s in German, though, so I hope your Deutsch skills are up to scratch. The book chronicles GT’s decision from first hiking one long-distance trail in the US to all three and abandoning a <em>normal</em> 9-to-5 life. </p>

<p>The book starts out with Christine as a successful business women who is on holiday in the US, to losing her job and a good friend which in turn make her decide to go hiking the Pacific Crest Trail. The hiking story reminded me in parts of Keith’s <a href="http://amzn.to/1XbLlQl">The Last Englishman</a>, a book about Keith’s PCT hike. It’s a mix of trail description, <em>trail talk</em> (gossip) and Chrisitine’s experiences on the PCT. The PCT chapter is also the longest of the 288 page long book, with each subsequent chapter getting shorter. </p>

<p>The CDT chapter then starts again with Christine the successful business woman, a romance that’s doomed from the start, and the hard hiking life on the CDT. No rest days for three and a half months! During the CDT chapter German Tourist meets friends from the PCT again, loses her job while hiking the CDT and subsequently decides to quite the 9-to-5 rat race life. The AT chapter, which is a mere fifty something pages, then feels hurried. There’s the misery at the start, the realization that she does not need to hurry anymore, more meetings with old friends from the PCT and pretty autumn hiking through the green jungle. </p>

<p>I read the book in a day and overall found it an enjoyable read. There were a few sections that made me thoughtful, sad, laugh and anticipate what would happen next. The book is entertaining, but I felt that in the CDT and AT chapter Christine was just in a hurry to finish the book and get outdoors again - I would have wished for similar insights &amp; details from her about these two trails, too. Despite this I think it is a great read for anyone who is interested in hiking and long-distance backpacking, as Christine writes eloquently about the life on the trail and what it entails. The sections about her conversations with fellow thru-hikers and trail angels where my favourites by far, and made me want to pack my backpack and fly over to the USA!

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ski-touring in late April: Daylight from 4 am till 10 pm, great powder or spring crust, wall-to-wall sunshine &amp; all topped off with that breath-taking fjord &amp; mountain view of the Lyngen Alps.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26741128546/in/dateposted/" title="Sunset"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1508/26741128546_756a100b4c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Sunset" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Together with Henryk from <a href="http://www.oooyeah.de">Out of Office</a> I spent a fantastic week in the Lyngen Alps. Here’s a wee teaser so you can book your flight tickets and accommodation there for next spring, because it most certainly is a place you want to be. It all starts in Tromsø, where already the approach by plane is breath-taking. Then you go for a walk in the old town and pick up your Van from <a href="http://www.takemeaway.no">Take me Away Camping</a> to head north-west to the Lyngen Alps and their surroundings.</p>

<p>You probably want to stop to take in the view once in a while.</p>

<p>When your bindings decides to break you go for a walk along the coast of Arnøya and make a stop in a lovely little cabin.</p>

<p>You take the ferry and enjoy the smell of the sea on deck.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26741113346/in/dateposted/" title="On a ferry"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1610/26741113346_46c00d88e5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="On a ferry" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And what’s wrong with sitting down in the sun and have a beer (after a day of skiing, obviously!)?</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26160876694/in/dateposted/" title="After-Ski beers"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1538/26160876694_c5b83977c5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="After-Ski beers" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>On the summit you snap a selfie with that big grin because the view is so amazing.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26160876794/in/dateposted/" title="Summit Selfie"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1504/26160876794_3853aab70b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Summit Selfie" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And while the tide is low you go for a walk along the beach.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26741128296/in/dateposted/" title="Evening Sunset"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1464/26741128296_d26a5e3531_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Evening Sunset" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Or you go skiing while the sun sets.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26741129446/in/dateposted/" title="Sunset skiing"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1719/26741129446_117610d8ae_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Sunset skiing" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>On blue-bird days the summits can be busy.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26160876444/in/dateposted/" title="Busy summit"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1462/26160876444_69cf794b5c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Busy summit" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>But there’s enough fjords so you can have one for yourself to enjoy the sunset.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26160876304/in/dateposted/" title="Fjord sunset"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1489/26160876304_454bd5c53c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Fjord sunset" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Travelling with your skis and packing for a week of ski-touring in the mountains seems daunting? No worries, with my packlist you’re ready to fly and ski a Haute Route without any packing problems!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26458154986/in/dateposted/" title="Packing for a ski-tour"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1512/26458154986_a0a9acf22a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Packing for a ski-tour" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Before my first ski-touring trip to Canada last year I was worried: How should I transport my skis, boots and everything else in a way that it arrives in one piece and that it is easy for me to carry? What do I all need to take? After much research, reading gear reviews, making my own experienced guesses and adapting my ultralight packing strategy for ski-touring I have arrived at a pack list &amp; travel setup that works very well. </p>

<p>My pack list does cut no corners and allows me to either ski in comfort from a base camp or can be adapted for a Haute-Route-style ski-tour where I sleep each night in a different hut. With changing the backpack I even can take camping equipment and pitch the tent on the top of a summit! For the travelling part this pack list allows me to take a variety of gear but still not feel like I’m an over-loaded donkey. Besides a dedicated ski bag I rely again on the awesome <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/10/one-duffle-to-rule-them-all-the-arcteryx-carrier-duffle.html">Arc’teryx Carrier Duffle</a> to transport gear via bus, train, plane and car, while on tour I’m carrying all I need outdoors in one backpack. It’s a versatile, light and durable list that’s equally suitable for a week of ski-touring in Lyngen or the Alps. </p>

<h2 id="when-skis-travel">When Skis Travel</h2>

<p>Travelling with skis can be easy, comfortable and fun - if you have a <a href="https://www.bergzeit.co.uk/douchebag-the-douchebag-ski-bag/?pid=81">Douchebag</a> to transport your skis. If you look past the name - which is fun in my opinion! - you get a ski bag which transports skis, boots, backpack, poles, avalanche kit and clothes in comfort. My 184 cm long DPS Wailer Tour1 skis fit perfectly into it with room to spare, and the Ribcage construction of the Douchebag ensures the skis and everything else inside stay safe. I have flown thousands of kilometers with the Douchebag, travlled hundreds of kilometers by train and car and the Douchebag has never let me down. Thanks to the two large wheels it is easy to pull the ski bag through airports and streets, and best of all: If not needed it can be rolled up into a compact little package which takes up little space. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25897550964/in/dateposted/" title="The Douchebag rolled up"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1492/25897550964_a09fd56363_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="The Douchebag rolled up" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>If I travel inside the Douchebag I put:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://bit.ly/1paqW0r">DPS Wailer Tour1 Skis</a> with <a href="https://www.bergzeit.co.uk/g3-ion-12-touring-binding/?pid=81">G3 Ion 12 Binding</a></li>

  <li><a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/04/la-sportiva-spectre.html">La Sportiva Spectre boots</a></li>

<h2 id="the-backpack">The Backpack</h2>

<p><em>Airbag or normal ski-touring bag</em>, that was the question I asked myself as I set out to add yet another backpack to the collection. While I’d love to have an <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/12/arcteryx-voltair-avalanche-airbag.html">Arc’teryx Voltair Avalanche Airbag</a> I settled for the lighter <a href="http://bit.ly/1pari78">Black Diamond Dawn Patrol 25 Pack</a> with the <a href="http://bit.ly/23GxUgv">Black Diamond Avalung Element</a>. It’s a reasonably light pack with an avy pocket in the front, a spacious google pocket and a large main compartment that’s opened via a zipper in the back panel - this keeps gear out of the snow. I also can carry my helmet at the front of the pack, and also the skis or a snowboard attach to the Dawn Patrol 25. If I travel I usually take this backpack also as a carry-on, and it fits my 15” MBP nicely into the main compartment with room to spare for cables, a book and more. </p>

<p>Getting that all in can be a real Tetris-like experience, especially if the Hut-to-Hut stuff comes in, too! And of course, depending on where I am out, also a map, compass and a watch with GPS &amp; Altimeter are along.</p>

<h2 id="layering-for-ski-touring">Layering for ski-touring</h2>

<p>Layering for ski-touring is much like <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/02/layering-guide-how-to-dress-for-winter.html">layering for winter</a>. I wear a thin baselayer, thin midlayers, if it is cold an insulation vest, and depending on the weather either a softshell or a hardshell top &amp; bottom. I try to only take either shell layer along to save weight &amp; space, but depending on the weather forecast can be a bit risky. The underneath garments have proven themselves and work very well for me and I can recommend each piece. Besides that they also are comfortabl and look cool on photos.</p>

<h2 id="the-hut-to-hut-extras">The Hut-to-Hut Extras</h2>

<p>My Hut-to-Hut Extras include a silk inlet which I bought many years ago, as it is more hygienic and is wished for by hut owners, and some spare clothes. While I maintain the principle that I’m on a ski-tour and not on a fashion show it is nice to switch into dry and non-smelly clothes after a day on the mountain. I usually switch into dry underwear, socks and put on the shirt, while wearing the Northern Playground Ziplongs. I pack it all in an <a href="https://www.bergzeit.de/eagle-creek-pack-it-specter-quarter-cube-white-strobe/?pid=81">Eagle Creek Pack-It Specter Quarter Cube</a> which fits well into my pack, right between the ION ski crampons.</p>

<h2 id="the-camping-extras">The Camping Extras</h2>

<p>Sometimes you just want to pitch the tent on the summit, take the stove out and watch the stars and Northern Lights. Depending on the need of the tent it can be <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/09/hyperlite-mountain-gear-ultamid.html">lighter</a> or heavier, but what’s sure is that I need a larger backpack to carry it and the other kit! We’re having this planned for next week up north in Lyngen, so stay tuned on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hendrikm/">Instagram</a> for a <em>“tent on summit under Northern Lights”</em> shot. </p>

<h2 id="at-basecamp">At Basecamp</h2>

<p>Often my ski-touring trips also involve staying in a town, which means after a day on the mountain I can jump into the Sauna, eat some tasty food and drink a beer. I usually have an extra nice-looking shirt along (the <a href="https://www.norrona.com/en-GB/Products/3360-14/1011/falketind-long-sleeve-shirt-m/">Norrøna falketind Longsleeve</a> is a favourite), but otherwise I wear the clothes I am also travelling in (usually an <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/houdini-thrill-twill-pants-jeans/">Houdini Thrill Twill Pants</a> or the <a href="http://amzn.to/1SpbZoV">Icebreaker Seeker Pants</a> and the awesome <a href="http://partner.bergfreunde.de/go.cgi?pid=10239&amp;wmid=cc&amp;cpid=1&amp;subid=SkiPackList&amp;target=https://www.bergfreunde.de/ortovox-rnw-cool-double-check-shirt-long-sleeve-hemd/?_$ja=tsid:52154">Ortovox R’N’W Cool Double Check Shirt</a>). If you’re into Aprés skiing you probably wanna take more, I myself am happy to read a book and go to sleep reasonably early!</p>

<p>So, that’s my ski-touring packing list. A versatile list that uses only two pieces of check-in luggage - with some packing magic I also can get everything into the DOuchebag, but then it can get close to the 23 kg weight limit on most flights. The Arc’teryx Carrier Duffle also packs nicely down over the wheels of the Douchebag which means I can pull both bags, and the BD pack comes along as a carry-on. <strong>Happy travelling &amp; skiing!</strong></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ski-touring, that’s walking - skinning in skiing terms - the mountain up and then skiing it down. It’s a great way to enjoy the mountains in winter and has similarities to hiking. But much unlike the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/gear-reviews/">light trailrunners</a> I use from spring till autumn, in winter you need a ski boot. Happily I found after much research &amp; pondering a boot which is light and performs great on the way up &amp; down.</p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>I bought the Spectre after much research last November from the Bergfreunde, and have used it ski-touring in Canada, Finland, Austria, Switzerland and South Tyrol since, all in all over 20 days. It coming along to Lyngen next week, too!</p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>A ski-touring boot has two modes: A Walk mode for skinning up the mountain and a ski-mode to come down again. The walk mode gives you freedom of movement for sliding the ski forward while you skin up, and the ski mode makes the boot stiff so you can transfer your power onto the binding and ski.  Normal Alpine Skiing boots miss the walk feature, and while you might be able to skin up short sections for serious ascents you want a <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/tourenskischuhe/">ski boot</a> with a walk mode. </p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>As told by La Sportiva, the Spectre comes with these features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>4 Buckles plus optional Power Strap</li>
  <li>60° Range of Motion</li>
  <li>120 Flex</li>
  <li>3 preset Forward Lean options: 10°, 14° and 18°</li>
  <li>Tech and AT Bindings compatible</li>
  <li>Dynafit inserts</li>
  <li>Rockered Vibram Sole</li>
  <li>Carbon Reinforced Grilamid Vertebra</li>
  <li>Marfram Spoiler</li>
  <li>Pebax Cuff</li>
  <li>Grilamid Shell</li>
  <li>Sole length xxx mm in MP 26.5</li>
  <li>Dual Density EZ Thermo liner</li>
  <li>And it is Made in Italy</li>
</ul>

<p>In the box you’ll find besides the boots two optional laces which allow you to get a tighter fit of the liner on your foot, two insoles, a few patches and tools.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26149575060/in/album-72157666988623142/" title="The La Sportiva Spectres"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1549/26149575060_5387ff101d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="776" alt="The La Sportiva Spectres" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>The Pegasus Buckles, which are flat when open which means they don’t snag on stuff close to your feet, and can comfortably be worn underneath your pants, are great. The buckles on my other ski-touring boot don’t lay flat so these are definitely more convenient in use. Additionally you can Micro-adjust the buckles for a perfect fit. The very low weight for a four-buckle boot is also a great achievement by La Sportiva.</p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>I haven’t been easy on the boots, and they have flown several thousands of miles across the globe in my <a href="https://www.bergzeit.de/douchebag-the-douchebag-skitasche-pitch-black/?pid=81">Douchebag</a>, skied and skinned thousands of meters, climbed ice in them and walked through town in them, and they still look good and only have minor scratches.</p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>My Size 26.5 Spectres weigh with liner 1374 g, that’s 240 g for the liner boot and 1134 g for the shell. The <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/12/arcteryx-procline-carbon-lite-ski-boot.html">Arc’teryx Procline Carbon Lite Ski Boot</a> is lighter, but I haven’t used it yet.</p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p><em>My experience is based on skiing the Spectre with <a href="http://bit.ly/22PDNaU">DPS Wailer 99 Tour1 Skis</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/20DPCfk">G3 ION 12 Bindings</a>.</em></p>

<p>There’s plenty of opinions on the Spectre - from people that really dislike the boot to ones that love it, and everything in between. There’s two things why I don’t love the boot outright: And that are the two blisters on my feet. After hiking in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/10/inov-8-trailroc-235.html">Trailrunners</a> for over seven years, climbing in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/01/scarpa-rebel-ultra-gtx.html">Mountaineering boots</a> for four and <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2011/01/backcountry-cross-country-skiing.html">XC skiing</a> in good boots since six years I haven’t had blisters anymore. But on my second ski-touring trip this year to <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/02/ski-touring-south-tyrol-and-salzburger-lungau.html">South Tyrol</a> and Salzburger Lungau, on the second day blisters appeared on the inside of my ankles. Compeed helped in allowing me to ski the next few weeks, but even after the blister healed they were there again after a day of skiing on the next trip. Blisters are no fun, and while I happily bite my teeth together and continue to wear the boots I think I either will need to go with them to a good boot fitter (which, sadly, we don’t have in Vaasa) or try my hand at modifying the boot on my own; and as it is made from Grilamid which tends to hold its shape once punched (unlike Pebax, another plastic which is often used in the construction of ski boots) that might be a good option too. These problems came after moulding the liner twice and the shell once, by the way. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26149572410/in/album-72157666988623142/" title="Liner &amp; insole"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1650/26149572410_5f4caf3e9f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Liner &amp; insole" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Getting into the boot is easy for me, I have narrow feet and wear medium-thickness to thin skiing socks, and the shell has a medium to narrow heel fit, a narrow instep and has a medium forefoot last. The top buckles can be moved out of the way for easily getting in (and out) of the boot. After a day of touring getting out of the boot needs a bit of pulling - nothing difficult, though, and if I open all buckles it’s super-simple to get out. It’s recommended to play around with the boot and find the right adjustments for your style of skiing, and as the Spectre allows a host of possibilities to adjust it to your foot &amp; style - take the time to do it, you will have more fun in the long-run. Stepping in to the pin-binding of your choice is easy thanks to the two indicators on each side of the boot, these make it easy to align the boot with the pins and then push down so they snap into the fittings.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26422447775/in/album-72157666988623142/" title="Aligned"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1553/26422447775_1186807e11_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Aligned" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Other reviewers seem to take issues with the buckles. Yes, they’re different: You can micro-adjust them to your needs via the screw, and it takes some learning to get the hole placed over the stud - and it won’t snap over it unless you get the alignment correctly. I didn’t have any issues with them and found the system easy, and you can even adjust the buckles when you’re in the boot. I really liked the low profile buckle design which fits perfectly under the ski pants and does provide a cleaner profile &amp; prevents trees, rocks and stuff from catching the buckles, which protects them from being damaged and makes them last longer.</p>

<p>The Liner is warm and I never had cold feet in them. I needed to add the included lacing for them to move less on my foot while touring. It has a flex zone that helps in touring mode. The two loops at the front and back make it easy to pull the boot on. The liner keeps your sweaty feet smell well, so if you’re a connoisseur of such things you’re in luck. Otherwise you might want to dry and air them well before taking them in. </p>

<p>The sticky rubber sole is great and allows for great grip when scrambling or walking in town and slippery ski stations. The yellow areas at the toe and heel are more durable, and the higher arch minimizes snow-build-up in my experience. The Spectre is crampons compatible and my <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/camp-xlc-470-steigeisen/">CAMP XLC Crampons</a> are a great companion with them and make for an ultralight ski-mountaineering setup.</p>

<p>Alright, so getting in the boot is all swell, skinning up is great because the boot is light with a great range of motion, but what about switching into ski mode at the wind-blasted summit and the descent? I’m happy to report that it takes only a minute, it at all, to close all buckles and switch the boot into ski mode and if you have a wide ski pants you can even do it while the pants and snow-gaiter are down over the buckles (I have been using a <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/norroena-lyngen-driflex3-pants-hardshellhose/">Norrøna Lyngen softshell pants</a> and a <a href="http://www.arcteryx.com/product.aspx?language=EN&amp;gender=mens&amp;collection=Whiteline&amp;model=Stinger-Pant">Arc’teryx Stinger Pants</a> which both allowed to do this). Fussing around with boots at a windy &amp; cold summit is no fun, even less if you need to take the gloves off, and with the Spectre I was quickly ready to ski down. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26330086312/in/album-72157666988623142/" title="Walk"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1560/26330086312_3bf75c533d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Walk" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26149582890/in/album-72157666988623142/" title="Lean back"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1467/26149582890_7fb38ed8d6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Lean back" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I found the Spectre a stiff boot when tightly buckled down for the descent, and find it has good control and power transmission that could easily control my fat DPS Wailers on almost all snow conditions (hard, icy slopes in resorts are tough and my skis started flutter, but that’s another story). Buckled down the boot still had plenty of room in the toe box for warm toes, I haven’t experienced any shin bang which I thank the Booster Strap for, and the black EZ Flex area on the tongue gives a nice flex in downhill mode. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25817614954/in/album-72157666988623142/" title="Open!"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1592/25817614954_1d2f98d371_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Open!" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Some 20+ days are not really yet enough to give a comment on durability, so I will save that for a later time. But what’s worth discussing is the price of the Spectre. If you have read till here you might think that such a lightweight, innovative boot probably must cost a little fortune. Well, it does not. The regular, recommended price is around 490€ - but thanks to never-ending sales you can pick up the Spectre for as little as 370€. Even at the recommended price it’s an affordable ski boot, and if you can get it with a discount it is a lot cheaper than many other boots.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26396493176/in/album-72157666988623142/" title="Outside"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1600/26396493176_9a9a38a9e4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Outside" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="could-be-better">Could be better</h2>

<p>La Sportiva decided to update the Spectre for 2016/ 2017, which should address some of the issues described above and allow for even more customization. Even if I try hard, I can not imagine something to complain about this boot - I think the blisters are something that just happened and because I want to keep these boot it is something I need to find a way to solve &amp; life with.</p>

<h2 id="competing-products">Competing Products</h2>

<p>There’s a wide variety of <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/tourenskischuhe/">ski-touring boot</a> available, I myself also own the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/marken/scarpa/tourenskischuhe/">Scarpa Maestrale RS</a>, and many people like the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/dynafit-tlt-6-mountain-cr-tourenskischuhe/">Dynafit TLT 6</a>. In the end you should follow my final advice in the bottomline when it comes to buying boots.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26356257591/in/album-72157666988623142/" title="Spectre"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1505/26356257591_719db2aea1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Spectre" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>I decided the buy the Spectre because it is the lightest four buckle boot and would allow me an easier time on the way up - where I’d need to move the 1374 g per foot hundreds of times - and great control on the way down. So far it has performed great, and aside from the blisters which I hope to solve with some punches on the shell I imagine the boot will accompany for the next few ski-touring seasons. The Spectre is comfortable &amp; light on the way up and performs great on the way down, especially in powder. I love the low buckle design as they fit very well under my ski pants, the comfortable walking in town, and the cool look of the boot is also something I don’t get tired of. The light weight also make them good for climbing, be it rock or ice. Add in the amazing price and you have a boot which I am very happy with!</p>

<p><em>But the ultimate Bottomline for ski-boots is simple: If the boot fits and is comfortable, buy it. You might have the luck that your feet fit the Spectre out of the box, or they might not suit you at all - the general wisdom for ski boots is to buy a boot that fits you well, because everything else might end up in pain.</em></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You like to go outdoors and love a tricked out van or off-road vehicle to get there? Then <em>Off the Road</em> is the book for you - but careful, you might want to sell your house and move into a van!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26210796662/in/dateposted/" title="Off the Road Cover"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1665/26210796662_6361a93f26_b.jpg" width="1024" height="1024" alt="Off the Road Cover" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I don’t have a driving license. We don’t own a car. And yet I like the idea of living in a van or tricked-out off-road vehicle. Hence <a href="http://shop.gestalten.com/off-the-road.html">Off the Road</a> is such an appealing book. On over 250 pages and even more photos you get inspiration for your own #VanLife. Are you an BMW Enduro kind of guy, or an VW T4 aficionado? Does your heart beat for adventure off the beaten track in a Toyota Land Cruiser or do you prefer to have an adventure-ready trailer behind your car? This book illuminates people from all these roads &amp; more, with inspiring stories of people who rode from the most southern point in Florida to the most northerly point in Alaska or who crossed Russia from the west to the east. </p>

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/144480827?byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>But it has not only such adventurous expeditions in it, also more achievable #VanLife stories are in the book - things you can realize at the weekend or during your summer holidays. Like going to the beach with your trailer for a lonely weekend at the sea, or taking your van with the surfboards on top for a trip to search the best waves. There’s a bunch of vans, cars, trailers, motorcycles and off-road vehicle depicted in the book, complete with technical information and how to make them even more off-road worthy for your next big (or small) trip. Inspiration for how to renovate the interior of your van, why an Unimog still is one of the greatest All-terrain vehicles, and how you can transform your van into a mobile office which allows you from anywhere. </p>

<p>And the appeal also comes through to me, who is generally opposed to motorized outdoor activities. I could imagine trading the house for a small van, drive around the world and have a new view to wake up to each morning. Where I can sit in front of the car and drink a coffee, sit by the camp fire and watch the stars before going laying down on a comfortable bed, and which would allow me to just put on the skis in the morning and skin up a mountain. Of course I’d first need to get a driving license to do that =) But if you have one, and it sounds like a good life to you, pick up this book and be inspired by what is possible. Great photos and stories most likely will make you think if you really need a house, or if a nice off-road vehicle or van wouldn’t suffice for a life off the road!</p>

<h2 id="hetta">Hetta</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.tosilappi.fi">Hetta</a> is in the far, far north of Finland and that means: Lots of snow, crispy cold temperatures, Northern Lights and beautiful sunny days in spring. Last year we spent our winter holiday in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/04/winter-family-adventures-in-pyha-luosto.html">Pyhä</a> and this year we decided to visit another small and family-friendly town: Hetta. Right in the heart of Lapland it is located at the top of the <a href="http://www.nationalparks.fi/pallas-yllastunturinp">Pallas-Yllästunturi National Park</a> and the starting point of the <a href="http://www.nationalparks.fi/hettapallashikingtrail">Hetta-Pallas Trail</a> which you can ski in winter or hike in the summer. <a href="http://www.nationalparks.fi/poyrisjarvi">Pöyrisjärvi Wilderness Area</a> and <a href="http://www.nationalparks.fi/tarvantovaara">Tarvantovaara Wilderness Area</a> are right around the corner, and it isn’t far to Norway, either - which makes it an ideal base camp for outdoor and nature lovers in summer &amp; winter.</p>

<p>It has all that a winter enthusiast needs: Cafés &amp; <a href="http://www.tosilappi.fi/en/services/restaurants/">Restaurants</a>, various <a href="http://www.tosilappi.fi/en/accommodation/">accommodation options</a>, a supermarket and various other shops, the <a href="http://www.nationalparks.fi/felllaplandvisitorcentre">Fell Lapland Visitor Centre</a> and lots of stuff to do, from skiing on the local hill to enjoying the silence on a Husky Sled ride. With six days in Hetta we had plenty of time to try various <a href="http://www.tosilappi.fi/en/things-to-do/winter/">activities</a> and experience what the town has to offer.</p>

<h2 id="outside-with-hetta-huskies">Outside with Hetta Huskies</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.hettahuskies.com/en">Hetta Huskies</a> are probably one of the most well-known companies from Hetta, and if you meet the dogs, owners and Guides it is clear why: The dogs are lovely and will make your trip unforgettable, while the owners Pasi &amp; Anna with their friendly, international staff of Guides will ensure you have a great experience - be it just a few hours or a week!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26122490546/in/album-72157665518007630/" title="Hetta Huskies"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1550/26122490546_2d432ac709_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Hetta Huskies" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We were with the whole family - my four year old son, baby, wife and me - on the <a href="http://www.hettahuskies.com/en/activities/single-day-safaris">Silent Landscapes</a> Safari, in which you get a tour of the Farm, meet the dogs, get instructed on how to ride the sleigh and then are off into the winter wonderland for around 45 minutes. It’s was a great and interesting experience that we all enjoyed, especially our son thought it was a lot of fun (the baby slept!). We were accompanied by a guide who stayed mostly away but helped when the need arose - we had a small change in the configuration of dogs, for example. After I got instructed in riding the sleigh the family sat down and then we were off to the mires. I always love to explore swamps in winter, their vast area and wide views are beautiful to behold and in winter you can explore them without mosquitos and wet feet. We could see the distant fjells of the National Park, rode through the forest and loved the silence of nature. We could have gone much longer - and the dogs, too! - but after 45 minutes we were back at the farm where we helped bringing the dogs back to their compounds and said thanks for their great service!</p>

<h2 id="a-visit-to-the-hetta-snow-castle">A visit to the Hetta Snow Castle</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.nakkala.com">Näkkälä Eräpalvelut</a> offers visits to their Snow Castle which is a short 20 minute snowmobile ride over the frozen lake away from Hetta. The castle is open from the end of November and still stands there in the end of June and with walls several meters thick that’s no surprise! The kids loved it and it is easy to understand why they were fascinated by the ice castle: Consisting of three domed rooms they were adorned with ice sculptures, an ice bar and tables as well as a frozen bed! You can sleep in the ice castle, too! After exploring the snow castle for a while we had hot juice and then it was again back to Hetta in the sleigh. A great activity for the morning or afternoon after which you might find yourself again outside trying to build your own snow igloo!</p>

<h2 id="skiing-at-hetta-hiihtomaa">Skiing at Hetta Hiihtomaa</h2>

<p>If you <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hendrikm/">follow me on Instagram</a> you probably have realized that I have been ski-touring a lot this winter. <a href="http://www.hettahiihtomaa.fi">Hetta Hiihtomaa</a> is the local skiing hill and we took the chance for our son to learn a bit of skiing and I too took a ride in the lift up to go down through the snow-covered forest. The service at Hetta Hiihtomaa was superb, the two Gentlemen were super-friendly and helpful with <a href="http://www.hettahiihtomaa.fi/p/valinevuokraus.html">loaning the gear</a> and sharing local knowledge. Besides the lift and ski-rental there’s also a Café, a big sledding hill and a illuminated XC Loipe. The prizes are very affordable when compared to the large ski areas, and the people and kids all had a lot of fun on the slopes or off-piste. Hetta Hiihtomaa has also a small beginner’s hill which is excellent for learning to ski, and I can totally recommend the sledding hill, too! </p>

<h2 id="ski-touring-into-the-white--out-at-nkklvaara">Ski-touring into the White (-Out) at Näkkälävaara</h2>

<p>What I like more than skiing at a resort is going into the backcountry, and I was fortunate enough to go out for a morning with Riikka from <a href="http://www.wildriver.fi">Wild River Nature Adventures</a>. We decided it’d be a good idea to go to Näkkälä, a tiny village some 30 minutes from Hetta, where we’d tour up to the local fjell, Näkkälävaara. It’s an easy tour with a really cool descent through a birch forest and I had a huge smile on my face after the cool run down! </p>

<p>We started next to one of the few houses and then toured over a narrow lake to the foot of the fjell. It was a cold day and a mist was hanging in the air, which would before long engulf us as we started the climb up the hill. The visibility was soon just a couple dozen metre, and first as we were starting the descent the weather cleared a bit to give a few views price. Nevertheless it was beautiful to tour through the white landscape, with trees hidden under thick covers of snow &amp; ice, arctic hare tracks running across the hill and the wind being the only sound wide &amp; far. At the summit we waited for half an hour for the weather to clear, as you could see till Pyhäkero to the south and the mountains in Norway to the north, as well as the large Pöyrisjärvi lake. Alas, they stayed all hidden! </p>

<p>After the superb descent we skied along the lake, past the rental cabins of <a href="http://www.nakkala.com/kampat/">Näkkälä Eräpalvelut</a> and to a sacred rock of the Sami, which showed ancient reindeer paintings. Too soon we were back at the car and on our way back to Hetta, where we encountered many reindeer next to the road - and the sun also came out! There’s plenty of great ski-touring around Hetta, from the majestic Pyhäkero to smaller fjells in the area. Grab a map and go out explore!</p>

<h2 id="tasty-lappish-food">Tasty Lappish food</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.hetan-majatalo.fi/en">Hotel Hetan Majatalo</a> has every Friday a Lappish Buffet which is super-tasty. Reindeer, salmon, mashed potatoes and a tasty dessert along with a great home-brewed beer it is something you should treat yourself to. </p>

<p>Also the buffet at the Lapland Hotel Hetta was very tasty, with a wide variety of salads for startes, wish and meat mains and several sweet desserts. Add in a good selection of wines and beers with great service and you have a great evening!</p>

<h2 id="enjoying-the-silence-of-xc-skiing">Enjoying the silence of XC skiing</h2>

<p>As we stayed in a cottage next to the lake and there’s around 100 km of skiing tracks (here’s the <a href="http://www.tosilappi.fi/wp-content/uploads/Hetan-alueen-latukartta.pdf">map</a>) going XC skiing is something that you can do any time of the day - even at night, as there’s illuminated tracks, too! I took my son in a Pulka for a few hours of skiing along, which is a great way to be outdoors. XC skiing is relatively easy, you go at a low speed and thus still can experience the nature around you but it’s fast enough to feel good after a few hours outside. </p>

<h2 id="learning-about-sami-culture-at-the-fell-lapland-visitor-centre">Learning about Sami Culture at the Fell Lapland Visitor Centre</h2>

<p>If the weather is so bad that you don’t want to be outside, head to the wonderful <a href="http://www.nationalparks.fi/en/felllaplandvisitorcentre">Fell Lapland Visitor Centre</a>. It’s open every day of the week, has also a Café with tasty cakes and pastries and the exhibitions are free of charge - hence an ideal way to spend an afternoon. There’s even a very nice children’s corner which our son enjoyed playing at! The main exhibition shows the eight seasons of the Sámi and how their life has changed over the time. To take it all in a couple of hours would be needed I reckon, though it is easy to spend even more time there to also explore the small library and the two other exhibitions.</p>

<h2 id="more-things-to-see--do">More things to see &amp; do</h2>

<p>Hetta has many other things to offer, from festivals like the Nordic Ice &amp; Snow Sculpture competition at the end of February over regular Nature evenings in the Museum to the <a href="http://saamiskirace.fi">Saami Ski Race</a> in April. You can view the <a href="http://www.tosilappi.fi/en/events/">events</a> here. There’s also two silver smiths in Hetta which are worth checking out and a church which is architecturally interesting. It’s not far to Kilpisjärvi, either, or you could go for a day trip over to Alta in Norway. If you’re looking for a few days in nature you could ski from Pallas to Hetta through the fjells (or vice versa) and you even can ski onwards to Näkkälä. </p>

<p><strong>Where to stay?</strong></p>

<p>We stayed at the <a href="http://www.tosilappi.fi/en/ounistieva-en/">Ounistieva Cottage</a> which is a nice cottage a bit out of town right next to the lake. It’s a self-service cottage with a nice wood-heated sauna, a warm wood stove and you can go XC skiing from the doorstep, which is awesome. Cottages are great for families as you can be as loud as you want, the kids can play safely outside in the snow and there’s plenty of space inside. If you prefer something more central then we can recommend the <a href="http://www.hetan-majatalo.fi">Hotel Hetan Majatalo</a> and the <a href="https://www.laplandhotels.com/EN/hotels-in-lapland/hetta/lapland-hotel-hetta.html">Lapland Hotel Hetta</a> which are close to the centre of town and also have their own Restaurants with great food. Their rooms, especially in the Hetan Majatalo, are very cozy and it’s nice to have breakfast &amp; dinner served each evening. There’s several more <a href="http://www.tosilappi.fi/en/accommodation/">accommodation options in Hetta</a> for every budget, so have a look around and find what suits you!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26205520136/in/dateposted/" title="Ounistieva Cottage"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1617/26205520136_1638186cfb_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Ounistieva Cottage" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>How to get there?</strong></p>

<p>We travelled with a combination of <a href="https://www.vr.fi/cs/vr/fi/etusivu">train</a> and <a href="https://www.sixt.fi">car</a> instead of driving all the way up north, with a night in Rovaniemi on the way up and down - if you have small kids it is more comfortable this way, for everyone really. In the train the kids can play, nap and go easily to the toilet, and the ride from Rovaniemi to Hetta takes only around four hours by car - much better than the 12+ hours of driving it would take from Vaasa! And if you come from abroad - just fly straight to <a href="https://www.finavia.fi/en/enontekio/">Enontekiö Airport</a>! </p>

<p>Winter, also known to parents as the time where you need to get ready 15 minutes before you plan to leave - because your little ones need help dressing up in the multitude of layers we make them wear so they do not get cold. Because only when they’re not cold they actually enjoy being outdoors (much like adults, really). We tested the <a href="https://marmot.com/products/details/boys-space-walk-jacket">Marmot Space Walk Jacket</a> and <a href="https://marmot.com/products/details/boys-edge-insulated-pant">Edge Insulated Pants</a> during the last four months outside while alpine skiing, sledding, building snowmen and XC skiing, and here are our thoughts about them.</p>

<h2 id="space-walk-jacket">Space Walk Jacket</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.marmot.de/content/de/collection_26&amp;c=643&amp;show=5778">Space Walk Jacket</a> in Size XS equals size 110 and weighs 512 g. Our son loved the colour combination of orange and reds, and we too really liked it. Outside a waterproof &amp; breathable Marmot MemBrain® Fabric keeps snow and moisture at bay, while on the inside a Thermal R 100 g insulation ensures generated warmth stays inside. The hood is removable, and a really good fit, even over a bobble hat. The Powder Skirt keeps the snow out and is extremely useful for little skiers and playing in the snow. It has a silicone band on the inside which keeps it in place and has two levels of tightness. In the back, chin and neck a fleece lining makes it comfortable against the skin and likely helps with breathability, too. What we found overkill were the six pockets, we could have done easily with only the one large mesh pocket on the inside (which is great to store beanie, neck warmer and gloves!) and one of the outside pockets. Our son never used the Velcro hand pockets nor the other two pockets on the outside. The hem is adjustable, though with the toggles in the pockets it is difficult to do so - happily we never needed it. The sleeves have Velcro closures and also can be adjusted, and most importantly are wide enough so gloves can be worn underneath the sleeves to keep the snow out. The jacket closes high and our son found the area in the front of the face constricting, something we solved by leaving the zipper always a couple of centimetre open.</p>

<p>In terms of warmth, we feel the jacket (and pants for that matter) are warm till -10°C with a thin midlayer on (plus normal clothes), probably more with a thicker midlayer. The jacket has plenty of space underneath for layering, and our son never was cold in a variety of activities and weather conditions. It gives little skiers and climbers great freedom of movement, and the Powder Skirt ensures no cold and wet snow comes inside. After four months of use and a couple of washes the jacket also still looks like new, also at high-stress areas like the cuffs and back. Overall our son really liked his Space Walk Jacket - it is warm, has nice colours and is easy for him to put on and off on his own. </p>

<h2 id="edge-insulated-pants">Edge Insulated Pants</h2>

<p>In size XS the <a href="http://www.marmot.de/content/de/collection_26&amp;c=647&amp;show=5792">Edge Insulated Pants</a> weighs 444 g. They are, as the name suggests, insulated pants, made of the proprietary Marmot MemBrain® fabric on the outside which makes the pants water-resistant, while on the inside a Thermal R™ insulation keeps little winter lovers warm. We found the internal flex boot gaiters great to keep shoes &amp; socks dry from the inside, and the reinforced inside leg is useful for skiing as well as scrambling on rocks. The waist is adjustable via Velcros on the inside, but sadly the adjustment is only minimal - we feel a bit more adjustment in width or a stretchy waist could have been better and would possibly make it possible to use the pants two winter seasons. The removable suspenders are great, and the soft inside lining makes it easy to put the pants on over other pants. We never used the three pockets on the pants, so maybe it’d make sense to get rid of at least the two zippered pockets. </p>

<p>Putting the pants on is easy thanks to the smooth lining and it stays well in place with the adjustable suspenders and button closure. After four months of daily use outside the Edge Insulated Pants still looks like new after a couple of washes. The Marmot MemBrain® fabric kept the snow &amp; wetness always reliable outside and it was easy to brush dirt off the pants. They allow for great freedom of movement, be it scrambling up the snow hills along the streets, climbing on the playground or Alpine and XC skiing. The sizing is good for kids between 108 and 112 cm, though if your child is wearing more than one baselayer the waist might get tight (we just left the button open). Asides from these little things from us parents our son simply liked his Edge Insulated Pants a lot: They were toasty, allowed him to go sledding on his pants down steep snow hills and also looked cool!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In late February and early March I made a visit to Switzerland to attempt the Graubünden Haute Route. Sadly the high avalanche danger and changing weather cut us short - here’s a first taste of four days ski-touring in Graubünden.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25455047716/in/album-72157665020355632/" title="Going down."><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1445/25455047716_5a5b16aa20_b.jpg" width="1024" height="684" alt="Going down." /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.hauteroute-graubuenden.ch">Graubünden Haute Route</a> is a five days/ four nights ski-touring trip where you visit four beautiful huts, ski great powder, test your mountaineering skills while climbing some beautiful peaks and enjoy great scenary. Well, that’s at least the normal plan, but because of not really good weather and high avalanche danger our trip was cut a wee bit short. Stay tuned for a full day-to-day account of my Haute Route experience, but for now enjoy these fine selection of photos! </p>

<p>Day one we skied from Madulain to the D’Es-Cha Hut, where we spent in the end two nights because we didn’t want to risk our lives in highly dangerous avalanche terrain. It’s a beautiful hut with great wardens, a wide selection of board and card games as well as interesting magazines - so we didn’t get bored while waiting for better weather.</p>

<p>Reto, the warden, welcomed us in heinous winds to his hut with a very taste cup of hot, sweet tea. His wife Ursina cooked us a delicious dinner and we slept great - ready for our fourth day, with high hopes of better weather yet again.</p>

<h2 id="norr">NORR</h2>

<p>I have been writing for <a href="http://www.norrmagazin.de">NORR</a> on and off since five years and was really happy as they asked me to help them create the Special issue within the magazine on Finland. Not only has NORR some of the greatest design &amp; layout which you also will find in this issue, the stories in it too are always inspiring and fascinating. From a visit of Tove Jansson’s island to paddling the coast of Finland, there’s plenty in this magazine which will make Finland Lovers jump with excitement into the air! <a href="http://www.norrmagazin.de/einzelhefte/">Order your issue here</a> or be smart and <a href="http://www.norrmagazin.de/abonnement/">take out a subscription for a year</a>!</p>

<p>It’s always great to be able to write for some UK publications, and I was really excited to write about <a href="http://www.oe-mag.co.uk/imag/oemarchapril2016/files/36.html">Via Ferratas</a> for the current Outdoor Enthusiast Magazine. It’s a free online Magazine and well worth checking out, with articles from trail running in North Pembrokeshire to thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail with my mate <a href="http://www.keithfoskett.com">Keith Foskett</a>.</p>

<p>For the spring issue of the <a href="http://www.biketravel-magazin.com">Bike &amp; Travel Magazine</a> I wrote about alternative ways to carry your gear - with the great Micropanniers from <a href="http://www.porcelainrocket.com">Porcelain Rocket</a> and the <a href="http://ovejanegrathreadworks.com/index.html">Oveja Negra Threadworks</a> Frame Halfbags.

<p><a href="http://www.dein-finnland.de/">Dein Finnland</a> is a new Magazine from Visit Finland and I was very happy to contribute a piece to the inaugral issue about my love for the coast of Finland. <a href="http://www.dein-finnland.de/kuestenleben-kuestenliebe/">Küstenleben - Küstenliebe</a> is the name of that piece, it’s free to read online and you should definitely keep an eye on this magazine, which has some beautiful stories in it!</p>

<p>I like an active start to my days, so whenever possible I like to get up before dawn and head out to watch the sun rise outside. In winter this is easier because the sun doesn’t rise until 9 o’clock or later, but of course it is a lot colder outside - like on this morning, where it was -19°C outside when I took my Fatbike to watch the sun rise out on a frozen lake: </p>

<p>As I skip breakfast in the mornings to not wake up the kids I usually just fill up one of my bottles with some tasty juice, as it gives more energy than plain water and does taste better - coffee and a smoothie I enjoy then when I’m back home after a nice morning ride and lots of motivation for my work day! </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Remember your roots,</strong> they say. Our roots are in ultralight backpacking. We have spread the gospel about ultralight backpacking since a long time, have <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/interviews/">interviewed cottage manufacturers</a> and used a lot of ultralight kit on our hikes and treks. And even when I nowadays am attending the big outdoor trade fairs like <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/02/ispo-2016-news-iii.html">ISPO</a> and <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/outdoor-fair-2015/">OutDoor</a>, it’s the new gear from the cottages that I am most excited about. And so <a href="http://hrxxlight.com">Benjamin</a> and me again set out to ask Cottage Manufacturers about the new gear they have been developing, prototyping and testing in the last months and are now ready to release to you. So here we are, and we wish you a lot of fun checking out the <strong>New Gear from the Cottages 2016</strong>!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/13912268942/in/album-72157644166894052/" title="MLD TrailStar in the English Lake District."><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2900/13912268942_8066e0cef6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="MLD TrailStar in the English Lake District." /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><em>Disclaimer: The information in this article are directly from the cottages. I haven’t seen nor tested this equipment, it rather is a showcase of all the new gear the cottages have been developing over the last months and year. I’m not paid for it, if you like it <a href="http://bit.ly/1HGCWMS">buy me a coffee or two</a>.</em></p>

<h2 id="tschum">Tschum</h2>

<p><a href="https://tschum.de">Tschum</a> is the name of the traditional housings of some Siberian natives, similar to the Lávvu and the Kota, and the name of Germany’s newest cottage. Born from the owners wish for a small two person fire tent, that is light enough to compete with modern trekking tents, he came up with the Tschum 2p. After one year of prototyping and testing, the production started in January 2016. Their tents are completely handmade in Germany. They have a <a href="https://tschum.de/index.php?route=product/category&amp;path=77_78">transparent cost structure</a>, and <a href="https://tschum.de/index.php?route=product/category&amp;path=77_79">share their designs</a> on their website.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24885667599/in/dateposted/" title="Tschum 04"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1629/24885667599_b4bbf4fc00_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Tschum 04" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>As usual in cottages, every single tent is manufactured one at a time to the customers needs and order. After a final quality control the Tschum is labeled and signed by its creator, so it is possible for you to speak to exactly the person who built your entire tent. You know that means you will have to wait for them doing the job, which normally takes them about four weeks. The „Tschums“ are highly customizable, with many options and materials available - Feel free to ask them for more infos. </p>

<p>We also offer different <a href="https://tschum.de/index.php?route=product/category&amp;path=62">firebowls</a> and stoves that match the Tschum. And currently they are working on a 4P version and are experimenting with ultralight materials.</p>

<h2 id="laufbursche-gear">LAUFBURSCHE Gear</h2>

<p>I’m sad that I need to share these <a href="http://www.laufbursche-gear.de/news">news about LAUFBURSCHE</a> with you, but Mateusz was diagnosed with cancer and now will go through the difficult and hard process of healing. If you’re pondering about how you could help him in this difficult time please keep an eye on his website and this <a href="http://www.ultraleicht-trekking.com/forum/topic/3504-schulterschluss-für-mateusz/">thread on the Ultraleicht Forum</a>. Backpacks will obviously not be made &amp; sold for the time being, but you could still purchase any of the other <a href="http://www.laufbursche-gear.de/products/">ultralight equipment</a> he sells.</p>

<h2 id="mountain-laurel-designs">Mountain Laurel Designs</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.mountainlaureldesigns.com">Mountain Laurel Designs</a> has some big things coming in 2016. Mountain Laurel Designs’ new 2016 Pro SilNyon is in stock and shipping. It is 30% stronger, 15% lighter and has 3X the waterproofness vs older versions. The WP is well above 5,000mm and this new coating will dramatically increase overall performance, durability and longevity of our shelters in the harshest conditions.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24957719220/in/dateposted/" title="MLD 7000mm"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1695/24957719220_b9ae18eea0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="690" alt="MLD 7000mm" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>MLD’s entire pack line is now available in a Cuben Fiber/ Dyneema Composite Fabric option. These packs are lighter weight and are fully taped for waterproofness.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24622682964/in/dateposted/" title="MLD"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1707/24622682964_47a8642c0f_b.jpg" width="735" height="1024" alt="MLD" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The FKT (Fastest Known Time) gear line is growing and includes a Pack, Quilt, Cuben eVENT Bivy and Shelter. Designed for speed hikes and special Outdoor Missions this equipment is SUL. The Quilt and Bivy are already out and the <a href="http://www.mountainlaureldesigns.com/shop/product_info.php?products_id=228">FKT Bivy</a> won an Award from the TGO magazine. It’s the lightest full-feature waterproof Bivy Sack available. It uses a Dyneema Non-Woven (Cuben Fiber) eVENT top and a Dyneema NonWoven Bottom.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25227064736/in/dateposted/" title="MLD FKT Soul headend"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1457/25227064736_dc254604d6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="983" alt="MLD FKT Soul headend" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.mountainlaureldesigns.com/shop/product_info.php?cPath=52&amp;products_id=227">Quilt</a> is similar to the MLD Spirit Quilt and has 2X the insulation on the lower part for fast moving hikers and runners who pack less lower body daytime insulation but need that at night. And the pack will be similar in size and design to the Burn with new features for fast moving adventures, with a late February Release. The shelter on the other hand is a secret still and should be out in late February or March.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25160162661/in/dateposted/" title="MLD 2016 Supermid"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1489/25160162661_e40ed2bd9d_b.jpg" width="864" height="569" alt="MLD 2016 Supermid" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The 2016 SuperMid comes in the new SilNylon with extra guy line points in case you want to take it out in galeforce winds. Also all other MLD Pyramids now have updated larger peak vents. The DuoMid XL, as the SuperMid, has additional guyout points on the main ridgelines for really rough weather. There is also a larger SuperMid Mondo for larger groups because our new stronger silnylon make larger Mids possible. All Mids will also have a snow skirt custom option.</p>

<p>If you like cuben (or whatever Dyneema fancies calling it nowadays) the MLD .75 Cuben Fiber/ Dyneema Composite Fabric shelters now have a color option. The standard light green and the new lower cost .75  white option, with a few shelters also having an even lighter .5 cuben fiber fabric option.</p>

<p>Finally, production changes at MLD means they will offer a much shorter wait times versus previous years! So if you want a FKT bivy for that next trip - give Ron a call! </p>

<h2 id="hanchor">Hanchor</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.hanchor.com">HANCHOR</a> is planning to release 3 backpacks with their Two-track suspension system, a minimalist small backpack, and all new built-in chalk sock chalk bag and chalk bucket. </p>

<p>The Two Track Suspension in a Nutshell: The Shoulder straps connect all the way to the back creating a ventilated back panel and providing basic support for a frame less mode in a weight saving way. Two vertical and one lateral aluminum stay can be inserted to stay in the same piece of back panel and add the stability of the suspension system in a weight saving way. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24644025573/in/dateposted/" title="Hanchor Two Track Suspension"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1660/24644025573_47d126fa6d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="1024" alt="Hanchor Two Track Suspension" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>New is the Xeno Ultralight open basket backpack. Think <a href="http://bit.ly/1Q6XotU">ULA Epic</a> gone lightweight. It is 741 g with the removable hipbelt and sternum strap, the vertical aluminum and lateral aluminum stays add 114 g and 31 g respecively. It is made from TPU laminated Cordura 420d, Cordura 100d and Xpac vx21, has 50 l volume and the Two-Track ventilated suspension system. 2 long daisy chains and two gear loops on the hip belt let you strap on kit, and it is compatible with a dry bag up to 50 l so you can separate your kit. A durable mesh fabric at bottom drains water, which makes the Xeno well-suited for for river climbing, canyoneering, and wet weather condition climbing or backpacking.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24640188984/in/dateposted/" title="Hanchor Xeno"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1524/24640188984_d898967f01_b.jpg" width="1024" height="1024" alt="Hanchor Xeno" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Flint is a simple-designed ultralight climbing backpack with 42 l Volume and is made from Xpac vx21 and Cordura 100d. Again the Two-Track ventilated suspension system is along, which makes this pack 866 g light with the removable hipbelt and sternum strap. And again the vertical aluminum and lateral aluminum stays add 114 g and 31 g respecively, with two long daisy chains, two gear loops on the hip belt and two axe loops to store equipment. The roll-top closure and compression straps help to compress the volume, and the bottom seam binding make this pack easily stand on the ground.</p>

<h2 id="enlightened-equipment">Enlightened Equipment</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.enlightenedequipment.com">Enlightened Equipment</a> is in the process of moving to a huge new facility, and once that is done they will have a full time product development team to dream up new ways to sleep toasty warm. </p>

<p>Additionally they recently added 950fp down as an option for all down quilt options. As you know, that is a great choice for those who need the smallest possible pack size (bikepackers love the compressibility!) and lowest weight, and they are also offering DownTek™ water repellent down as an additional protection against moisture.</p>

<p>Recently launched is the <a href="http://www.enlightenedequipment.com/convert/">Convert</a>. The quilt sizes up the award-winning Revelation, adds a full-length draft-blocked zipper and is sized up to allow a very spacious sleeping bag/ quilt hybrid that is very comfortable, especially for side and stomach sleepers. The drawcord footbox makes adapting to warmer weather quick and simple, and if it’s warmer still, just unzip it all the way and use it as a flat blanket.</p>

<h2 id="katabatic-gear">Katabatic Gear</h2>

<p><a href="http://katabaticgear.com/">Katabatic Gear</a> added a new line of sleeping bags which they are very excited about. Their customers demanded a blanket-style quilt and so they delivered: The <a href="http://katabaticgear.com/flex-sleeping-bags/">Flex Series</a>, which is available in 40°, 30°, 22°, and 15° options, as well as five different sizes. The Flex quilts are designed with the award-winning features you have come to expect from them, like the Katabatic attachment system, a down filled collar and draft blocking foot box closure which guards from the cold. But when you need some ventilation, the zippered foot box allows you to completely open the quilt up to a blanket, which makes for a truly flexible sleep system.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.packrafting-store.de">Packrafting Store</a> remains dedicated to the concept of amphibious travel and in 2016 you will see further diversification and the new accessories from them and Anfibio.</p>

<p>First off is their <a href="http://www.packrafting-store.de/Paddle/Multi-paddle/Anfibio-Ultimate-Multi::631.html?XTCsid=vatldvbj78v3lmqc5mkso3dr85">Anfibio Ultimate in a Multi version</a>, the lightest collapsible canoeing paddle around at ~470 g.  </p>

Soon they also hope to launch the “YAMA Labs” as a way to foster product development; which is partly a behind the scenes look at product development and partly a demo and testing opportunity. Cool!</p>

With these packs they’ve done a lot of fine tuning based upon user feedback and so far all the changes have been well received. SMD has also added a new pack to the lineup, the <a href="https://www.sixmoondesigns.com/packs/Flex.html?redirected=1">Flex</a>, which provides a lot of flexibility for those carrying odd loads. Ron want you to know that there won’t be big changes in the shelters for the coming year.</p>

<h2 id="qiwiznet">QiWiz.net</h2>

<p><a href="http://qiwiz.net">QiWiz UL Gear</a> is best known for their titanium cathole trowels, but also make and sell titanium wood burning stoves, ultralight buck saws, titanium spatulas, and other ultralight cooking options. </p>

<p>Rob’s biggest news for 2016 is that he is no longer a one-person operation. After the last 4 years of rapid growth, demand for the Big Dig and other sizes of <a href="http://qiwiz.net/trowels.html">titanium cathole trowels</a> has gotten to the point that he has hired a member of his backpacking club to help me with production.

<p>A nice design improvement for the FireFly ultralight titanium wood burning stoves has recently been introduced. They have added a vertical crease in the top half of each stove side for a 3-D shape that adds greater strength with no weight penalty. Rob is really happy that he has even been able to do this with the FlexPort side that allows the user to feed longer sticks into the firebox. The pictures below show the new creased sides next to the previous design that was flat. </p>

<h2 id="locus-gear">Locus Gear</h2>

<p><a href="http://locusgear.com/?lang=en">Locus Gear</a> will possibly release a modified version of their popular Khufu CTF3 called Khufu CTF3-B this spring or early summer. As Jotaro is still testing it no exact release date has been decided yet. The shape itself is almost the same as the normal version of the Khufu CTF3, but as you can notice ,there is a letter “B” at the end of the name - which stands for advanced bonding technique so that there is no seam line at the main structure except around the zipper. Even the seam line around the zipper is taped over by the same bonding technique as an additional reinforcement. This all means you don’t have to apply seam sealing. Additionally there is a modified air vent and more new innovations in this shelter, so keep an eye out for it! </p>

<p>Secondly, Locus Gear will release a new foam sleeping mat called “Onda” in the spring. The mat has a patented unique waved foam surface combined with a thin flat foam base. The weight is about 250 g in the size of 180 cm x 50 cm x 1 cm! </p>

<p><a href="http://zpacks.com">ZPacks</a> offers a freestanding modification to their Duplex tent for a while, the <a href="http://zpacks.com/shelter/duplex-flex.shtml">Duplex Flex Tent</a>. Some “beta” customers have taken it outside already and have provided feedback thus far. Additionally, ZPAcks has moved to a larger building (again) in November and have been hiring a bunch of seamsters to help them meet demand this spring! </p>

<p>Cottage Manufacturers are busy people - some are just now out hiking, other’s are finishing up your gear. That’s why not every cottage is on this list. It’s a living document, though, and likely will be updated a couple of times during the next few weeks while more companies are added. Either check back at the end of the week or follow along on <a href="http://facebook.com/hikinginfinland">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hendrikmorkel">Twitter</a> where I will announce updates.
