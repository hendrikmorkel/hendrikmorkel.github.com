<p>2015 was the 4th <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/07/arcteryx-alpine-academy-2014.html">Arc’teryx Alpine Academy</a> overall and my second one. I was lucky enough to be invited as a member of the Press this year so got a sneak peak at the cool new gear that will come next year from Arc’teryx, and like everyone got the chance to hang out with the athletes, try out cool gear from Arc’teryx, Petzl, Scarpa, MSR and LYO Food and have a great time in Chamonix with the other participants. Here’s a re-cap of the three clinics I visited, which should be interesting if you’re considering to visit the Arc’teryx Academy in 2016!</p>

<h2 id="glacier-preparation-clinic">Glacier Preparation Clinic</h2>

<p>I haven’t been to Mer de Glace last year so decided that the <a href="http://chamonix.arcteryxacademy.com/shop/a-beginners/clinic-03-glacier-preparation-clinic/">Glacier Preparation Clinic</a> would be a good start for the weekend in Chamonix. The Mer de Glace is also only at about 1.900 m height which makes for easier acclimatisation, which worked well for me - last year I went straight up to 3.800 m, and living at sea level that’s quite a bit of difference. </p>

<p>Our group of four were with BMG and IFMGA Mountain Guide <a href="http://stuartmacdonald.org/">Stuart MacDonald</a> which was a great guy which explained us four everything we needed to know about walking on a Glacier. After taking the train up to the Grand Hotel Du Montevers we walked to the ladders and started the descent down to the Glacier. It’s an interesting thing, as less than 150 years ago you could walk onto the Glacier from where you embark the train - climate change is showing its ugly face here, and it will be interesting to see how much more the glacier will retreat.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19046370865" title="Grand Hotel Montevers Hotel by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/474/19046370865_4085701c4a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Grand Hotel Montevers Hotel" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18861943339" title="Down the ladders by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/432/18861943339_3cebe64d02_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Down the ladders" /></a>

<p>Once you’re down the ladders you walk over the moraine till you’re at the proper glacier. Here Stuart explained us how to put on our crampons and how to walk normally in them, which we did for a bit. Then we moved on to learn more crampon techniques, front pointing, and how to use our ice axe. If you haven’t used these ever before its a good clinic to get to know the basics, so that you can do for example glacier hikes in the future.</p>

<p>After that we went to a steep section where a glacial river has carved a deep gorge into the ice, set up anchors and started to first walk steep ice up, and then ice climb it. The latter exercise was great fun, as we went from two ice tools to one ice tool to no ice tool, which taught you about proper foot placement and keeping your balance. This was the most fun part for me and I could have done it all afternoon long. Alas, we wanted to catch the 15 o’clock train down so after everyone made a lap down and up we started the walk back to the train station. </p>

<h2 id="advanced-alpine-techniques">Advanced Alpine Techniques</h2>

<p>The Arête des Cosmiques has been on my Tick List for a long time, and I was a bit jealous when my mate did it last year in his Technical Mountaineering course while we did the Pointes Lachenal Traverse. Waking up on Saturday morning after maybe one Génépi too much I was sure that today I’d be going on the Cosmiques, and lo and behold: As I arrived punctually at the Aiguille du Midi base station <a href="http://www.chamonix-guides.eu/Trombinoscope/251/contact/jean_villard_guides/23-trombinoscope.htm">Jean Villard</a> told me with a smile that the weather is so good that he thinks we should do the Cosmiques today, because we can learn &amp; practice all the techniques on it that we should do in our <a href="http://chamonix.arcteryxacademy.com/shop/c-advanced/clinic-06-sat-adv-tech-alpinism/">Advanced Alpine Techniques clinic</a>. We drove up in the first Gondola and met the two other clients who slept the night up on the glacier, roped up and started the approach to the Arête des Cosmiques. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19053159461" title="The start of the Arête des Cosmiques by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/421/19053159461_dfe9b0da84_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="The start of the Arête des Cosmiques" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19049953765" title="Jean Villard preparing the rope by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/559/19049953765_bf34d4de11_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Jean Villard preparing the rope" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19044428282" title="Blue-Bird weather by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/476/19044428282_6f2375c22a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Blue-Bird weather" /></a></p>

<p>At the Abri Simond hut we untied, roped up again and started up the route. It starts off with easy snow &amp; ice covered slabs which we protected with an occasional friend. At the Gendarme then came the first abseil, which had me a bit nervous - wrongly, though. Then it are a few more steps to the 2nd abseil, where you need to squeeze yourself backwards through a narrow chimney, which again was somehow feeling a bit dodgy to me, but again was no problem. After that followed some easy traversing to the 2nd tower, where we passed the <a href="http://www.chamonixtopo.com/digital-crack-aiguille-du-midi">Digital Crack</a>, the highest 8a in Europe. It looked like a beautiful line and should I ever reach that level, I’m sure to try it. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19023712866" title="Scrambling by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/520/19023712866_9dcd627ea1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Scrambling" /></a>

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19053150951" title="1st Rappel by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/400/19053150951_91b1417a73_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="1st Rappel" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18427455014" title="2nd Rappel by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3931/18427455014_fb2865d367_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="2nd Rappel" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18863788749" title="Into the clouds by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/343/18863788749_d1a01da13c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Into the clouds" /></a>

<p>But our climbing, at a much lower grade, was coming: The 4a Crux pitch. Jean free soloed it up without problems - he probably does that route a dozen times per year, and he’s already very long a Mountain Guide! - and then we followed. It was very easy even with crampons on, so even if you’re not a climber this shouldn’t have you worried in my opinion. As we were the first rope team on the route that day and we lost our pursuers after the first rappel we had a leisurely lunch on top of the Crux pitch, enjoyed the Alpine Choughs which were sailing above us and the beautiful sunshine. </p>

<p>After the nice break we continued onto the North Face of the route, and it got a wee bit colder in the shadow. But the scrambling over large boulders and through chimneys kept us warm enough until we reached the final plateau before the Aiguille du Midi cable car station. I had Georg, Johannes and Jean walk up to a pillar to take a few photos, and the people on the view platform went completely mad =) As we climbed the wee ladder up we were welcomed like celebrities and had our photos taken with strangers!</p>

<p>It was a four hour round trip for us four (three clients, one Guide) with one long break for lunch, if you go alone or just two you probably can do it in a couple of hours or less - when there’s not a lot of people on the route, as it is very popular! It definitely is worth a visit, as it is a very scenic route that’s great to practice alpine climbing and mountaineering skills.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19049977945" title="Arrived! by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/474/19049977945_ff89f288f0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Arrived!" /></a></p>

<h2 id="bigwall-climbing">Bigwall Climbing</h2>

<p>Sunday and <a href="http://chamonix.arcteryxacademy.com/shop/c-advanced/clinic-19-sun-big-wall-climbing/">Bigwall Climbing</a> was a great combination. The Bigwall Climbing clinic was new this year and very popular, and I think for a good reason: With a Client to Athlete to Guide Ratio of 3:1:1 it’s a fantastic clinic to learn new skills, ask a lot of questions and practice a lot. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18863698930" title="On the way to the Gongola by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/562/18863698930_34a87765fc_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="On the way to the Gongola" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19025173796" title="Bigwall Clinic group by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3746/19025173796_f7399d1035_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Bigwall Clinic group" /></a></p>

<p>The Bigwall Climbing consisted of four stations: The Portaledge Station, Jumaring, and two Aid Climbing stations - one with friends and nuts, the other with pitons and skyhooks. Because of time constraints I only got to try the first three, but on the plus side I was able to practice how to ascend the rope with some of my own gear (<a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/wild-country-ropeman-mk2f-steigklemme/">Ropeman 2</a> + <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/petzl-micro-traxion-seilrolle/?pid=81">Micro Traxion</a> in case you’re wondering). <a href="https://www.facebook.com/marcandreclimb">Marc-André Leclerc</a> showed us how to jumar the traditional way, with two <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.co.uk/petzl-ascension-ascender/">Jumars</a> and <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.co.uk/black-diamond-alpine-aiders-ladder/">Aider Ladders</a>. It was interesting to try this, as it always looks so easy in movies, but until you have found out the rhythm it wasn’t as easy as it looks!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18428873064" title="Marc-André explaining how to jumar by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3777/18428873064_d2a06da4f9_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Marc-André explaining how to jumar" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/19025176476" title="Me jumaring by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/366/19025176476_7e9f1d6c4c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Me jumaring" /></a>

<p>After that <a href="http://arcteryx.com/Athlete.aspx?EN/PaulMcSorley">Paul McSorley</a> showed us how to set up a Portaledge Camp, keep the camp in order and haul gear up. It was super interesting and as Paul has slept a few nights in Portaledges it was cool to hear his stories and tips on how to camp comfortably on a Bigwall. Sleeping on a Portaledge in Yosemite is high on my list, and this clinic certainly has me psyched to make that dream come true some day soon.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18865219979" title="&quot;And that&#x27;s how you keep things tidy&quot; by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/316/18865219979_96ac17bd8d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="&quot;And that&#x27;s how you keep things tidy&quot;" /></a>

<p>And then we went Aid Climbing. <a href="http://www.bigwall.ch/">Pesche Wüthrich</a> explained Hayden and me the ins and outs, and then we both scaled the crack on aid. Slowly. Because Aid Climbing, we learned, needs a lot of time. You place gear, clip in the ladder and Daisy Chain, slowly weigh it to see if it holds, then clip in your Fiffi hook, and repeat. The route we climbed was a super easy crack which we probably could have climbed half a dozen times without Aid gear on lead, but this was a cool way to try it out and learn about it. The beauty/ attractiveness of it is certainly that you can climb safely on your own.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>I arrived Thursday morning and left Sunday afternoon, but happily would have stayed a bit longer in this fine Alpine Climbing &amp; Mountaineering Playground. My 2nd Arc’teryx Alpine Academy was again a lot of fun &amp; very inspirational, where I met great people, learned new skills, and got to climb in Europe’s best alpine climbing destination. What made me very happy was that there were a lot of people from all skill levels who decided to come to the <a href="https://instagram.com/explore/tags/arcteryxacademy/">#ArcteryxAcademy</a> to learn mountaineering and climbing skills. I shared the rope with hillwalkers from the UK &amp; Malaysia, aspiring mountaineers from Austria and Bigwall Climbers from the USA, Canada and France, and met old friends from across the globe. </p>

<p>Again I can only recommend aspiring mountaineers and alpinists as well as backpackers &amp; hikers who’d like to up their skills to visit the <a href="http://chamonix.arcteryxacademy.com/">Arc’teryx Alpine Academy</a>. This year there were less people which in my opinion improved the learning and safety on the mountains, and made the groups more cozy &amp; personal, with more time for asking questions and trying techniques. The price-to-quality ratio still is superb, and if you consider all the free stuff available - the <a href="http://chamonix.arcteryxacademy.com/movie-night/">Movie Night</a>, the interesting <a href="http://chamonix.arcteryxacademy.com/seminar-night/">Seminars</a> and the <a href="http://chamonix.arcteryxacademy.com/demo-gear/">Demo Gear</a> - it really is very affordable. I certainly will keep a weekend free for next year for the 5th Arc’teryx Alpine Academy - if you’re smart, you’ll too! </p>

If it’s a good choice for your 3-season backpacking trips you read in my review.</p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.phdesigns.co.uk/minix-down-primaloft-sleeping-bag">PHD Minix Sleeping Bag</a> arrived last year May and has been used on several trips since, like my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/11/bouldering-on-aland.html">climbing roadtrip in Finland</a> and backpacking on the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/01/hogakustenleden-the-high-coast-trail.html">Högakustenleden</a>.</p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>The Minix is a sleeping bag, and so it’s function is to keep you warm while you sleep outdoors. </p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>PHD has this to say about the Minix:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Water-resistant Ultrashell outer (40 g/ m²)</li>
  <li>Primaloft Gold insulation on the base to handle damp &amp; maximise insulation under compression</li>
  <li>Box wall construction on top to maximise down loft</li>
  <li>900 fillpower European goose down</li>
  <li>Superlight MX inner (32 g/ m²)</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18199309079" title="PHD Minix Sleeping Bag bottom &amp; top by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/289/18199309079_157412966a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="PHD Minix Sleeping Bag bottom &amp; top" /></a></p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>PHD uses high-quality fabrics - a water-resistant outer, a box-wall construction for the 900 cuin down and Primaloft Gold - to create a ultralight sleeping bag. There’s also not many sleeping bags available that have a synthetic bottom and down on top - a smart way to use these two insulation materials.</p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>I own a few garments and the Minix from PHD and they are really of a superb quality. All of them are hand made in the UK, from the best and most functional materials. That quality has its price, but you’ll get many years of use out of them.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18197780400" title="PHD Minix Sleeping Bag Bottom by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7750/18197780400_0e075a9a30_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="PHD Minix Sleeping Bag Bottom" /></a></p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>The Minix I have - it’s the 2014 model which has a different colour than the 2015 one, otherwise they’re the same - weighs 575 g in Standard length, with the stuff sack tipping the scales at 25 g.</p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p>I really like using the Minix. While it needed some time to get used to the restricted movement that a sleeping bag offers, and that you only can get in via the top, once inside it was warm and comfy to sleep in. PHD gives the Minix a Comfort rating of 0°C and I can confirm that. With a T-shirt on the Minix kept me warm till 0°C, but once there was just some light minus degrees I immediately was cold in the sleeping bag. So for early spring and autumn trips you might want to take an extra baselayer along to sleep warm in the Minix, for all other times when the temperatures stay warm you can sleep just in your shirt and underwear in the Minix.</p>

<p>If it gets too warm - for me that’s +10°C and over - the Minix was very hot and I would start to perspire. This meant I would either pull the sleeping bag down to my waist to cool off or get completely out of the bag and just use it as a blanket over me, which allowed me to also leave a leg out to cool down. The Minix is very wide above so using it as a blanket worked well for me when laying on my back. I think the sleeping bag is ideal for temperatures between +1°C and +9°C, if it goes under 0°C you want to wear something in it, and if it goes over 10°C I do run to warm in it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18387090991" title="PHD Minix Hood Open by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/540/18387090991_edecbec72d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="PHD Minix Hood Open" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18381395682" title="PHD Minix Hood Closed by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/438/18381395682_1677d102c2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="PHD Minix Hood Closed" /></a></p>

<p>The freedom of movement inside of the sleeping bag is good, too. Because the Minix does not have a collar and just one drawstring to close the hole there’s not anything in the way on top, which makes turning around inside of the bag easy. The foot box was big enough for my size 42 feet and I also could lay in comfort on my side inside of the bag. </p>

<p>The Minix comes with a mesh storage bag and a 2 l stuff sack, the latter is great and well-suited for the bag but for the mesh bag I would prefer something larger from organic cotton. I have used the Minix with and without a bivy and with a bivy you have the added benefit of a mosquito protection and a few degrees more warmth. The Minix packs nice and small and lofts very quickly at camp. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17764852993" title="PHD Minix Footbox by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/277/17764852993_dd73e687ed_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="PHD Minix Footbox" /></a></p>

<h2 id="could-be-better">Could be better</h2>

<p>A small pocket for the drawstring on top would be great, I hate straps flying around my head and a pocket where I can stuff the drawstring in would take it out of the way and add just a couple of gram of weight. I’m also wondering if a light zipper down one side would be of benefit, while this would add quite a bit of weight it would make it easier to get in to the sleeping bag and also venting would be improved. </p>

<p>Finally, I wonder if the concept of the Minix - synthetic bottom and down top - would not be a great idea for a quilt. It would lose the hood most likely, but freedom of movement and venting would be improved a lot, and it even should be able to be lighter.</p>

<h2 id="competing-products">Competing Products</h2>

<p>If I just think about sleeping bags then the <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/mountain-hardwear-hyperlamina-spark-kunstfaserschlafsack/">Mountain Hardwear Hyperlamina Spark</a>, the <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/montane-featherlite-5-schlafsack-reg-links/">Montane Featherlite 5</a>, the <a href="http://bit.ly/1AInDmz">Rab Ascent 300</a> and the <a href="http://bit.ly/1cvmt1X">Western Mountaineering MegaLite</a> sleeping bags come to mind. The first is a synthetic sleeping bag while the other three are very good down sleeping bags, but none of these have two insulation materials in combination.</p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>If the idea of quilts is alien to you, then the Minix sleeping bag will be great for you. An ultralight sleeping bag that has a water-resistant shell you can use it without a bivy from spring to autumn as long as the thermometer stays above 0°C. The Primaloft bottom allows you to use a lighter, less insulated <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/sleeping-pads/">sleeping pad</a> as it is warm, even when compressed, and also is less sensitive to dew and moisture than down. The warm layer of 900 cuin down in box-wall construction on top keeps you toasty on fresh nights, and if it gets too warm you can even improvise the Minix into a narrow blanket. The water-resistant Ultrashell withstands dew and a light drizzle, protects the down and lets it loft nicely. If you want one sleeping bag for your 3-season trips that’s water-resistant, light, has a small pack size and is toasty warm, consider the Minix from PHD!</p>

<h2 id="where-to-buy-it">Where to buy it</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.phdesigns.co.uk/minix-down-primaloft-sleeping-bag">Minix</a> is part of the PHD <a href="http://stories.phdesigns.co.uk/summer-lightning-2015">Summer Lightning Collection</a> that is only available in May &amp; June from PHD directly - so hurry if you want this sleeping bag!</p>

    <updated>2015-05-22T22:48:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://hikinginfinland.com/2015/05/christopher-mcdougall-born-to-run</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s rare that I read a science/ novel/ diet/ adventure book which with each turn of the page has me think just one thing: I wanna go out for a run. Barefoot. <em><a href="http://amzn.to/1EnnrUf">Born to Run</a></em> is that book, and it is fortunate that the sun doesn’t set until 23 o’clock, leaving plenty of time for a quick run after reading in the evening.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17966167111" title="Born To Run by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7728/17966167111_9cc4bcb40f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Born To Run" /></a></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Born to Run sat for a while on my book shelf, and finally a couple of weeks ago I started reading it. Like many <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/books/">books</a> it was difficult to put down and but as the clock was going towards midnight I resistantly put the book down and went to sleep, just to read a couple more pages in the morning. As an ultralight backpacker and <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/luna-sandals-oso.html">Luna Sandals</a> enthusiast I have been since a long time an advocate of minimalist footwear, this book serves you with a great story why modern running (and hiking) shoes are bad for you &amp; great reasons why you should go for a run if you feel stressed. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Suffering is humbling. It pays to know how to get your butt kicked.</em> -Caballo Blanco</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But from the start. Christopher McDougall, the author, is a running enthusiast - but after plenty of problems with achilles tendons, knees and back pain he’s about to put his running shoes on the hook. After seeing a photo of a Tarahumara runner in a magazine while being on assignment in Mexico McDougall starts the search for these runners, which takes him deep down into the Copper Canyons in search of them and the mystical Caballo Blanco. What evolves is part adventure novel, part science &amp; nutrition journal and part sports history, in which you find out how McDougall went from almost stopping to run to running an Ultra in the Copper Canyon, meeting Scott Jurek and running with the elusive Tarahumara indians. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17777626938" title="Born To Run by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5321/17777626938_555fa11535_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Born To Run" /></a></p>

<p>Born to Run is mandatory reading for runners, and also backpackers - because the latter are just endurance runners that go a tad slower. It’s a gripping read that will have you forget the time while you turn each page in anticipation, ditch your running shoes, <a href="http://amzn.to/1Aju8Ms">try new foods</a>, ponder your first Ultra and having the itch to go out for a run. Pick Born To Run up at your local bookshop or order it from <a href="http://amzn.to/1EnnrUf">Amazon.com</a>, <a href="http://amzn.to/1FHztyZ">Amazon.co.uk</a> or <a href="http://amzn.to/1K8Ebns">Amazon.de</a> - and be prepared to wanna go running after reading a couple of pages!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I returned last Friday from a beautiful backpacking trip on the Via Dinarica in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It’s wild, gorgeous and has lots to offer to backpackers, packrafters, mountaineers and bikepackers alike. <em>A teaser of things to come.</em></p>

<p>I’m a tad busy so a detailed write-up has to wait, but enjoy one photo of each day (and then book your flights to Sarajevo to experience your own Balkan adventure)!</p>

Day 1 gave a taste of the snowy things to come. </p>

Day 2 brought rain, mist and climbing 60° snow slopes without mountaineering gear.</p>

Nestled in the lush, green valley was the Dubocani village we passed on Day four.</p>

<p>The new issue has a very lengthy special on Via Ferratas by me, as well as hiking in dangerous terrain. The latter gives tips on what to do when there’s no blue bird weather but you’re confronted by hail, snow and strong winds, how to cross rivers and what to consoder when you’re in the mountains and on glaciers.

    <link href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2015/05/arcteryx-acrux2-fl-gtx.html"/>
    <updated>2015-05-07T20:20:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://hikinginfinland.com/2015/05/arcteryx-acrux2-fl-gtx</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Acrux² FL GTX from <a href="http://arcteryx.com/">Arc’teryx</a> is the Canadian brand’s entry into the approach footwear business. Made of an hydrophobic outside and a Gore-Tex slipper with a Vibram MegaGrip sole, it is a unique shoe. How it performed in the outdoors, you can read here.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17203304149" title="Arc’teryx Acrux² FL GTX - Side and Sole by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7794/17203304149_daccb18e5a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Arc’teryx Acrux² FL GTX - Side and Sole" /></a></p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>The Acrux² FL GTX arrived in late March and has been along on the International Appalachian Trail in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/ireland/">Ireland</a>, where I wore it for seven days straight in rain and sunshine. I usually review gear only after a long period of time - often a year or longer - but as there’s a lot of interest in this shoe I wrote this initial review. I will update it after more use in the future. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16767071834" title="Arc’teryx Acrux² FL GTX at the coast by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8700/16767071834_2caf372641_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Arc’teryx Acrux² FL GTX at the coast" /></a></p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>The Arc’teryx Acrux² FL GTX is two shoes in one: A Gore-Tex liner (blue) and a Hydrophobic shell shoe (black). For simplicity’s sake I will refer to them as the liner and shell. As an approach shoe it’s function is to allow you to get easily to the crag and back and for that it has a grippy sole with a climbing zone in the toe area which allows you to do easy scrambles in them. The shell does not absorb water and the liner has a Gore-Tex lining, which makes it highly water-resistant.</p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>Arc’teryx separated the shell and lining of a traditional shoe and made two separate ones out of it, while re-designing both. So the upper is made from a single-piece of fabric, with a TPU-coating on the non-perforated parts which make them abrasion-resistant and let them shed water easily. The shell is also not sewn, but all parts are laminated together for a seam-free feel, which minimizes the risk of blisters and chaffing.</p>

<p>While there might have been shoes like these before, Arc’teryx is the first brand in recent time that brings a shoe with a removable liner to market. What’s very special is that the liners of the Acrux² and the Bora² are interchangable - which means you can use the high, insulated liner of the Bora in your Acrux, or if you need more water-protection in the Acrux use the high Gore-Tex bootie liner - They all work together. The liner is also thought to increase the airflow inside the shoe, which should maximize ventilation. It’s made from stretchable materials which hug your feet for a comfortable feeling, all day long.</p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>The quality of these shoes - both liner and shell - is superb as you expect from Arc’teryx. The whole construction is very tidy and clean, with no little threads hanging around. The laminated upper is super smooth and stylish, while the liner bootie has minimal seams and is very comfortable.</p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>The Arc’teryx Acrux² FL GTX is a medium-weight shoe, in EU Size 42 they weigh:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Liner: 126 g</li>
  <li>Shoe: 371 g</li>
  <li>Total: 499 g</li>
  <li><strong>PAIR 998 g</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p>The Acrux² FL GTX is a stylish shoe. If you travel a lot to go climbing &amp; hiking and also will spend some time in civilization, airplanes, hotels and B&amp;Bs the Acrux FL² GTX are great beacause while they are functional approach shoes they also could pass as a stylish city sneaker. I used them as a scramble and approach shoe as I was <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/04/sea-stack-climbing-in-ireland.html">sea stack climbing</a> and there they worked fantastic. The Vibram MegaGrip sole had superb traction on the wet slabs at the coast, and the small climbing zones at the toes allowed for good foot placements on small ledges. </p>

<p>Also for hiking the shoes were very comfortable, even in hot weather (more on that underneath). I was a bit worried before flying to Ireland if the shoe would be too hot and might give me blisters, but the truth was that even on long, high kilometer days the shoes were comfortable and I finished the trip without blisters, even on those close to 20°C sunshine &amp; blue-bird days. The laces were very good and did not come undone, something which has been a problem with some other shoes. The shoe is comfortable all day long, the liner hugs my foot nicely and you can lace up the shell as loose or tight as you like. At 499 g per shoe they’re medium weight but I didn’t get tired feet in the shoes. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17203380689" title="Arc’teryx Acrux² FL GTX by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7681/17203380689_b77edb80bc_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Arc’teryx Acrux² FL GTX" /></a></p>

<p>Now one of the design ideas of this shoes was that you can take the Gore-Tex liner out if it gets wet and can dry it overnight in your sleeping bag or tent. In practice I am not sure if it works, to get the liners dry again I needed to place them close to a radiator so that they would be dry the next morning; if there was no heat source then they were still moist the next morning. It could be that if you take the moist liners into your sleeping bag at a bivy that they will dry out well, but in my limited tests I am not sure if it works. An alternative could be to carry a 2nd pair of liner booties - at 126 g they’re not too heavy - and so ensure always dry feet. What I missed in this respect was that the shell did not have some drainage/ ventilation holes at the sole-level, this would help to get water out faster when you wade through a stream (or bog!).</p>

<p>What the liners are really great for is being used as a camp shoe. I used them to stroll around and the grippy rubber sole and light weight made them excellent for that. I also can imagine them to work very well for <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/packrafting/">packrafting</a>, where you can use them as your bootie in the packraft and the complete shoe for hiking. I jumped from rock to rock over the Atlantic with them on my sea stack adventure and they gave good grip on the wet &amp; salty rocks at the Irish coast, which means for me that they should be good as a paddling booty. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17182072687" title="Arc’teryx Acrux² FL GTX - 1.0 by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7786/17182072687_852f3232fb_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Arc’teryx Acrux² FL GTX - 1.0" /></a></p>

<p>Fit-wise I found the liner and shell to be both spacious. The EU Size 42 shoe gave me plenty of space inside the liner bootie to move my toes around, and when laced tighly they gave me good control and feel on small ledges. The heel did feel a bit wider and could for me be more narrow, but with a sock that’s well-cushioned in the heel you will have a good feel and should be fine. Overall a good &amp; spacious fit for my normal feet with plenty of space for movement.</p>

<p>I have a couple of gripes thus far with the shoe: The black shell makes the shoe very hot. Even on the mild (+11°C) spring days we have currently here in Vaasa the shoe is getting very hot, very quickly. I wore <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/bridgedale-coolmax-liner-socke-doppelpack-black-black-36-39/?pid=81">Coolmax socks</a> which usually are good in warm weather, but in this shoe I got hot feet very quickly. I am not sure if another colour would mitigate this, or if the shell would just need more &amp; larger ventilation openings in the shell shoe so the ventilation is improved. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17203302519" title="Arc’teryx Acrux² FL GTX - 2.0 by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8702/17203302519_31521ebe12_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Arc’teryx Acrux² FL GTX - 2.0" /></a></p>

<p>The second thing I do not recommend: Walk through a bog with them. Along the IAT in Ireland I crossed several swamps, and the combination of bog flora &amp; fauna + my own sweat created an unbearable smell in the shoes. It was absolutely terrible and I felt slightly afraid to go sit with them in a plane for several hours. At home I first tried the <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/grangers-universal-spray-cleaner-275ml/">Granger’s Universal Spray Cleaner</a> but that showed no success in terms of getting rid of the smell (probably should have used the <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/grangers-odour-eliminator-60ml/?pid=81">Granger’s Odour Eliminator</a>), so they went into the washing machine with <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/nikwax-tech-wash-pflegemittel-002/?pid=81">Nikwax Tech Wash</a> which got rid of the smell for the most part. So I would not recommend them for walking in swamps right now, unless there’s a good way to get rid of the smell. If you’re in alpine environments where there’s no bogs this will not be of concern, but in Ireland, Scotland, Wales, England and Scandinavia you’re likely to encounter swamps in the hills, so keep this in mind (It might be of course that your sweat germs in combination with a bog’s flora &amp; fauna creates an irresistible odour and it’s just my sweat that’s wrong!).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17182071337" title="Arc’teryx Acrux² FL GTX by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7728/17182071337_162901961c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Arc’teryx Acrux² FL GTX" /></a></p>

<p>Finally, I hope Arc’teryx will release at the coming <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/outdoor-fair-2014/">OutDoor</a> an membrane-free bootie liner. It really is missing for me in their bootie line-up, and I think it would make the shoe even more attractive for those of us who don’t need a Gore-Tex or Insulated bootie. Make it highly breathable with good drainage, with a material that’s odour-neutral, and it could be a winner.</p>

<h2 id="competing-products">Competing Products</h2>

<p>I am not aware right now if there’s similar shoes that are made of a liner + shell, but I have no doubts that there could be. For ultralight backpackers and weight-conscious alpinists a combination of a unlined approach shoe + a <a href="http://bit.ly/1F5m1op">Gore-Tex sock</a> or <a href="http://bit.ly/1F5lXVO">Neoprene Sock</a> could also create this combination of a quick-drying shoe and a waterproof liner that you can dry easily over night. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17387540382" title="Arc’teryx Acrux² FL GTX - Made for approaches by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7786/17387540382_19e7fb9a24_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Arc’teryx Acrux² FL GTX - Made for approaches" /></a></p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>The Acrux² FL GTX is a shoe that brings fresh wind into the approach shoe market. A comfortable, removable liner paired with a hydrophobic, stylish shell and a grippy Vibram MegaGrip sole make this a great shoe for approaches, Via Ferratas and scrambles. The price of 250€ puts it at the high-end, but then you get essentially two shoes for the price of one. Add in the versatilty the Acrux² offers with the interchangable, removable liners and you have a great shoe for your mountain adventures, and you can get rid of a stinky liner bootie if you have hiked through a bog! Finally, as this is the first Generation of Arc’teryx footwear we can be curious to see what they will come up with the next Generations!</p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.jacksrbetter.com/shop/high-sierra-sniveller/">Jacks ‘R’ Better High Sierra Sniveller</a> arrived in December 2013 at HiF HQ and has seen several outings since, amongst others to the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/05/a-lake-district-traverse.html">Lake District</a> in England.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14376802441" title="Bed by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5515/14376802441_7b2115dea3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Bed" /></a></p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>The Jacks ‘R’ Better High Sierra Sniveller is not just a quilt. It is</p>

<ul>
  <li>A quilt</li>
  <li>A serape/ poncho</li>
  <li>A top quilt for your hammock</li>
  <li>Almost a sleeping bag</li>
</ul>

<p>Made for cold temperatures the High Sierra Sniveller is a winter quilt which should keep you toasty to around -5°C to -10°C, maybe even colder temperatures if you’re a warm sleeper.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17350199956" title="JRB High Sierra Sniveller - Inside open by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7785/17350199956_125178e9ca_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="JRB High Sierra Sniveller - Inside open" /></a></p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>The High Sierra Sniveller can be used as a flat blanket, a sleeping bag/ quilt and a serape. A serape is like a poncho, and for that it has a Velcro head hole in the middle which you can open and put your head through. You then can tie it closed around your waist to minimize drafts. </p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>The JRB Sierra Sniveller Quilt is very well constructed, with clean seams, durable and high-quality materials. It uses a 1.1 oz., 30 denier ripstop nylon and 800 cuin fill power goose down. The shell &amp; lining material is soft and comfortable on the skin and the high-quality down keeps you toasty warm.</p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>679 g High Sierra Sniveller Quilt, Regular length</p>

<p>38 g Compression stuff sack</p>

<p><strong>717 g Total</strong></p>

<p>That’s a very good weight for a winter quilt, especially when set in relation to the price. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17376164525" title="JRB High Sierra Sniveller - Down under by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5450/17376164525_c009b7de26_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="JRB High Sierra Sniveller - Down under" /></a></p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.jacksrbetter.com/quilt-comparison-chart/">Quilt Comparison Chart</a> is ideal in my opinion for anyone considering a JRB quilt. These kind of tables should be standard for any company offering many similar products within the same category, as it makes choosing the right product for a customer much easier. </p>

<p>The High Sierra Sniveller is unassuming. A green, stealthy shell blends in in forest environments, and the black inside helps with drying the quilt in the sun in the morning. The construction is clean and sturdy, and while being lightweight I didn’t have the feeling that I need to treat it with silk gloves. The cord locks and cords as well as the Velcro closures radiate sturdiness, too. </p>

<p>I have used the High Sierra Sniveller mostly as a quilt/ sleeping bag and a flat blanket, in both configurations I was very happy with it. The footbox is long enough for me and it is easy to take one leg out of it to <em>“cool down”</em>. The Regular length has a small taper, it’s 132 cm wide at the top and goes down to 96 cm at the foot end. It was a good size for my thin self and drafts where no problem, also when sleeping on my side. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17376164655" title="JRB High Sierra Sniveller - Chilling by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8715/17376164655_8c5f7da7c7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="JRB High Sierra Sniveller - Chilling" /></a></p>

<p>I have used the JRB High Sierra Sniveller on autumn and spring trips where temperatures went down to around -2°C and it was too warm for me in those conditions, so I think it’s easily good to -5°C to -10°C as claimed by JRB. If you like to strap the quilt to your mat then there’s three pairs of webbing loops to allow you to do that. </p>

<p>Using it as a serape is only something for morning and evening use in Camp, I wouldn’t want to wear it while moving throughout the day - it’s not very ergonomic. If you’re out on a winter trip and want to minimize the puffy, space-consuming down jacket for camp and breaks, the High Sierra Sniveller will be a good solution for you. The draw-back is that you need to be more careful around campfires when wearing your High Sierra Sniveller, as you don’t want any holes from sparks or such in it. If saving weight &amp; space is a high importance, then the multiple use aspect of this quilt will be high. If not needed the head hole closes tightly and almost can’t be seen, and also has not been a source of drafts or similar. This is a good feature for people who want it, and if you don’t need it it’s easy enough to ignore that it’s there.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17168694907" title="JRB High Sierra Sniveller - Head hole closed by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8782/17168694907_cb451e5ed1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="JRB High Sierra Sniveller - Head hole closed" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17188369558" title="JRB High Sierra Sniveller - Head hole open by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7774/17188369558_f630c2f75a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="JRB High Sierra Sniveller - Head hole open" /></a></p>

<p>I didn’t like the compression bag a lot - it does tend to get into a strange shape, and the biggest problem I have with that is that packing it in a backpack creates some unusable, empty space. Also the pull strap you can hold on to feels, while being sturdily sewn, that it could break. I much prefer super basic roll-top closure stuff sacks that are light. The storage <em>“sack”</em> is a plastic square bag with a zipper, which I also felt isn’t the best place to store a down bag. Here I prefer large (organic) cotton bags or at least a fabric that’s breathable. Organic cotton bags also would be more environmentally friendly, and look nicer if stored in plain sight. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17189931059" title="JRB High Sierra Sniveller - Size comparison by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8728/17189931059_3b7cb85afd_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="JRB High Sierra Sniveller - Size comparison" /></a></p>

<p>With the sleeping bag I have no serious complaints. I saw that the head end got a push button in 2014 which allows you to close the quilt around your neck so it stays in place, this is a nice feature especially on more breezy, cold nights as it keeps drafts out and the warm air in. JRB also is now using a hydrophobic down, which is good for a quilt which is likely used in wet &amp; cold environments. The cord locks and cords are very durable and big, I imagine JRB could easily use smaller &amp; lighter versions of these without making them more difficult to use but saving a bit of weight. I also would put the top loops for attaching the quilt to a mat further down, though in use the two pairs in the middle should be enough if you use that feature.</p>

<h2 id="competing-products">Competing Products</h2>

<p>The quilt maker market has seen some influx in the last years, and also some big brands have started to make quilts. Directly competing with the JRB High Sierra Sniveller are for me, given it’s unique feature set, only the <a href="http://astucas.com/en/products/sestrals-poncho">As Tucas Sestrals Poncho</a> and the <a href="http://www.mountainlaureldesigns.com/shop/product_info.php?cPath=42&amp;products_id=133">MLD Spirit Quilt</a>, though both are synthetic insulation quilts. These have the option to wear it as a poncho. A warm winter quilt is also the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2012/01/katabatic-gear-sawatch-quilt.html">Katabatic Gear Sawatch Quilt</a>, and then there’s several other quilts &amp; sleeping bags which are fit for winter use.</p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>I like the Jacks ‘R’ Better High Sierra Sniveller. The Multiple-use aspect of it is great: You can use it as an open blanket, a quilt, a poncho and also as a top quilt in your hammock, which is superb value for your money - if you need these options. If you don’t plan to use the High Sierra Sniveller as a serape you might be able to save some weight by getting a quilt without the head hole, though it probably is useful to have in an emergency - and does not add a substantial amount of weight. As a quilt it performs just as it should: Unpack, let it loft and then have a comfortable, un-restricted night’s sleep underneath it. It’s easy to vent when you run warm, and if you plan to use it as a serape it will save you money that you’d spent on a dedicated down jacket. If you’re looking for a multiple-use, lightweight, warm and affordable autumn to spring quilt, take a good look at the High Sierra Sniveller from Jacks ‘R’ Better - you won’t be disappointed.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dragons and <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.co.uk/dmm-demon-cam-cam/">Demons</a> are not just part of any good fantasy novel, but also hang on the harness of many Trad Climbers. And because for longer routes you need more than just a set of <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/dmm-dragon-cams.html">Dragon Cams</a>, a pair of Demon Cams has found their way into my climbing pack. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16743368694" title="DMM Demon Cams by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7688/16743368694_34f21b81ce_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="DMM Demon Cams" /></a></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>The <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.co.uk/dmm-demon-cam-cam/">DMM Demon Cams</a> arrived last spring and have been along to Olhava, the local crag close to Vaasa, <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/mountaineering-and-climbing-in-the-polish-tatras.html">rock climbing in Poland</a> and Alpine climbing in Chamonix. But why would I need a 2nd pair of cams besides the Dragons? Well, longer routes need more protection, the Demon Cams have different size ranges than the Dragon, are a single axle design and are lighter. That was enough reason for me to get a pair from <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.co.uk/">Bergfreunde.co.uk</a>, and since they have free shipping on orders over 50€ in Europe it has gotten pretty easy to order from them.</p>

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/49821137?color=cc0033&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>The Demon is a combination of two DMM Cams: It takes the single stem of the Dragon and the Cams of the 4CU. They are single axle, single stem, with the trademark extendable Dyneema sling. The cam lobes make use of the 13.75° camming angle, have an Active strength rating of 14 kN (and a Passive rating of 10 kN) and are Made in Wales.</p>

<p>As you might know, cams are active protection. While the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/02/dmm-wallnuts.html">nuts and hexes</a> have no moving parts, cams do have moving parts - this allows them to suit a wider range of cracks - where you might need to carry one or more different nuts to place them in a crack, a cam’s lobes can be moved by pulling on the trigger which makes them narrower &amp; thus you can enter it in a crack. Release the trigger and the lobes will wedge themselves into the rock, being, if placed correctly, a solid piece of protection. They are also versatile in the sense that you can use them passively - that is that you just place the cam as it is into a crack, much like a Nut, without pulling the trigger. Unlike the DMM Dragon Cams the Demon Cam has a lower passive strength rating than active rating. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16743368334" title="DMM Demon Cams by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8774/16743368334_eff30e3137_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="DMM Demon Cams" /></a></p>

<p>The Demons come without a carabiner, so I got the colour-coded <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.co.uk/dmm-alpha-trad-non-locking-carabiner/">DMM Alpha Trad ‘biners</a> and two <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.co.uk/dmm-phantom-non-locking-carabiner/">Phantom carabiners</a> with the cams. The Trad biners are very nice and easy to clip, quite large and at 34 g they’re still light. The Phantom is only 26 g but you can easily feel and note the difference in size, its gate is also a bit heavier to clip. If you get pumped or nervous and want to be sure you can easily and quickly clip the rope, take the Alpha trad carabiners, they have a far better handling. Cam Lobes, slings and Alpha Trad carabiners can (and should!) be colour-matched for easily finding the right cam when you’re on the wall.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17365876125" title="DMM Demon Cams by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8824/17365876125_aaf623fb92_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="DMM Demon Cams" /></a></p>

<p>Back to the Demon Cams, and lets look at their weights. Here’s the weight of the Demon Cam alone and with a Alpha Trad carabiner.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Size 4,0: 223 g (259 g)</li>
  <li>Size 3,5: 182 g (218 g)</li>
  <li>Size 2,5: 129 g (165 g)</li>
  <li>Size 1,5: 102 g (138 g)</li>
  <li>Size 1,0: 98 g (134 g)</li>
  <li>Size 0,5: 90 g (126 g)</li>
  <li>Size 0: 84 g (120 g)</li>
</ul>

<p>The whole rack of seven Demon cams with Alpha Trad biners is 1.160 g. That is a tad heavier than the Dragons (the six of them including carabiners is 819 g) but the size range of the Demons here speaks for them. For comparison:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Size 4 Demon Cam (223 g) has a lobe size range of 64 to 100 mm</li>
  <li>Size 4 Dragon Cam (149 g) has a lobe size range of 38 to 64 mm</li>
</ul>

<p>This difference can be seen throughout the two Cam lines. If you want to have a <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.co.uk/camming-devices/">Cam</a> with a large operating range, then the Demon is the way to go my opinion.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17365533331" title="DMM Demon Cams by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8899/17365533331_95f25e7afa_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="DMM Demon Cams" /></a></p>

<p>The 8 mm Dyneema sling is extendable to 23 cm which allows you to carry less slings and quick-draws to the hills. I love this feature of the DMM Cams and wouldn’t want to miss it. DMM also thinks along and offers a service to re-sling the cams when the Dyneema slings become worn out, which is a sustainable and environmentally friendly service and makes the cams long-lasting.</p>

<p>Which brings me to Quality. Which is fantastic. I guess you have expected this already, but I really value these cams - as all my other gear from DMM - very highly. The flexible stem, durable materials that are anodized makes them long-lasting, also at <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/04/sea-stack-climbing-in-ireland.html">sea stacks</a>. They have seen quite a bit of use but still look pretty good, and I expect them to last many more years.</p>

<p>If there’s something which I don’t like about them, well they are expensive - but then so are most cams. I also am wondering why DMM does repeat colours on the cams and ‘biners - Gold, Blue and Silver are used twice in the same series, and with there being hundreds of colours this is a bit odd. I would wish DMM would add more colours in the future, this makes it easier to choose the right cam and eliminates mix-ups. Imagine you want to grab the large blue 3.5 cam but grab the tiny blue 0 cam? Also the stem could be a tiny bit longer, which would make it easier to place them in deep cracks. I also think they could be offered as a complete set with a carabiner (preferably for a better price than buying them separately). And finally, if they’d be a <em>tiny</em> bit lighter, well, I wouldn’t mind that either!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17158410927" title="DMM Demon Cams by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8854/17158410927_28d89d8448_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="DMM Demon Cams" /></a></p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>I really like <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.co.uk/brands/dmm/">DMM</a> gear. It’s well-designed and Made in Europe, which I value a lot. With the climbing trips this year I reckon the Dragons and Demons will both see plenty of use, especially in the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/03/the-dolomites-rock-climbs-and-via-ferrata.html">Dolomites</a> and here in Finland. If you’re new to Trad climbing and in the market for some active protection then you might want to have a chat with your climbing partners and see what they recommend for your home crag, but eventually, and especially when you will travel to go climbing, you will likely end up with a complete rack or more. With the Demons you get a superb single stem, single axle cam. You’ll value the extendable sling pretty quickly as it allows you to leave some Quick-draws at the bottom of the crag. They are easy to place and equally easy to remove if you second. These durable cams will not make you a better climber, but they are so long-lasting that they will see you become better over time. </p>

<p>You can get the complete DMM Demon Cam package at <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.co.uk/dmm-demon-cam-cam/">Bergfreunde.co.uk</a> in Europe and <a href="http://bit.ly/1JLrstV">Backcountry.com</a> in North America.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ireland has more to offer than <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2015/04/sea-stack-climbing-in-ireland.html">Sea Stacks</a> - there’s superb crags across the country. David Flanagan’s “<a href="http://threerockbooks.com/index.php/rock-climbing-in-ireland/">Rock Climbing in Ireland</a>” helps you plan your trip to the Emerald Isle - which has climbing on half a dozen types of rock to offer, at sea cliffs, in the mountains and beautiful crags!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17307673186" title="Rock Climbing in Ireland by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7759/17307673186_e118d35b78_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Rock Climbing in Ireland" /></a></p>

<p>Fellow climbers will easily be able to relate - get a new guide book into your hands and immediately you start thinking about a trip to the area the book presents. While I just returned from Ireland a couple of weeks ago browsing <a href="http://threerockbooks.com/index.php/rock-climbing-in-ireland/">Rock Climbing in Ireland</a> has me thinking about when I could again visit the island for some climbing - and plenty of awesome climbing there is in Ireland.</p>

<p>The book starts of with the basics you need to know about climbing in Ireland - Access and Conservation, Equipment, When to Visit, Accommodation and how to get around the island. A Crag Table lists all 22 crags and what sorts of routes you will find there, and then right away dives in with describing the different crags. These include a introduction, tips on accommodation in the area, what you could do on rainy or rest days, conditions and directions to the crag. A large overview photo often shows the crag and the different sectors, and a small, basic overview map helps with navigating. The Topos and Route descriptions are coming with good details and some great photos of the climbs will get you in the mood for a route. And finally, a Route Index at the end of the book lets you find a route quickly.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17331763072" title="Rock Climbing in Ireland by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8735/17331763072_7285ee4f9a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Rock Climbing in Ireland" /></a></p>

<p>I loved the clean, minimalistic and well-structured layout of the Guidebook. It was aesthetically very pleasing to read, with a nice &amp; clear typography and great topo photos - these are something that make a climbing guide book not merely good, but great. What I missed was that some crags didn’t have information on accommodation and rainy &amp; rest days tips, I think for many people visiting from abroad it would help to have a recommendation for where to stay and what to do when the weather is shite. This is my only complaint (<em>and something you can find out yourself with the help of an online search</em>), and overall I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is planning to go rock climbing in Ireland. The beautiful guide book will make you look forward to visiting this beautiful island with the fair weather and gives you with over 400 routes in it more than enough inspiration of where to go &amp; what to climb!</p>

<p>Buy Rock Climbing in Ireland at your local book store or climbing gym, order it directly from the author at <a href="http://threerockbooks.com/index.php/rock-climbing-in-ireland/">Three Rock Books</a>, or your local taste of <a href="http://amzn.to/1GCHy2y">Amazon.com</a>, <a href="http://amzn.to/1zkr3e1">Amazon.co.uk</a> or <a href="http://amzn.to/1bKkvdP">Amazon.de</a>.</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>Five years ago, on the 25th of April 2010, <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2010/04/the-week-in-review.html">the first The Week in Review</a> saw the light. I had been blogging for a bit over a year by then, was following a growing number of outdoor blogs and felt it was difficult to <strong>separate the weekend hill walk from the epic adventures</strong> (there’s nothing wrong with weekend hill walks, btw - I love these myself!) - and so the first weekly outdoor-related curated post was born. The idea was pretty straight forward: Share with my readers the other great &amp; useful, fun and inspiring outdoor content on other blogs I read (and they maybe not (yet)). Hiking in Finland was back then already quite popular and as <strong>sharing is caring</strong> I thought it’s useful to give some other blogs some love, too. </p>

<p>It always has been pretty roughly 50% subjective and 50% objective content that found its way into TWIR, content that I liked a lot and content that I knew you, the readers will find useful. This often included skills, Tips &amp; Tricks and gear reviews - finding believable and high-quality reviews on ultralight gear has not been easy and still can be difficult. The same goes for inspiring trip reports - it can be hard to find some real pearls.</p>

<p>There have been a handful of <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2015/03/the-week-in-review-clxxxxvii.html">Mystery Editions</a>, one <a href="https://flipboard.com/@hendrikmorkel/the-week-in-review-xxxvi-pfh7659jy">TWIR on Flipboard</a> and 199 other awesome TWIRs. You can <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/the-week-in-review/">browse them all here</a> (<em>There’s some problems with the earliest TWIRs because of the URLs - happened when moving from Blogspot to Octopress - which I am working on a fix</em>).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17022136640" title="Swell by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7688/17022136640_d5349517b6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Swell" /></a></p>

<h2 id="blogs-blogs-blogs">Blogs Blogs Blogs</h2>

<p>From the beginning TWIR was <strong>highlighting content on outdoor blogs</strong>. The first blogs in my RSS Reader were probably from my fellow Nordic Lightpacking friends: <a href="http://nielsenbrown.com/">Roger</a>, <a href="https://thunderinthenight.exposure.co/">Joe</a>, <a href="http://www.fjaderlatt.se/">Martin &amp; Jörgen</a>, <a href="http://thebearablelightness.blogspot.fi/">Gustav</a>, <a href="http://www.backpackingnorth.com/">Mark</a> and <a href="http://goinglighter.blogspot.fi/">Thomas</a> followed by blogs from the UK, Germany, Europe, Australia, Asia and of course the USA. The number of blogs in my RSS reader started to grow quickly, though, and nowadays there’s close to 800 blogs in my subscription list. The last one I added is <a href="https://limitcamper.wordpress.com/">Limitcamper</a>, and each week a couple more are subscribed to.</p>

<p>While in the beginning it was a manageable task - blogging was just going down in popularity again in 2010/ 2011 - it quickly started to be a full-day task to keep track of all the superb content. Nowadays, if I don’t already browse during the week a bit in the RSS Reader, I easily can have 500 or more unread items on a Sunday waiting for me. I also try to vary the blogs I feature - even if some people create outstanding content each week (you should subscribe to their blogs to not miss a thing!) it is more interesting so find something fresh from someone new each week.</p>

<p>What RSS Reader I use has changed also, from the now-death Google Reader over Reeder I now am using the fantastic <a href="https://feedbin.com/">Feedbin</a>, which I highly recommend if you read blogs via RSS.</p>

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/125476007?color=ffffff&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/">Photos</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Habichtshorst">Videos</a> have always been a part of The Week In Review. <strong>The internet is a visual medium</strong> and sharing great photos and videos not just loosens up the structure but also makes it more attractive. But more structure was needed and became gradually part of TWIR. It was <a href="https://twitter.com/rollofunk">Mikael</a> who suggested I number the issues for easier reference, and that’s the reason we can have a cake with two hundred candles on it today =)</p>

<p>While the superb content on other blogs is still the core of each TWIR, nowadays also news, gear deals and interesting announcements are part of it. This meant I needed to find a better way to separate News from Trip Reports and Gear Reviews - which gave rise to the sub-headers. This makes it also easier for the readers to go directly to the section they are interested in, or when looking something up to find it more easily. So besides great content from Outdoor blogs you now also can find interesting posts from major newspapers and other outdoor media.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>When you talk, you are only repeating what you already know. But if you listen, you may learn something new.</em> - Dalai Lama</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And because I follow blogs from across the globe and often include blogs in another language in the TWIR, it was <a href="https://twitter.com/korpijaakko">Jaakko</a> who suggested I add also a short [Language] tag behind those posts that are in another language than English. The final additions have been the last <em>“Share it with your friends”</em> sentence, encouraging you to let your friends know about the TWIR, and an inspiring, thoughtful quote as the intro. There have been suggestions to sort articles by activity - packrafting, hiking, climbing and cycling - though I feel that’s not needed right now. And clicking on an inspiring bike-touring article as a hiker certainly can’t harm, but only open the mind!</p>

<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>

<p>Back in 2009 a bunch of mates set out on a <a href="http://www.tetongravity.com/forums/showthread.php?t=169211">33 days in Wrangell St. Elias National Park adventure</a> which still today is an EPIC in the truest sense of the word.</p>

<p>Joery’s adventures also are good in my memory, like his <a href="http://dzjow.com/2012/10/08/protect-the-peel-first-pics/">Peel Watershed Hiking &amp; Packrafting Trip</a>.</p>

<p>Also Willem’s <a href="https://willemvandoorne.wordpress.com/2014/01/25/greenland-part-iv-a-loop-into-cape-farewell-country/">Greenland adventure</a> ranks high in my memory.</p>

<p>And if I already mention Joery and Willem obviously Steve &amp; Katrijn can’t miss because they make the Belgian trio complete. Their world trip, especially their <a href="http://patagoniandreams.com/2013/05/06/patagonia-un-paseo-otonal-entre-la-roca-el-hielo-y-la-lenga/">trips in Patagonia</a>, have me looking up flights and thinking schedules for a trip there.</p>

<p>And finally, the <a href="http://distantranges.com/in-the-golden-mountains-of-altai-part-1/">In the Golden Mountains of Altai</a> trip report has me certain that I need to go to Russia for some hiking and packrafting.</p>

<p>But there have been many, many more memorable posts, so you really should <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/the-week-in-review/">browse the past TWIRs</a>. Comment underneath and let me know which was your favourite story that you found via The Week In Review!</p>

<h2 id="the-future">The Future</h2>

<p>The Week In Review, 200 issues, five years old. As a friend asked this morning: Did I think this would happen? Nope. I’m also still surprised by the mass of people who read it and love it, for whom TWIR is their daily stop on a Sunday or Monday, where they <strong>find inspiring and beautiful outdoor stories</strong> and stay informed on what’s happening in the outdoor blog-o-sphere.</p>

<p>While there have been moments where I have felt like <em>Today’s not a TWIR day</em> these have been fewer and fewer thanks to effective management of how I write and organize them. Which means The Week In Review is here to stay, and I am looking forward to bringing you more inspiring outdoor stories in the years to come. And if I miss a Sunday - it’s usually because I’m out backpacking, packrafting, climbing or bikepacking myself =) </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s weekend so its time to head outdoors, to the cabin. Got none? <a href="http://shop.gestalten.com/books/hide-seek.html">Hide and Seek - The Architecture of Cabins and Hide-Outs</a> will give you plenty of cabins to dream of over the weekend and inspire you to dream up your own.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17066651669" title="Hide and Seek - The Architecture of Cabins and Hide-Outs by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7606/17066651669_6213274751_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Hide and Seek - The Architecture of Cabins and Hide-Outs" /></a></p>

<p>Friday is the day where the mind starts to wander to a lonely log cabin in the woods, by the lake, heated by a wood stove, no electricity. Or is it more a luxurious cabin by the sea? Maybe a sleek mountain hut that looks old and ramshackle from the outside but that’s modern and cool inside? <a href="http://shop.gestalten.com/books/hide-seek.html">Hide and Seek - The Architecture of Cabins and Hide-Outs</a> has them all: Coastal cabins, mountain cabins, open range cabins and the wood cabin, nicely sorted into four chapters of the finest cabins the authors could find. And they have searched far and wide, from the Isle of Skye to New Zealand and Finland to Chile, there’s bound to be a cabin for everyone in this book, Gestalten’s 2nd Cabin book after <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/rock-the-shack.html">Rock the Shack</a>.</p>

<p>The book presents the cabins &amp; their interiors of people who don’t want to give up life in the city but want to be able to escape to nature. And as unique as we are as humans, so unique are the cabins, their surroundings and interiors in this book. The focus clearly is on small living spaces in nature, because the outside in front of the window is your living room in many cases, your entertainment, TV and internet. The book aims to inspire you to dream up your own cabin, but you’ll not find plans or construction tips in this coffee table book. However, in the index at the end of the book you can find out more about the architects of the cabins, so that gives you a good starting point.</p>

<p>Sadly we don’t have a own cabin by the sea or lake, so a book which inspires the mind for a more simple life away from home certainly is a good way to relax. I found the book interesting, though I saw a trend to very minimalistic, modern, almost similar looking cabins - with just the scenery changing from the coast to the mountains to the forests. There was a lot of wood, concrete, steel and stones used, all in similar shapes &amp; designs, often with straight lines. Standing out were really only Steve’s Thailand Dome House, the Tree Tent, the Cocoon and the Tree Snake Houses in terms of its design - that was fresh &amp; organic architecture. While I liked most cabins in the book, I missed more organic, natural and rustic cabins and interiors - which there shouldn’t be a shortage of. Personally I also would have liked a more inhabited look in the interior photos, many had the sterile-looking feel of a Modern Art Museum.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17065096818" title="Hide and Seek - The Architecture of Cabins and Hide-Outs by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7601/17065096818_c322948cab_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Hide and Seek - The Architecture of Cabins and Hide-Outs" /></a></p>

<p>Despite this I would recommend this coffee table book to anyone who likes huts &amp; cabins and can’t get enough of them. You’re bound to have seen some of the featured hide-outs in the book if you follow <a href="http://cabinporn.com/">Cabinporn</a> but there’s a host of new &amp; fresh cabins featured which will get you dreaming about a weekend (or life!) away in them. It’s a beautiful book with high-quality paper and photographs, very legible typography and a clear layout which makes for a satisfying experience when reading &amp; browsing. There’s all in all 80 cabins and hide-outs in the book on 250 pages, and the nature &amp; scenery around the hide-outs and cabins is just as gorgeous as the huts themselves. I’m now off to dream up my own hut, if you need some weekend inspiration grab the book at your local book store or order it online from <a href="http://shop.gestalten.com/books/hide-seek.html">Gestalten</a>, <a href="http://amzn.to/1KbYSiH">Amazon.com</a>, <a href="http://amzn.to/1duc68Y">Amazon.co.uk</a> or <a href="http://amzn.to/1ElTl8s">Amazon.de</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16603773563" title="Bike &amp; Travel Magazine 01/2015 by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7611/16603773563_614d0ea74e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Bike &amp; Travel Magazine 01/2015" /></a></p>

<p>The <a href="http://biketravel-magazin.com/">Bike &amp; Travel Magazine</a> hit the shelves last week, but together with the publisher I have been working since spring 2014 on this new magazine. It was one of the reasons for me to get a couple of new <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/11/pelago-bicycles-stavanger.html">bikes</a> and it has been an interesting ride to see a new magazine being born. I will contribute to the magazine for at least the next two years, so if you like my writing you might want to <a href="https://ssl.topackt.com/trekkingmagazin.com/bikeabo/abo_eingabe.php?AboArt=ZweiJahresabo">take out a subscription</a> and don’t miss any issue. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17036201878" title="Bike &amp; Travel Magazine 01/2015 by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7705/17036201878_11a7108d95_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Bike &amp; Travel Magazine 01/2015" /></a></p>

<p>For this issue I contributed an article on comfortable sleeping along the trail/ road and lament that many people seem to be using massive tents and camping gear - the reasoning seems to be that many traditional bike-tourers think along the lines of <em>“I don’t need to carry it and have plenty of space”</em> - I showcase gear from the opposite side of the spectrum (so it’s light, compact and just as comfortable). Future articles will continue along these lines and also include a few nice bike tours in Europe. </p>

<p>The main focus of the magazine is on the adventures and tours you can do with your bike. The magazine has eight trip reports in the inaugural issue and is set to continue along these lines - there’s enough cycling gear magazines on the market already, and as <a href="http://www.fastcoexist.com/3043858/world-changing-ideas/the-science-of-why-you-should-spend-your-money-on-experiences-not-thing">research shows</a> - experiences are more valuable than the stuff you own. In that sense, grab the first issue of <a href="http://biketravel-magazin.com/">Bike &amp; Travel</a>, swing a leg over your bike and go for a ride!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ashfall Quartz. Ebb. Tide. Swell. Mix it together, throw in a rubber dinghy and you have the stuff for a Sea Stack climbing adventure.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17002240157" title="The sea worthy vessel to cross over to the sea stack by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7626/17002240157_6342150a0a_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="The sea worthy vessel to cross over to the sea stack" /></a></p>

<p>From the distance Berg Stack looks like a wee little rock in the North Atlantic Ocean, just off the cost of An Port in County Donegal, Ireland. We - Iain, our guide, a photographer and an US American journalist - slept the last night in the Port Cottage and now a blue sky &amp; sunshine have us frolicking in the superb weather. <em>“Lets go and check out the swell and tide”</em> Iain announces. We pack up our climbing gear and the 40€ rubber dinghy, bought at a Toy Shop - three at a time, they’re not that durable and walk the <a href="http://www.walkni.com/iat/">IAT</a> path up to the sea stack.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16589476163" title="Berg Stack on the right, Vertical Picnic stack on the left by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8697/16589476163_e1526639df_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Berg Stack on the right, Vertical Picnic stack on the left" /></a></p>

<p>What looked like a wee sea stack from the lawn of the cottage turns out to be a 25 m high sea stack with a large ledge at the bottom, beautiful cracks and pin scars lining it from bottom to top and a Great black-backed gull with its nest on top. Oh, and an angry Atlantic Ocean with a two to four metre swell, making for not a good time to cross. We still inflate the unnamed dinghy, Iain gives me the instructions of how to assist him when he will board the sea worthy vessel to establish a tyrollean traverse on Berg Stack so I can get over, too.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17023512169" title="Iain from Unique Ascents having a look at the sea, Berg Stack in the background by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8693/17023512169_4922bee743_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Iain from Unique Ascents having a look at the sea, Berg Stack in the background" /></a></p>

<p>The we sit &amp; wait. Observe the swell. Finally Iain decides we’ll come back at high tide later in the afternoon, when the sea should be calmer. Adrenaline that was build up in anticipation disappears, shoes go back on and we go for a nice hill walk, checking out Cnoc na Mara - the Sea Stack we had originally planned to go up, but with this sea that would have been too much risk. The views are spectacular, the valley deserted and I can make out a dozen of superb spots for a wild camp.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17021928808" title="A look up Berg Stack by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5322/17021928808_206ed924b5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="A look up Berg Stack" /></a></p>

<p>Sea stack climbing is less about climbing, really. Sure, it helps if you can climb well and know how to place gear - it’s all trad - but it is just as much about the skill set an Alpinist has: Patience, Risk Assessment, Speed &amp; Efficiency. Maritime skills &amp; knowledge are also essential, knowing when the tide is coming in, how high the swell is, if it is safe, being patient. Finally, a bit of daring for an adventure is also needed. After all, if you think paddling in a toyshop rubber dinghy on the Atlantic is insane, then sea stack climbing is nothing for you.</p>

<p>We’re back on the main land and observe the sea. It is high tide, the swell is still high but every now &amp; then there’s a calm moment - and one of these Iain uses to paddle over to Berg Stack. An euphoric cry echoes over the sea and you can see how a load is off his shoulders. He sets up an anchor for the tyrollean traverse, and during the next calm moment he’s back on the main land. We discuss the strategy and then it all goes quick: the dinghy is back in the water and Iain is in it, surfing the swell, a 240 cm sling connecting him to the tyrollean. A calm moment comes, he paddles in and I jump in - and just as quick out again off on Berg Stack. We both howl a cry of victory, a victory over the tide and swell.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17021935758" title="Berg Stack by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5343/17021935758_1ab7fb492e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Berg Stack" /></a></p>

<p>From here on it’s all basic rock climbing: Harness and rock shoes come on, Iain racks up and we tie into the rope. I stand barefoot on the ledge, the swell crashing on the rocks around. Iain leads up a variation the <em>Cormorant</em> which he probably has climbed a dozen times and before long an “Off belay” call echoes down to me. It is a nice route with great hand and foot holds up till the middle to the arête, then it goes around the arête and up a wet corner, which is also the toilet of the Great black-backed gull and its offspring which were kind enough to let us top out there. A moment later I stand on the top of Berg Stack next to Iain, high-fiving him, and again we both let out a howl of victory. But this is not a sports climb where you just clip into the chain and then rappel off. No, this is a sea stack. And the sea is angry.</p>

<p>The easiest way off the top back to the ledge is to down-climb a corner to about two meters above the rushing sea, and then traverse the sea stack on superb ledges &amp; holds back to where we started. We short-rope and five minutes later stand next to our dinghy. The sea is lower, more rocks can be seen as the ebb comes in, but the swell is still high. <em>“Lets wait till the tide is out and then walk off”</em> Iain says, and so we deflate the dinghy which has served us so well on the way here, pack up and wait. Wait for the water to retreat, for the swell to let us escape from this rock.</p>

<p>The sea does not see a reason for letting us off, it wants to keep us. The swell is high and white foam rushes over the barnacle-covered rocks, which would otherwise allow us to easily walk off. The sun throws its last rays on the main land, we can see the hut from our ledge and the comfort of the warm fire in the cozy cottage and slowly we’re getting cold &amp; hungry. Low tide arrives, but the swell still throws up large, foamy waves over the rocks we should have just walked off.</p>

<p>Iain goes first, jumps the large gap and makes it just to the top of a big rock when a wave comes in. He brings me my approach shoes and throws them over, as I do not fancy jumping barefoot on wet, slimy rocks and risking a broken ankle. Waiting for the right moment I too make the jump, and a final victory cry echoes from the rocks - the land has me again. We pack up and in the falling dusk walk to the cottage, where a warm fire and cool beer are waiting for us. My appetite for sea stack climbing is awakened, but first I’ll need to hike further on the International Appalachian Trail to Northern Ireland, to return another day for more sea stack climbing adventures.</p>

<h2 id="practicalities">Practicalities</h2>
<p>There’s a <a href="http://www.uniqueascent.ie/sea_stack_guide">free Sea Stack Guide book</a> if you want to go sea stack climbing - it has almost all sea stacks in it. A selection of sea stacks you also find in the <a href="http://threerockbooks.com/index.php/rock-climbing-in-ireland/">Rock Climbing in Ireland</a> book. I would suggest you do your first sea stack with Iain from <a href="http://www.uniqueascent.ie/">Unique Ascents</a> and learn the ins &amp; outs from him about the sea and getting safely on and off the sea stack. He’s also a great guy and you’ll have a lot of fun on a day out with him. You’ll need a sea-worthy vessel - maybe <a href="http://www.packrafting-store.de/Rentals:::34.html">loan a packraft</a>, but be sure you also know how to use it and have an idea about the tide, swell and weather forecast. If a sea stack is too much adventure, check out the <a href="http://www.uniqueascent.ie/undiscovered_donegal">Donegal rock climbers guide</a> and visit one of the local crags, though there are also <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CfM3DTcHcS8">calm days on Berg Stack</a>.</p>

<p>If you plan to climb in the area around An Port stay in the <a href="http://port-donegal.com/">Port Donegal Cottage</a> - either book via their website or on <a href="http://www.ownersdirect.co.uk/accommodation/p8069109">Owners Direct</a>. It has a wonderful cozy feel and relaxing in the bathtub after a day out on the sea will be so good that you don’t wanna go out. It sleeps eight and with some luck Roland, the owner, will be around and delight you with his stories from far away places.</p>

<p>The nearest village via a road is Ardara where you find several accommodation options like the <a href="http://www.bayviewcountryhouse.com/">Bayview Country House</a> and also shops and the <a href="http://www.nancysardara.com/">Nancy’s of Ardara Pub</a> for a after-climb pint, though it adds at least 45 minutes driving to your approach. For rest days go to Glencolmcille in the neighbouring valley and visit the <a href="http://glenfolkvillage.com/">Folk Museum</a> where you can see how people lived in the last centuries in the area, grab a good cup of coffee and a bite.</p>

<p>Gear wise you will need Trad gear as there are no bolts. Bring cord and slings if you want to abseil and need to build an anchor. Most of all, be patient with the sea and be open for the adventure!</p>

<p>I love climbing, and the <a href="http://www.camp.it/EN/template01.aspx?codicemenu=1475">CAMP Supernova</a> was my try to get my wife fall in love with it too. With the Supernova Harness being a harness conceived by women, designed by women, and built for women I thought this will be the harness for her, and while she did like the lightweight and comfortable harness she isn’t as obsessed about climbing as me. M liked the padding and ease of adjustment of the harness, with a fully adjustable waist and leg loops, and the No-Twist belay loop came in handy when she was belaying me. / 360 g in Size M</p>

<p>Gloves, the eternal struggle. If all you need gloves for is that they keep your fingers warm and look good you’re a lucky person and won’t understand the “Search for the perfect glove” that outdoor enthusiasts, and especially ice climbers, conduct. The <a href="https://hestragloves.com/sport/intl/gloves/mountaineering/ergo-grip-outdry-dexterity-long-five-finger/100100/">Hestra Ergo Grip OutDry Dexterity Long</a> is as close to the perfect ice climbing and mountaineering glove I have come, me thinks. It is warm, waterproof with an OutDry membrane, offers superb dexterity and is very, very durable. I have used this fine glove for two winters now and some mountaineering and love it. It’s easy to clip ropes, open ‘biners, conduct fiddly work and keep warm fingers, even when water is running down the shaft of your ice tools. / 186 g for the Pair in Size 9</p>

<p>294 in that name stands for the 294 steel studs with carbide pins on these tires, which makes these <em>the</em> cycling tires for icy conditions - and thanks to the triple thaw + freeze cycles we had this “<em>winter</em>” (and the last one, too) the <a href="http://www.suomityres.com/eng/tyres/">Gazza Extreme</a> have been very, very useful. Suomi Tyres is a small company from Eastern Finland and they know how to make some of the best bicycle tires on the planet - they are since 90 years in this business. They’re the only bicycle tyre manufacturer in Northern Europe (check this <a href="https://youtu.be/lxYa4Lb3VRI?list=UUl1rmXRFLvoJlm4E8UirZVw">video of how the tires are made</a>) and produce since ten years already environmentally sound tires from pure rubber compounds. I have ridden the Gazza Extreme on my 29er in the last two winters and didn’t slip once with them on icy roads and frozen lakes. These tires are on the bike a good five to six months a year and so far have yet to lose one stud! / 1090 g per tyre</p>

<p>Back to boots! Well, not really, but for Nordic Skating and Backcountry XC Skiing the <a href="http://lundhags.se/">Lundhags</a> BC Guide Boots have been fantastic. The shoe was out of the box comfortable, in part probably thanks to the 3 mm wool felt liner boot which can be removed. The boot itself is made from a Perwanger split leather on top which has been great in shedding water and snow and keeping my feet dry, and a Certech 4.5 cellular rubber as a midlayer, with a Rottefella® BC sole underneath which allows you to click into NNN bindings - be these on skis or Nordic Skates is up to you! The laces are long but allowed me to fit the boot well to my feet, and the boot is well insulated against the cold from below so that your feet stay toasty when you’re out on the ice.

I wore my <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2012/03/finisterre-zephyr-boxer-shorts.html">Finisterre Boxers</a> till they were broken and the Anatomica have been a worthy replacement. The colours and fit are spot on, sometimes I find the waistband folds over (for example when cycling or climbing) but overall these have been great. The Merino wool makes these my choice of underwear on backpacking trips as you can wear them for several days and they stay fresh, and the flatlock seams &amp; thin material make them very comfortable on the trail. / 51 g in Size M</p>

I found it especially useful in winter when I need to wear my phone close to my body so it stays warm - the battery drains like nothing in the cold - but it can get wet from my sweat. The case has been 100% waterproof thus far and the transparent front lets me operate the phone in it without problems. There’s even a transparent back window so you can take photos through it, and as far as those go I do find the results are satisfactorily.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The common human relationship with winter seems to go like this: As a child you love winter. In your twenties you could life without it. And from your thirties onwards you fall in love with winter &amp; snow again. In our family we’re all winter lovers, and as winter didn’t really visit us in Vaasa we decided to find it up north at <a href="http://ski.pyha.fi/eng/">Pyhä Tunturi</a>.</p>

<h2 id="prologue">Prologue</h2>

<p>Climate change is a real bummer for winter lovers in Southern Finland. While I did get to ski and fatbike in the snow a bit back home, winter in Vaasa was a mix of snow + cold and then rain + warm temperatures which resulted in a less than nice winter. With a week of winter vacation that we could each take of, M and me decided to search winter in Lapland. After some discussions of what we wanted we quickly settled on the <a href="http://ski.pyha.fi/eng/">Pyhä Ski Resort</a> as the best destination for us this year as it had plenty of fun winter activities to offer for all three of us, from skiing and hiking over sledding to ice climbing and fatbiking, with great <a href="http://ski.pyha.fi/accommodation/">accommodation</a> options, too. </p>

<p>A car was rented, <a href="www.airbnb.com/c/hmorkel?s=8">AirBnB accommodation</a> in Oulu was organized and the luggage was packed. It was a nice Sunday morning as we started the drive north, and it was around Oulu - 300 km from Vaasa - that we saw the first signs of Winter again. The next day we continued via a stop in Rovaniemi onwards to Pyhä, and already from a distance we could see the iconic fjells of the ski resort and <a href="http://www.outdoors.fi/pyha-luostonp">National Park</a>, with lots of snow around us and a beautiful bluebird sky promising a great week of winter fun! We checked in to the <a href="http://www.pyha.fi/summer/accommodation/?file=target_exec&amp;id=1128&amp;submenu=3657">Ski-Inn PyhäSuites Apartment</a>, heated up the Sauna and enjoyed seeing the stars in the crisp, black sky.</p>

<h2 id="winter-fun-for-kids">Winter fun for Kids</h2>

<p>We found Pyhä a great location for our three year old. He loved the snow and we were daily at the sled hill, which was a five minutes walk from the <a href="http://www.luontoon.fi/pyha-luostonluontokeskus">Nature Centre Naava</a> (which is in the centre of the village and hence an easy reference point). The two sled hills were good fun and E didn’t get tired of sledding for many hours each day, with little rest breaks at the conveniently located open hut at the foot of the hill. Being allowed to throw another log of wood on the fire was equally nice as making snow angles and sledding together <em>superfast</em> with dad. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16889011560" title="Pyhä Sled Hill by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7713/16889011560_3351fc57fa_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Pyhä Sled Hill" /></a>

<p>There’s a ski school for kids in Pyhä too, though we decided to wait for another year to put him on downhill skis. There were lots of kids skiing, though, and the Family slopes were full with parents and kids of all ages. Close to our apartment was also a reindeer enclosure and visiting Rudolph and his friends was every time again fascinating. E also enjoyed looking how other people skied down the hills so fast, and going up with the Polar Express to the top of the fjell made him smile from ear to ear. </p>

<h2 id="skiing">Skiing</h2>

<p>M and me have the same shoe size, which was convenient as we loaned cross country skis and boots. M enjoyed skiing the tracks while I went a bit off-piste and explored the nearby National Park and swamp on skis. There’s surely a hundred kilometre or more of groomed cross-country skiing tracks at Pyhä and M liked the little huts and Laavus along the tracks, as they were ideal to have a short break and then ski back. The tracks vary in difficulty, from a super easy loipe that goes around a mire with zero elevations to more demanding loipes. You even can ski around the whole Pyhä-Luosto National Park on groomed tracks, which is - depending on the route you choose - between 70 or more kilometres. For early morning and late night skiers there’s also a pretty long illuminated track which is lighted up from 6 in the morning till 23 at night.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17075080162" title="Skiing by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8687/17075080162_2149394d66_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Skiing" /></a></p>

<p>But of course cross-country skiing is just one sort of skiing you can do in Pyhä! It’s very well known in Finland to be <em>the</em> Backcountry destination, as you can take the lift up and then pretty much ski down where you please. Sadly my <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2015/03/ispo-2015-news-3.html">DPS Tour 1 skis</a> didn’t arrive in time otherwise I would have been out on the slopes and made some pretty turns after skinning up the hills. There are lots of great ski-touring options at Pyhä, so if that’s your kind of skiing make sure to take your gear along! Also for downhill and Freeskiers Pyhä is a great destination, with 9 lifts, 14 prepared slopes - the longest slope being 1800 m - and the same ski pass being valid at Ruka as well Pyhä is a great destination to go snowboarding and skiing. Add in that the lifts are working super efficient and queues were non-existent and you have the ingredients for lots of skiing and fun.</p>

<h2 id="ice-climbing">Ice climbing</h2>

<p>One of the reasons why Pyhä won for us as a destination is that you can go <a href="http://www.blissadventure.fi/en/ice-climbing/customized-ice-climbing/">ice climbing at Tajukangas</a> which is a short stroll from the slopes and the Pyhätunturi Hotel. My friends from <a href="http://www.blissadventure.fi/en/">Bliss Adventure</a> run the ice climbing crag there, and I was very happy that my friend <a href="http://aleksimehtonen.fi/">Aleksi</a> and his colleague Mikko were there with me and were the belay masters while I was whacking some ice. And whacking ice I did!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16454119254" title="My first ice lead at Tajukangas by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7665/16454119254_4f6f3c878e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="My first ice lead at Tajukangas" /></a></p>

<p>After a couple of warm-ups and checking out the routes I did my first ice lead ever, and while I was a bit nervous while tying in to my <a href="http://www.bergzeit.fi/en/mammut-genesis-8-5-half-rope-red/?pid=81">Mammut 8.5 Genesis Ropes</a> and racking up the new <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.co.uk/petzl-laser-speed-ice-screw/">Petzl Laser Speed ice screws</a> as soon as I was on the ice and put my mind on the task ahead the fear was gone, tranquility and enjoyment flowing through me. As far as ice leads go this wasn’t the most difficult route ever, though I found the company and encouragement from Aleksi &amp; Mikko superb and they helped me to trust myself and lead on ice. Now I’m hungry for more and hope that next winter will be much better than this one, so that there will be much more ice climbing and leading!</p>

<h2 id="hungry">Hungry?</h2>

<p><a href="http://pyhawurst.fi/">Pyhä Wurst</a> is a cozy little Restaurant/ Café at the bottom of the Northern Slope. They serve, as the name suggest, a variety of different sausages, and all three of us really found our food extremely tasty. Our son devoured a Hotdog - his first one! - and would have liked a second one, while M and me enjoyed a Bratwurst Hotdog and a Riistakäristys. They place was very popular with skiers &amp; snowboarders, walkers, cross-country skiers and families alike, so check them out when you’re in Pyhä and would like to taste some good Wurst!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17050601976" title="PyhäWurst by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8732/17050601976_5f89cb12f4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="PyhäWurst" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.cafeloimu.fi/en/">Café Loimu</a> was another Café which we enjoyed visiting almost daily as they served some super-tasty pancakes and good coffee. They’re located in the same building as the Nature Centre Naava so kids can even go and explore the museum on their own while the parents can enjoy a moment in the Café. Café Loimu is right in the middle of the village and also has an Á la carte Menu if you want to eat a bit more than pancakes or a sandwich.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://ski.pyha.fi/restaurants/?file=target_exec&amp;id=1019&amp;submenu=138">Hotel Pyhätunturi Restaurant</a> has a gorgeous Panorama view over the surroundings and is an ideal place to conclude a nice day outdoors, especially if the Northern Lights decide to show up and play a show over the forests and mires. M ate the best Sautéed reindeer (<em>poronkäristys</em> in Finnish) in her life at the Restaurant and found it so tasty that she still talks about how good it was. I enjoyed <em>The Poro</em> which was equally delicious, while E had problems finishing his kids meal of spaghetti and meatballs. The atmosphere and service at the Hotel Pyhätunturi Restaurant were excellent and if you stay in Pyhä we strongly recommend that you visit the restaurant.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16457137153" title="The Poro by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8686/16457137153_4fe83a661d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="659" alt="The Poro" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.huttu-uula.fi/">Restaurant Huttu-Uula</a> has won an Chaîne des Rôtisseurs award and is located at the foot of the Polar slope. Every Thursday it serves a <a href="http://www.huttu-uula.fi/files/uula_puffee.pdf">Lappish Food Buffet</a> with lots of delicious dishes from Lapland. The friendly atmosphere together with the good buffet food make this a recommended visit on a Thursday evening, though you should reserve well in advance as the Buffet is very popular and was fully booked out when we were there.</p>

<h2 id="fatbiking">Fatbiking</h2>

<p>Since I got my <a href="http://salsacycles.com/bikes/mukluk">Fatbike</a> cycling has been a lot of fun in winter. Riding over the frozen Baltic Sea, shredding over the single track in the forest and doing laps on the groomed trails are just a lot of fun, so of course I took the opportunity to go on a <a href="http://www.blissadventure.fi/en/fatbikes/">Fatbike Adventure at Pyhä</a>. I was very lucky that my friend Artturi was my guide for the morning, and after familiarizing myself with bike and hearing what Artturi had planned for us we hit the trails.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16888790748" title="Fatbiking, skiing or hiking? by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7676/16888790748_0235d89209_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Fatbiking, skiing or hiking?" /></a></p>

<p>After some beautiful, flow-y single track trails we arrived at a large mire which was a lot of fun to ride across. We had a short break at a bird watching tower which allowed for wide views over the National Park, before continuing across the mire - fat tires rock in that terrain! Slowly narrow tracks brought us back to our starting point, and after a nice climb back up to the Hotel this little Fatbike adventure was done. You also can rent a Fatbike for half a day or longer from Bliss in case you want to explore the National Park on your own. Hats off to Bliss Adventure for offering this service, I think they’re spot on with it and I saw daily very happy fatbike cyclists riding on the trails and snow.</p>

<h2 id="snowshoe-hiking">(Snowshoe) Hiking</h2>

<p>There is a dedicated <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2010/01/video-msr-lightning-ascent-review.html">snowshoe</a> hiking trail in Pyhä, though it was so hard packed that one didn’t need snowshoes to walk on it. So we had a nice little family hike to the Isokuru gorge and back, which includes a steep descent and climb from the nice Isokuru Kota. The hike seems to take the route of the summer nature trail as we passed quite a few signs which gave information about the forest and land, and is ideal if you’d like to be outdoors for a couple of hours. </p>

<h2 id="nature--silence">Nature &amp; Silence</h2>

<p>Despite all the activities you can do in Pyhä, there are two things in Pyhä-Luosto everywhere, and they’re for free: Nature and Silence. Even with a Baltic Ski Cup going on while we were in the village, we just needed to walk for five minutes towards the <a href="http://www.outdoors.fi/en/pyha-luostonp">National Park</a> and there was a calmness that was just once in a while interrupted by birdsong or the wind blowing through the trees. Pyhä-Luosto National Park is home to the southern most big fjells in Finland, beyond them towards the south starts the flat land. Though this does make them popular I had at no time the feeling that there were too much people around me, for example the lines at the lifts were pretty much non-existent despite there being a bunch of people, and also in the Cafés and Restaurants there were never masses of people. As someone who values silence a lot I found Pyhä a great place, with easy access to nature and the possibility to <em>“escape”</em> the main slopes and head into the National Park, where even on blue bird days I didn’t meet more than a handful of people. </p>

<h2 id="practicalities">Practicalities</h2>

<p><strong>Where to stay?</strong></p>

<p>We stayed at a <a href="http://www.ski-inn.fi/majoitus.asp?prodtype=30&amp;lang=eng&amp;tunturi=&amp;day=&amp;endDay=">Ski-Inn PyhäSuites Apartment</a> which was ideally located right next to the slopes. The apartment was super family-friendly and had two bedrooms, a small kitchen, living room, balcony, a own Sauna and a drying cabinet to dry wet garments and gear (super handy with kids!). There are plenty more options in town, from the nice <a href="http://www.ski-inn.fi/majoitus.asp?prodtype=41&amp;lang=eng&amp;tunturi=&amp;changeMonth=">Ski-Inn Hotel Pyhätunturi</a> to many, many cozy <a href="http://www.pyha.fi/summer/accommodation/?file=cabins&amp;submenu=3660">cabins</a> and even a <a href="http://www.pyha.fi/summer/accommodation/?file=target_exec&amp;id=1106">caravan site</a> if you’re coming with your own accommodation. You’ll surely find something to your liking, keep an eye out for deals, though, as at e.g. the Ski-Inn PyhäSuites Apartments ski passes can be included in the price saving you a bunch of money!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16869175557" title="PyhäSuites by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7703/16869175557_09002a90bf_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="PyhäSuites" /></a></p>

<p><strong>How to get there?</strong></p>

<p>As we don’t own a car we rented one for a week and drove up north. Vaasa - Pyhä is around 660 km and with a toddler along we decided to split the journey in two and spend a night in Oulu. If you come from abroad you might want to fly directly to Rovaniemi and take the <a href="http://www.pyha.fi/summer/info/?file=content_exec&amp;id=2292&amp;submenu=3890">SkiBus</a> to Pyhä, or take the (overnight) train from Helsinki and then jump on the SkiBus. In the village you can walk pretty much everywhere within 15 minutes, and there’s a variety of shops to suit your needs.</p>
