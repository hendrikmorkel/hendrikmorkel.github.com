<p>I fell in love with Meteora in 2014 before I ever have been there. As the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/01/petzl-roctrip-2014-turkey.html">Petzl RocTrip</a> was announced and I saw the photos from Meteora I knew that it must be a magical place, not only for climbing, but also for just being there, exploring these mountains, hiking through the forests, sucking in the famous Greek hospitality. Things turned out well in 2014 as Petzl invited me on the RocTrip, though I would join it later in Turkey (which is a gorgeous place, too). But then things again turned out well and I was invited to the AdventureNEXT Conference in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/07/multi-adventures-in-macedonia.html">Macedonia</a>, and after my fantastic Pre-Adventure I was super-psyched to finally see the rock towers of Meteora myself. </p>

<p>But before I would lay my eyes on Meteora I and my travel companions were treated to a night in a 5 Star Hotel, a visit in a winery and a sunset hike in the gorgeous mountains of Northern Greece. And after having seen this beauty I’m surprised that most people seem to be thinking about Athens, Kalymnos and the beaches when one mentions Greece. Because Greece is a lot more than those destinations, and it is off-the-beaten track where real adventure awaits. </p>

<h2 id="metsovo">Metsovo</h2>

<p>So our first off-the-beaten-track stop took us to the town of Metsovo. A calm town nestled into the side of the mountain it has a picturesque square where old men meet on Saturday morning to have a chat, narrow cobblestone streets create a maze in which you can get yourself lost and original Tabernas where you are treated to tasty greek food and wine from the <a href="http://www.ariahotels.gr/en/content/katogi/winery-12">Katogi Averoff Winery</a>. That winery we visited, and if you imagine a winery being nothing else than a collection of dusty barrels then you’re in for surprise: Besides barrels full of tasty wine the experience of walking through the wine cellar is similar to walking through a modern art museum, as you will be surprised by each turn of a corner by new colours and art, until you arrive at the bar where you’re sitting down to try the local wines. </p>

<p>After tasting these fine wines we continue our walk through Metsovo, passing fine old houses which enjoy wide views on the mountains around us. Locals eye us curiously and smile when we walk past, a local Taberna being our goal. A few logs burn in the open stove, from the table we enjoy a view into the kitchen, and it doesn’t take the attentive waiter to bring us some tasty starters and glasses of Katogi Averoff Wine. Laughter and smiles fill the room as we eat, and we speculate what might be next in store for our group. </p>

<p>Turns out it is a visit to the new <a href="http://www.grand-forest.gr/en">Grand Forest Metsovo</a> Hotel, which sits above the town and is surrounded by forests. But before enjoying the luxury of a warm shower and a glas of Scottish Whiskey we hit the local trail which starts in front of the hotel. The Ursa Trail is not just a pretty trail which takes one high up the mountain behind the hotel, it also hosts a <a href="http://metsovorace.gr/home-page-en">trailrunning race</a> each spring. My companions descent while I linger high up the mountain, enjoying the far views and the fresh wind in my face. I watch the sun disappear behind the hills, treasuring that memory of the lines of mountains which build up in front of me, like waves in the sea. On the way down I keep up a happy tune, because bears are indeed not seldom here, and I’d rather not be the dinner of Brown Bear tonight.</p>

<p>Back at my room I am enjoying the feeling of hot water on my skin, rubbing down the sweat and dust of a day well spent, and look forward to sit down at the table with my friends for what was a very tasty Dinner. After a final glass of wine we all go down to our suites, laying down on comfy beds and dreaming of the rock pillars of our next destination.</p>

<p>The next day started as sunny and warm as the last one, and after a delicious breakfast at the Grand Forest Metsovo Hotel we check out and board our Minibus to Meteora. It are just a few hours of driving, but already after a while I could make out from high in the mountains the faint outlines of the mountains of Meteora. The closer we got, the more excited I became. I finally would be able to see the rocks of Meteora, hike around, climb them, experience them and will never forget them. And then we were there. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.visitmeteora.travel">Meteora</a>, that are immense monolithic pillars and hills that are composed of sandstone and conglomerate. Small and large pebbles stick out of them, making them one of very few places on this planet where you can see, climb and experience such rocks. And while these rocks themselves are reason enough for many people (<em>climbers!</em>) to visit Meteora, it are the seven active Eastern Orthodox monasteries on top of some of these rocks and their inhabitants which draw many, many more people. My companions and me, we were there for both - and then some. After checking in to my <a href="http://www.guesthouse-sotiriou.gr/en/index.asp">accommodation</a> (see the last photo of my wee house!) and a tasty lunch at the Restaurant Meteora we were hitting the trail up one of the rocks. </p>

<p>Hiking and scrambling up these pillars is a great way to get a feel of the land. We hiked quite a bit over the next few days, through shady Oak forests, past small, hidden monasteries, up unlikely paths with stunning views, never far away from the big monasteries but never meeting another soul out on the trail.</p>

<p>That changed when we went to visit some of the monasteries. There many souls were looking for something, while those living there were sometimes happy enough to pass on ancient wisdom which they have studied in their books. I joined in on these monastery visits, curious to see if an atheist like me can find spiritual enlightenment here, but alas all I found was beautiful architecture and even prettier views on the surrounding nature. Nature is probably as close to my religion as Islam and Buddhism are to others, and as long as we don’t get preachy or hostile with each others I believe we all can happy co-exist on this planet.</p>

<p>And what brings me close to my god? Hiking, packrafting, cycling, flying, skiing and climbing in it. In this case I chose to worship nature by going climbing. Together with my Greek partner Kosta, a local Mountain Guide, we hit up the Pillar of the Rain, an easy 5c route to get me into familiarity with the rock of Meteora. Climbing these routes which are <em>boldly bolted</em> (as in, you better be fine by standing five meters over your last pro) was such an amazing experience, I probably was smiling all the time being able to climb on this fantastic rock. It is just so much fun. Too quick we topped out, leave a note in the summit register and then rappelled down. I could have continued the rest of the day climbing, though I know there will be more days of climbing in Meteora in my future so I have no regrets of not having climbed more that day. </p>

<p>Well, actually we also went scrambling that same morning. Scrambling up on a Via Cordata Tour we were clipped in to ropes while climbing up steep hills, navigating on airy ledges to arrive on a look-out over the city of Kalambaka. It was another great experience of climbing &amp; scrambling among these pillars, and if you’re less inclined to rock climbing then you will surely find this a suitable and safe yet adrenaline-filled adventure.</p>

<p>That brings me to the food, because somehow one has to fuel his body for all these adventures. The meals were delicious, from the Saganaki we ate at Restaurant Meteora, the oldest restaurant in town, which was so tasty, my mouth is watering just writing about it. Or the Gyros we ate off the main street, and many other meals - I can not recall a dish I wasn’t excited about while eating in Greece. The fresh ingredients, the passion &amp; talent of the chefs, the great atmosphere, it all makes eating out in Greece a superb experience - and is very affordable, too. </p>

<p>And too quick to my liking our visit to <a href="https://www.visitmeteora.travel">Meteora</a> was over. Together with my friends Rupert and Bernand I was sitting on a late, sunny afternoon in our bus on the way to Thessaloniki, from where we would fly out the next morning. It was hard to leave this magical place with its friendly people, tasty food, beautiful nature and unique climbing, but I am looking forward to visit again with my family some day soon, and then share this unreal experience with them again.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Winter is coming!</em> And that means for us Families here in the North: Dressing the Kids up warmly and heading out into the snow! </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/30201863754/in/dateposted/" title="Up the Sled Hill"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/6/5734/30201863754_12a9f5a583_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Up the Sled Hill" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Reima Mamid Jacket and Procyon Pants have been our choice of winter garments for our son, and this down-filled jacket and the warm and water-repellant pants have been great in keeping our little boy warm when the temperatures drop low. And low were the temperatures, not just here in Vaasa but also up North in Lapland on our <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/04/winter-family-adventures-in-pyha-luosto.html">Family winter holiday in Pyhä</a> - which is a great place to take your kids for a relaxed &amp; adventurous winter holiday! </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/17075087012/in/album-72157651506091295/" title="That one next, dad!"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7599/17075087012_e945efd6da_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="That one next, dad!" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Mamid jacket has everything you’d expect of your own jacket: Taped seams, windproof, water-proof and a toasty warm insulation of Reima 60 Down (that means there’s a mix of 60% Down to 40% feathers, which I found a good combination as when our son is a lot less careful when he is out playing, and the high feather percentage means the down can do its job and does not get compressed to easily). The hood with the fake fur is great when standing on a cold fjell top or at night when watching the stars and Northern Lights. It can be removed when not needed, which is useful for those chilly but sunny autumn and spring days. The waist can be adjusted by a drawstring on the inside so it is close to the body, and the sleeves have Velcro cuffs so no cold breeze or snow come in. </p>

<p>I don’t know what is the obsession with pockets on Kids garments, maybe the manufacturers just adapt adult designs and make them smaller? At least I feel that most <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/kids-gear/">Kids garments</a> have too many pockets. The Mamid for example would have been fine with just the two large flap pockets, eliminating the zippered pockets on the chest and inside. These just don’t get used by kids of the age 3 to 5 and add unnecessary material and costs to the garment. On the other hand, great are the reflective details on the jacket - though there could be possibly be some more, especially on the right sleeve there could also be a patch like on the left one. As for the freedom of movement, the Mamid was great for all our activities, from sledding to walking and climbing on rocks. The material is durable and abrasion-resistant and still looked like new after a season in the snow. </p>

<p>In short, if he’d not out-grown it so quickly he’d still be wearing it - also because he really liked his red winter jacket! Good thing his little sister will be able to wear it in a year or two and then I can go sledding with her =) The <a href="https://www.reima.com/fi/Koululaisten-lastenvaatteet/Ulkovaatteet/Ulkotakit/Talvitakit/Lasten-Reimatec®%2B--talvitakki-Serkku/p/531235-3830">Reimatec Serkku Winter Jacket</a> is the successor to the Mamid Jacket so if you’re still looking for a warm, durable and stylish jacket for your little one - we can recommend this one completely!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16889011560/in/album-72157651506091295/" title="Pyhä Sled Hill"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7713/16889011560_3351fc57fa_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Pyhä Sled Hill" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>That brings us to the pants which we got together with the jacket, the <a href="https://www.reima.com/fi/Syysuutuudet/Lasten-toppahousut-Procyon/p/522207N-6980">Procyon pants</a>. These are also well-constructed, robust and still look very good after a winter season of abuse. While the suspenders are a bit tricky when our son was supposed to dress up himself, they ensured the pants stayed where they belong when we were outside, and the small bib added also a wee bit of warmth. There could have been some more reflective details on them (there are, but not enough in my opinion) as especially now in November it is so dark and more visibility is always good. </p>

<p>The pants have great freedom of movement, climbing and running in them was no problem, and the taped seams made them highly water-repellant and windproof. The stretchy inside trouser cuffs ensured no snow came into his boots and socks and are adjustable in width - together with the Velcro adjusters on the outside trouser legs these mean no snow or dirt has a chance. The two side pockets were again never used and could be eliminated, but otherwise these were great, warm pants when playing in the snow. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/30201863854/in/dateposted/" title="Stay here!"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/6/5346/30201863854_580e6c896f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Stay here!" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Overall we were very happy with the two winter garments from Reima (and the many other ones we have bought!) and it is great to support &amp; work together with a Finnish Company which makes so good clothes for kids. Winter is arriving all over Europe, so now is a good time to get those warm, durable and stylish kids garments so the little ones can continue to play outside. <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/marken/reima/?pid=10239">Bergfreunde</a> have a wide selection of Reima garments, and you also can buy everything directly at the <a href="https://www.reima.com/">Reima Online Shop</a> or visit a <a href="https://www.reima.com/fi/myymalat">local Reima Retailer</a>. </p>

<p>Not only <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/10/blogger-communications-how-to-contact-bloggers.html">companies contact bloggers</a>, also bloggers contact companies to work together with them together. I have often contacted companies thus have plenty of experience of what is good &amp; works well, but also know from personal conversations with companies &amp; agencies that not all Emails are crafted as meticulously, sometimes even bordering on the outright rude. So don’t be that blogger, remember the good manners your parents thought you and show off your best side when you contact a company when <em>you want something from them</em>. Instead of giving you a pre-made template of an Email, here are the points which I know should be in there - use them to create your own unique contact email.</p>

<h2 id="the-contact-email">The Contact Email</h2>

<p><em>Hei XYZ,</em> - Do your research and find out who would be the right person to contact. Sometimes these can be found from the company’s website, sometimes you need to hone your Search Skills and use other tools. <strong>Tip:</strong> LinkedIn can be a good way to find the right contact person in a company.</p>

<p><em>My Name is ABC and I write the GDI Blog.</em> - ALWAYS start off with an introduction. You would do this in real life when you meet someone the first time, do this also when you contact someone out of the blue. <strong>Tip:</strong> Yes, that’s a good place to put a link to your blog in there. And if you’re an Instagrammer, Youtuber or have a super-popular Maillinglist, switch blog for your medium. </p>

<p><em>I’m contacting you because…</em> - Tell them why you want to work with that company. Be creative but sensible. The person you’re writing to probably gets twenty Cooperation inquiry Emails a day, so try to stand out from the crowd. Be funny, unique, creative. This should concentrate on the company, not the product - that comes next. </p>

<p><em>I’m interested in testing your CDI trousers on my next Yukon thru-hike because…</em> - Now you pitch the product you’d like to test. Be specific in your test goal and it is good to straight away mention Size &amp; Colour you are interested in. If you’re going to “only” test the item on day hikes through your local wood that might be less attractive as a trip where the receiver can imagine that great images would come out. </p>

<p><em>I would review the pants…</em> - State what you offer for the item. Are it Instagram photos? A video? A blog post? All of that? What’s the time-frame (within 5 weeks, after 4 months, after a year)? Be as specific and detailed as possible.</p>

<p><em>Usually I charged XXX €$£ for a review, but because this is our first cooperation I’m happy to offer a Discount.</em> - Yes, even when you ask a company for an item you should name your price. You can but don’t need to offer a discount, that’s up to you. Just don’t sell yourself for free.</p>

<p><em>My Unique Readers a month are XXX and the Engagement is XXX. For detailed information, please view the attached Mediakit.</em> - The key numbers of your medium (Blog, IG, Mailinglist, etc.) should be in the Email so the receiver can have an idea of the size of your blog, while your Mediakit should be attached. If you don’t have a Mediakit attach a screenshot of your Analytics programme of the current month and name the Social Media channels you play on including numbers. And then get started on making that Mediakit!</p>

<p><em>Finally, I’m also a Signee of the <a href="http://www.outdoorbloggercodex.com/en/?noredirect=en_US">Outdoor Blogger Codex</a> and am transparent in my tests.</em> - This shows the receiver that you are working professional and adhere to legal rules &amp; requirements. </p>

<p><em>I’m looking forward to hear from you and remain with…</em> - Remember the friendly and professional attitude we mentioned at the beginning? That continues until the last sentence!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29902998894/in/dateposted/" title="Vancouver at night"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8571/29902998894_25c96d4288_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Vancouver at night" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="more-pro-tips">More Pro Tips</h2>

<p>K.I.S.S. - Keep It Short and Simple. Long Emails don’t get read, be as concise as possible - this shows you also value the time of the receiver.</p>

<p>I said it before, and I say it again: Also small blogs can contact companies for a cooperation because they can offer unique perspectives or a high engagement with their readers. If you just started a blog - don’t worry, you’re probably creating great content with a unique view, so don’t be shy!</p>

<p>If your blog is really outstanding - like it has won meaningful Awards - you can mention this. It should be something the receiver is familiar with. </p>

<p>Have you worked already with other brands together? Great! Mention a partner or two (preferably not from the same category - If you have tested trousers from company JKL and wrote a glowing review and now ask for another pair of trousers that might seem strange) as this shows that you’re a trust-worthy blogger that delivers what he promises.</p>

<p>If it is a product that has just been announced at a trade show chances are that there’s no samples yet, or very limited ones. Generally I have the feeling that companies prefer to have their new products reviewed, so if you ask to test a five-year old Bestseller that has won Magazine Awards your chances are very slim. In that case you’re better off pitching a cooperation to an outdoor shop.</p>

<p>Speaking of outdoor shops, these can be great cooperation partners. Emails to them are similar as this one and you can adapt these ideas just a little to get your foot into the door.</p>

<p>Your complete contact details - address &amp; phone number should be in the Email, also Skype or similar. Some people prefer to pick up the phone and give you a call, plus it adds more credibility. </p>

<p>Finally, lets imagine you totally hate the product you were sent. Instead of writing a negative review you should get in touch with the company or agency, explain the situation and ask them what they think you should do. On the one side you might want to warn your readers about the product, but on the other hand it might be that you used it wrongly, it was a pre-production sample, or something else. Work out a beneficial solution out with your partner which both can life with. </p>

<p><strong>The Bottomline</strong> is that when you contact a company or PR Agency you should do your research well. Know who to write to, be friendly in your Email as good manners go a long way to getting you what you want, and be as concise as possible. If done well the receiver will feel lucky that just you contacted them and help them do their job better. You want to create a win-win-win situation, where the company, you and your readers benefit from this cooperation.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Winter is coming</em>. And that means I’ll again step into the bindings of my DPS Wailer Tour1 Skis, skin up a fine mountain, put down my heel and flow through the pow!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26148754403/in/album-72157665452784994/" title="At the summit"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/2/1681/26148754403_5dff0ce1e6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="At the summit" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Picking my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/gear-of-the-year/">Gear of the Year</a> isn’t easy: There’s a lot of equipment that comes over my table (happily a lot <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/01/zero-gear-year.html">less this year</a>) and while that alone isn’t what makes it hard, it’s those favourites which I have used for many years which make it difficult, as these favourites are always strong contenders for my Gear of the Year Award. But while I really love my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/luna-sandals-oso.html">Luna Sandals</a> it is my <a href="http://www.dpsskis.com/en/skis/browse-skis-by-shape/all-mountain-mixed-snow/wailer-430.html">DPS Wailer Tour1 Skis</a> which I chose this year, because of two reasons: 1. They allow me to be more in the mountains and 2. They’re some of the lightest ski-touring skis on the market. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25738443973/in/album-72157664672954972/" title="Tools of joy!"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/2/1598/25738443973_d7b1af966a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Tools of joy!" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>These skis (as well as the <a href="https://www.bergzeit.de/g3-ion-12-tourenbindung-16-17/?pid=81">bindings</a>, <a href="https://www.bergzeit.de/contour-hybrid-free-split-skins-skifell-s/?pid=81">skins</a> and <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/04/la-sportiva-spectre.html">boots</a>) have accompanied me to Canada, South Tyrol, Austria, Finnish Lapland, Switzerland and <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/05/lyngen.html">Norway</a> and I have stood almost 30 days on them. Thirty days in the wintery mountains, that’s pretty sweet in my book. Simply because in my book a day spent in the mountains is a day well spent. And if I can be active, skin up a mountain with good friends, smile together at the summit and then put down my heel to carve a fine line into the fresh powder, well, I can imagine few things which would be better in winter &amp; which make me so happy.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25105375706/in/album-72157664672954972/" title="I like crust, but I only like it on Crème brûlée"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/2/1676/25105375706_0f539523c5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="I like crust, but I only like it on Crème brûlée" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I was skiing with my brother in South Tyrol and we went on a ski-tour while it was dumping snow. We were the only ones out that day, and as we reached that cabin down there, sat down in it and drunk some hot tea, we didn’t care that the summit would be some other 20 minutes of skining further up the mountain. We sat there, sweaty, smiling, munching a chocolate bar, and looking forward to ski down through that fresh powder. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24460363514/in/album-72157664166747400/" title="I love me a nice cabin!"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/2/1466/24460363514_7edaab5590_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="I love me a nice cabin!" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I Switzerland Anselm, Willi and me wanted to complete the <a href="http://www.hauteroute-graubuenden.ch">Graubünden Haute Route</a> but conditions conspired against us. While this winter wasn’t particularly good the week we were in Switzerland the Avalanche Danger was so high that we weren’t able to do the complete Haute Route. That didn’t hinder us from having a grand time in the Swiss Mountains, staying with some fantastic hut wardens, skiing some great lines and feeling happy while standing on our skis. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26436513541/in/album-72157665020355632/" title="Boot-packing up"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/2/1490/26436513541_8e1264ac4b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Boot-packing up" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The <a href="http://bit.ly/2eUHSEx">DPS Wailer Tour1 Skis</a> are award winning skis which are Made in Utah, USA. They’re ultralight at 1.410 g per ski and 184 cm length, which is great when you’re having days with lots of ascent - the low weight is very energy saving. You’ll float through powder with a smile on your face and will be happy on spring crust - through stay off-piste as that’s the one thing they don’t really like (and weren’t made for). But powder, well, you’ll surf through it, make ace turns and throw up some cold smoke that you wish will never end. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25816133670/in/album-72157665518007630/" title="Backcountry fun on Jyppyrä, Hetta Hiihtomaa"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/2/1675/25816133670_564e5094cc_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Backcountry fun on Jyppyrä, Hetta Hiihtomaa" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>So, that possibility - to surf through a meter of fresh snow and then skin back up to take a 2nd run - that’s why I love my <strong>DPS Wailer Tour1 Skis</strong> and that’s why they are my <strong>Gear of the Year</strong>. I’m sure they will allow me to collect a lot more of fine winter mountain skiing memories, and for that I am grateful. </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Popular Bloggers get daily Emails that offer them to test, promote and try products &amp; services, with the hope that we really like and write about them &amp; let you, our readers know. Sadly the majority of these Emails are so poorly constructed and researched that it is time to give PR Agencies, shops and manufacturers a hint on how to talk with us.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/30417085222/in/dateposted/" title="Light and Darkness"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/6/5734/30417085222_857935f2cc_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Light and Darkness" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>This Email and post came about as a friend asked me for advice on <em>how to contact bloggers</em>. That friends runs a small company in Germany, I have met him several times in person and have used their products (they’re one of my favourites). It’s rare that I get an Email asking me - how should I contact you if I want to cooperate with you? The majority of Email writers assumes I have just been waiting for them and their AwesomeOutdoorProduct, not knowing it existed in the first place. I’ve studied at the University a Master’s Degree where I learned about doing my research, so if I dive into something I research that topic in-depth and try to know as much as possible about it. This is what I expect from people contacting me, too. </p>

<p>But back to that Email to my friend. Here’s what I told him, published in public so that other companies can up their game and also that fellow bloggers have something they can refer companies to when they receive a bad Email.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-contact-bloggers">How to contact bloggers</h2>

<p>As a company I only would cooperate with bloggers which have signed the <a href="http://www.outdoorbloggercodex.com/en/?noredirect=en_US">Outdoor Blogger Codex</a>. This are bloggers which work transparent, adhere to legal requirements and are honest to their readers. They’re also pretty good bloggers that write about authentic experiences and are not afraid to write if something was sub-par. Most of all these bloggers try to work as professionally as possible, even if their blog is only a hobby, which means partners can expect a certain level of professionalism.</p>

<p>So after you have browsed the Outdoor Blogger Codex and have found a blogger you think is a good fit, the important part starts: Research. Find out which Social Media Channels the blogger uses, if she was somewhere just on tour, what was her last Instagram Story, etc. The more you find out about the blogger before writing that first Email the better. Then it’s time to draft that Email which aims to make a good impression and offer something from which both parties can benefit. It could look something like this: </p>

<hr />

<p><br />
<em>Hei Hendrik,</em></p>

<p><em>my name is XYZ and I work for AwesomeOutdoorBrand. While doing research about the topic of <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/05/lyngen.html">ski-touring in Lyngen</a> I found your article and I thought your photos &amp; story from that trip were really great. We, AwesomeOutDoorBrand, produce an GreatOutdoorProduct and would like it if you’d feel like taking it along on your next ski-tour and also test it as extensively and write about it as you did with [<a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/gear-reviews/">Mention suitable &amp; similar article or review</a>].</em> </p>

<p><em>We know that bloggers invest a lot of time and enthusiasm into their articles and we would pay you in addition to the GreatOutdoorProduct which you’re allowed to keep also XXX €£$, as you probably already have some GreatOutdoorProducts in your gear closet - but those one can’t eat, as we know. Of course you’d have full editorial control in your texts, and we love to also hear constructive critiscm - because even if we try to make a perfect product it might not suit you, and probably there’s always something that can be improved. Time-wise we would like to possibly read something in three to four months from you as it takes time to test equipment as in-depth as you do.</em></p>

<p><em>When the article is online and it fits our Social Media Guidelines we also would like to share it on our channels, as we’re sure our Fans would be curious to read what you think about our GreatOutdoorProduct. And if you love our GreatOutdoorProduct we also could talk about a long-term partnership, if we both have the feeling that we fit well together. I’m looking forward to hear from you and remain with</em> </p>

<p><em>Happy trails,</em></p>

<p><em>*XYZ</em></p>

<h2 id="the-thinking-that-went-into-that-email">The thinking that went into that Email</h2>

<p>As bloggers we do like it if people read our articles, so referencing something we have published is a great opener. Just please really read the article and not just look for a suitable headline. </p>

<p>We get daily offers to test something, of which I delete 95% as they’re not on topic (I would not be able to credibly review something that doesn’t fit in with the topic of my blog). If one contacts a blogger make sure the topic is in lines with the blog’s - for me that’d be <em>Outdoor Adventure Travel</em> by fair means.</p>

<p>The payment for the work should be appropriate - that is generally everything from 150€ upwards. That might appear like a lot, but for a good review one might need three or more days - producing good photos, writing &amp; researching the text, and testing the product in its intended environment.</p>

<p>Reach is important (you can <a href="http://brandsome.fi/brand/hikinginfinland">see Hiking in Finland’s current Social Media Reach here</a>) and it’s clear most companies want to reach as many people as possible. However, one should not rule out working with smaller blogs that maybe are just starting out - they can have an even better engagement as large blogs, and are a great possibility to maybe work with the Digital Influencer of tomorrow.</p>

<p>Also feel free to ask for the Mediakit - every good blogger should have one and if not should have no problem with sending you a current screenshot of Google Analytics or similar. </p>

<p>Of course one doesn’t need to offer something in the first Email at all, butt as many bloggers have a job, family and limited time it might be good to come directly to the point instead of asking for a Mediakit. After all there’s tools out there that lets one find out <a href="https://www.similarweb.com/">how many visitors a blog has</a> and while these are not always accurate they give you an idea. </p>

<p><strong>The Bottomline</strong> is to research before you contact, communicate on the same level with the person you’re writing to and treat their time as valuable. Nothing is more annoying than a copy &amp; pasted, standardised Email which has nothing to do with what I do and wastes my time. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29902999164/in/dateposted/" title="Coffee"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8640/29902999164_eb71cd2dfc_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Coffee" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I’ll write more about the topic of how to cooperate with bloggers in the future, if you’re able to read German you might want to already read <a href="http://ulligunde.com/2016/03/zum-umgang-mit-bloggern-teil-1-offtopic/">Erika’s post</a> on these issues and also subscribe to the <a href="http://blogchamps.de">BlogChamps</a> Newsletter (again, in German).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>What camera do you use?</em> is probably the most common question I am asked when out on a trip or when someone sees my photos, and an astounding expression is often the result when I show my Sony RX100 IV - a pocket camera. But because size &amp; weight matter ever less in the fast evolving world of photography, the results of this small camera speak for it - be it here on the blog or in print magazines. <em>A comprehensive Field Report.</em></p>

<h2 id="tldr">tl;dr</h2>

<p><em>The Sony RX100 IV is the camera you want to document your adventures when you prefer light weight, a small size and superb image quality.</em></p>

<h2 id="what-i-want-from-a-camera-and-how-i-ended-up-choosing-the-rx100-iv">What I want from a camera (and how I ended up choosing the RX100 IV)</h2>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: I bought the RX 100 IV myself and have no affiliation with Sony.</p>

<p>This blog started out about my backpacking trips in Finland &amp; my journey to lighten up the load on my back when outdoors, and has morphed into what I call an Outdoor Adventure Travel Blog nowadays. But I remember my Ultralight roots in everything I start, from <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2012/06/bikepacking-in-pirkanmaa.html">bikepacking</a> to mountaineering, <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2011/08/ultralight-climbing.html">climbing</a> and <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/04/packing-for-ski-touring.html">ski-touring</a>. I have dabbled with big, heavy cameras, used M43s like the still superb <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2010/04/panasonic-lumix-gf1-field-report.html">Panasonic Lumix GF1</a>, graduated to the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/10/sony-a7r-field-report.html">Sony A7R full-frame camera</a>, had a short affair with the Olympus OM-D E-M5 and its successor and then just simply returned to what I consider the best camera for outdoor enthusiasts &amp; photographers who are outside, the subject of this article, the Sony RX100 IV. I enjoyed its predecessor, the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/02/sony-rx100iii-field-report.html">RX 100 III</a>, but haven’t pulled the trigger on my RX100 IV till last year December, when I ordered it on <a href="http://amzn.to/2eUfshc">Amazon</a>. </p>

<p><em>Why did I buy the RX 100 IV?</em> you might ponder, a valid question as do I own some other <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/photography/">cameras</a> too. Well, that’s where the ultralight thought comes up again. I wanted something that I can put in a pocket and is light. While I love the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/10/gear-of-the-year-2015-peak-design-capture-pro-camera-clip.html">Peak Design Capture Pro</a> I have been out a lot in weather which has been anything than sunshine &amp; blue sky, and while I could add a <a href="https://www.peakdesign.com/product/covers/shell/?coupon_code=hikeinfin">Shell Cover</a> I prefer to keep it simple. And what is simpler than putting your camera into the chest pocket of your hardshell? After this lengthy introduction, let me quote myself:</p>

<p><em>“I’m still looking for the *Eierlegende Wollmilchsau</em> in terms of photographic equipment. It’s the camera which has only advantages, satisfies all my needs and is good enough for all my requirements”*:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Print-quality photographs</li>
  <li>Nightshots possible</li>
  <li>Video capable</li>
  <li>Tiltscreen</li>
  <li>Long battery life</li>
  <li>Easy to use</li>
  <li>Lightweight</li>
  <li>Weatherproof</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>

<p>Before delving into these points and others in detail, let me first highlight the disadvantages of the RX 100 IV: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Only F11</li>
  <li>No hotshoe for a microphone or similar</li>
  <li>The Video Microphone is not good in real wind</li>
  <li>Included Flash in underpowered</li>
  <li>Menu is a bit unorganized and could be clearer</li>
  <li>No touch screen</li>
  <li>Tedious to switch focus point at times</li>
  <li>Back screen scratches easily</li>
  <li>No charger included</li>
  <li>Camera has sometimes difficulties with very bright or grey skies</li>
</ul>

<p>Now lets look at these in a bit more detail.</p>

<p><em>Only F11</em>. That might not seem like a big complaint, but for someone like me who loves sun stars F11 is often not enough. Add  some clouds or something to the sky and you can pretty much be sure that the RX100 IV is gonna make it a glowing white ball in the sky. When the sky is clear, however, it does produce acceptable sunstars: </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28044201296/in/album-72157669978279411/" title="Santa&#x27;s Cabin in Levi"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7797/28044201296_a750b77c3b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Santa&#x27;s Cabin in Levi" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><em>No hotshoe for a microphone or similar</em>. I really, really, really wish Sony would have said <em>We don’t need no underpowered flash in this camera, but lets put on a Hotshoe</em> because honestly, for me this camera is aimed at professionals, videography and photography enthusiasts who have the accessories which would need a hotshoe. This goes hand-in-hand with the next two complaints: </p>

<p><em>The Video Microphone is not good in real wind</em> and <em>Included Flash in underpowered</em>. Watch the underneath video and wait five seconds after the intro and see how useless the microphone is in real wind - and this is with wind cancellation et al. activated. If I would have been able to attach my beloved <a href="http://amzn.to/2eAihzK">Rode VideoMic</a> you could have understood me clear like in an empty studio, but so the wind is pretty much drowning me out completely. Also the underpowered flash is next-to-useless and I’d rather would not have it on the camera - I have NEVER used it - and have the possibility to attach a real flash via a hotshoe. I hope that in Version VI of this camera Sony will give it a Hotshoe, because that would make it even more versatile.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1ZN99LOKqjQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>The <em>Menu is a bit unorganized and could be clearer</em> is something most camera manufacturers seem to have problems with if I read or watch reviews. It’d be nice to be able to create an own “My Menu” point where I could add these Menu points which are important to me so that I can access them fast instead of trying to find them in the buried Menu structure. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29900767693/in/dateposted/" title="Sony RX100 IV Menu"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/6/5608/29900767693_c7380e2ab6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Sony RX100 IV Menu" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>That there’s <em>No touch screen</em> is a problem if you want to again quickly navigate through the Menu, or, even more important, set the Focus point somewhere. Because it can be <em>Tedious to switch the focus point at times</em> as you a) need to be in the right Focus Mode and b) then need to push the button and then navigate it with the wheel to where you want it. With a touchscreen I ideally would put my finger where I want the focus to be and <em>Voilá!</em> I could shoot. So I often need to try very fast to switch the focus point when my subject is moving. </p>

<p>Lets stay with the back of the camera for one more moment, as the <em>Back screen scratches easily</em>. It’s purely optical - probably the protective layer on it - but it’s still a bit annoying. After all this is a 1.200€ camera, and you’d expect that the screen is scratch resistant - it is a pocket camera, after all. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/30417089442/in/dateposted/" title="Sony RX100 IV Scratched scree"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/6/5542/30417089442_7990889a3d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Sony RX100 IV Scratched scree" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>What really has me scratching my head is why Sony did not <em>include a charger</em> in the package. You can <a href="http://amzn.to/2emViNX">buy one</a> but it feels strange to spend almost 20€ on something that should be included. You can charge the battery otherwise via the included USB cable, but that also means you can not use the camera to shoot. This is a short-sighted and unfriendly customer policy which I really don’t like, and I hope the next RX100 cameras will come with a charger included. </p>

<p>Which bring me to the final complaint, and here we enter the technical capabilities of the camera. It <em>sometimes has difficulties with very bright or grey skies</em> aka <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range#Photography">Dynamic Range</a>, or in layman terms: If there’s a dark foreground and a very bright background (or vice versa). While the Sony RX100 IV has a built in, electronic ND Filter which can help with making the image better, it only helps so much (and you need to remember to switch it on). Happily this is something I usually am able to fix in <a href="http://amzn.to/2eJtrTR">Lightroom and Photoshop</a> afterwards as I always photograph in RAW. If you can’t fix it then images come out like this, though:</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/30497509756/in/dateposted/" title="High Dynamic Range Anyone?"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8618/30497509756_a663420ddf_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="High Dynamic Range Anyone?" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Which looks OK but you have no idea what’s happening in the foreground. </p>

<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>

<p>So, these are my complaints about the camera, which I hope Sony will fix in the next versions of this camera. Thus onwards to the positive sides of the RX100 IV, which really shine. </p>

<p>Print-quality photographs ✓</p>

<p>Besides Hiking in Finland I write for over a dozen of magazines and while that could be an excuse to splurge on a Full-Frame camera and some fancy lenses it really isn’t needed nowadays. The RX100 IV produces superb photos for print, with all the details and colours you’d want. Even if I was out on an assignment for clients I just stood by the fact that I have this wee camera and not a heavy DSLR to shot for them, and once they saw the images there never has been a complaint. I know that I am very lucky with my clients which are open-minded, and that sometimes you just have to show up with a DSLR to a gig to look the part, but as I usually work on my own I really don’t need to impress anyone with the size of my camera. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26160876304/in/album-72157665452784994/" title="Fjord sunset"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/2/1489/26160876304_454bd5c53c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Fjord sunset" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Nightshots possible  ✓</p>

<p>I love me some pretty night shots. Standing out in the cold and dark, starring at the stars, maybe shivering a wee bit - that’s me feeling alive, small, happy and behind my camera, taking photos of these stars and Northern Lights. Or of impressive city scapes, like last December as <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/09/arcteryx-workshop-tour.html">I visited Arc’teryx in Vancouver</a>. It sometimes feels a bit like hit-and-miss with the focus, but if the focus is spot-on then the tiny camera produces great images of nightscapes.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29902998894/in/dateposted/" title="Vancouver at night"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8571/29902998894_25c96d4288_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Vancouver at night" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/30446319961/in/dateposted/" title="Night in the Dolomites"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5805/30446319961_84734d2be7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Night in the Dolomites" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Video capable ✓</p>

<p>The Sony RX100 IV can shoot 4K Movies, which is the next step up from 1080 HD. It’s pretty heavy on the Memory Cards (you might want to bring a 128GB card or three) but if it is something you need you will be delighted to know it is possible. I shot at 1080 HD and that’s plenty good, too, and is a lot friendlier for data storage. You can see the <a href="https://youtu.be/1ZN99LOKqjQ">MSR Access 2 Video</a> above for an example of the camera’s video capabilities. I have to say that I find it annoying that Movies can only be recorded when the tiny red Movie button on the back is pushed AND the programme wheel is in Movie mode - if the latter is e.g. in Manuel mode you’ll get a warning on the screen. I would like that I also could start videos by push the shutter button, as that would make sense if the programme wheel is on Movies. </p>

<p>Tilt-able screen? ✓</p>

<p>While I always carry a tripod and a remote Selfies are a great way to be up-close in a photo, and for videos it’s very useful to see yourself when you’re filming. The screen on the RX100 IV can be tilted fully up which is great for Selfies and filming. It can be tilted around 45° downwards which makes it useful for shooting over your head, for example if you’re in a crowd and want to get a good angle from thw back</p>

<p>Long battery life ✓</p>

<p>Oh wow, the battery life. Is. <strong>AMAZING</strong>. When other reviewers complain about the poor battery life of the RX100 IV I can only wonder what they’re doing, but I took in winter, at -5°C outside temperature, 1.200 photos with the RX100 IV on the mountain and the camera’s battery was still half full. On the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/10/autumn-backpacking-in-the-dolomites.html">Dolomites trip</a> this month I used one battery on average for three days and around 1.500 photos. These are amazing stats for me as I know that with a full battery in the camera and a back-up battery in the chest pocket of my baselayer I can be out a full day and shoot whatever comes my way without needing to worry to run out of juice. I even can browse the photos in the evening and send a shot or five via the in-built Wifi to my phone where I can edit it in the Lightroom and Photoshop Apps before uploading the days shot to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hendrikm/">Instagram</a>. Seriously, the battery life is out-of-this-world and if you’re an occasional shooter you probably can go on a week long trip and shoot all you want to shoot without needing to worry that the battery runs out. </p>

<p>Easy to use ✓</p>

<p>One of the main reasons to get a small camera is that it is easier to use, especially for people that don’t want to dive into deep Menus. The Auto Mode on the RX100 IV is really good and I occasionally use it with great success - often indoors when the lightning is difficult, but also outdoors it produces very good images. You can put it on Auto Mode and give it a friend in the hand and he’ll be fine to take good photos. Pop-up the EVF if it’s bright out there and they will be able to compose the shot via it without problems. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24772101730/in/album-72157664166747400/" title="Powder Shower"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/2/1441/24772101730_36bd02d8e3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Powder Shower" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Lightweight ✓</p>

<p>The camera without SD Card and battery is 262 g light, an original Sony battery weighs 24 g and the SD card is 2 g, which means the functioning camera weighs 288 g. I added a wee hand lop which weighs 3 g, so that brings it up to 291 g. Lighter is just using a phone camera (which are not even close as good as the RX100 IV, see further underneath) or no camera at all. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26634869063/in/album-72157666107618714/" title="Cave Gorna Slatinska 13"><img src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/8/7265/26634869063_296b974bce_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Cave Gorna Slatinska 13" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Weatherproof ✓</p>

<p>While Sony doesn’t advertize the RX100 IV as highly weatherproof it has been just that in my experience. I had it out in snow and rain storms - and because that’s when you’re getting the best photos I of course also had the camera out in that weather. It has no problems with getting wet, and even when moisture has collected on the lens and the extendable lens, I never had a failure on it. Sure, this all has been with care and I wouldn’t hold the camera under a waterfall, but for quick shots in the snow and rain the RX100 IV is more than enough weatherproof. I also don’t have a case for it - I 99% of the time carry it in my hand or chest pocket, so that’s all the weather protection it has had over the last ten months. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24460363514/in/album-72157664166747400/" title="I love me a nice cabin!"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/2/1466/24460363514_7edaab5590_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="I love me a nice cabin!" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Another advantage is that the camera has an Electronic Viewfinder. This makes the camera look more like an old-fashioned film camera, which is really useful in street photography when you want to shoot people and not awaken the impression it’s a digital camera. Also for portraits I find the EVF great as it allows the subjects to take you more serious &amp; relax while you’re behind the camera, instead of looking on a screen in front of you. It’s also so small that I can hold it in my hand and shot from the hip, or place it inconspicuously on a table and take a photo of a situation.</p>

<p>One thing I love is the possibility of sending via In-built Wifi photos from the camera to my phone, where I can edit it in Lightroom &amp; Photoshop and upload it to Instagram. Gone the times where one needs to first upload everything to the Mac, then edit it there and then transfer it somehow back to the phone. The App and Wifi work great once set up, and is used often and with pleasure. </p>

<p>Where I’m already talking about my phone: <em>How’s the Sony RX100 IV in comparison to the iPhone 6S?</em> you might ponder. I bought the iPhone 6S (800+€) because I thought the camera in that phone finally has reached a level which is great. How wrong I was. Sure, the iPhone 6S is still lighter and smaller than the Sony camera, but there’s World’s between these two devices in photographic terms. I am very disappointed by the quality of the iPhone 6S photos as I expected a lot better quality, but especially in the above mentioned High Dynamic Range situations - think sunsets and sunrises - the iPhone 6S comes not even close in quality to what the Sony RX100 IV can do. The iPhone simply overburdened with a lot of photographic situations, and even if Apple tries to make us think otherwise - I wouldn’t spend so much money on an iPhone ever again. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26741128546/in/dateposted/" title="Sunset"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/2/1508/26741128546_756a100b4c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Sunset" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Bikepacking with the Sony RX100 IV is great. I had it along on a few trips where I was riding tours for magazine stories, and capturing the environment &amp; action while on the bike, hands on a handlebar, is still a bit different than hiking, ski-touring or climbing. I stored the camera in my <a href="http://www.ovejanegrathreadworks.com/12-packtrade-frame-bag.html">Oveja Negra 1/2 Pack</a> where it fitted in with all the other kit I have in there. It’s very easy to get out of there - with one hand! - and allows me to capture situations from the bike in around 15 seconds max. I also can fit in my tripod and remote in the 1/2 Pack, and can set things up in a minute or two, which is great for those photos where I + bike need to be completely in the frame. I have experimented with a few cameras on bikepacking &amp; cycle-touring trips and the RX100 IV has been my favourite by far because it is so convenient to use when on (and off) the bike. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22836352233/in/album-72157659581645884/" title="Mandatory cycling selfie"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5817/22836352233_1fb4de4f0d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Mandatory cycling selfie" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And at the end, still some words on durability. I now have the RX100 IV since December 2015 in use, and it has been with me on at least 14 trips where it has been in the cold, bumped against rocks while climbing, hiked in the sleet and snow of the Dolomites, endured 35°C in Greece and two trade fairs. I have shot well over 27.000 images with it in these ten months, and while it feels that it doesn’t start up as fast anymore as when it was new it still functions as great as on Day one. I expect that I’ll get another year or two of use out of this camera - although I am tempted to update to the RX100 V which was announced a couple of weeks ago as it fixes some of my complaints. But even if I don’t update, I think that a small camera like this one, which has seen so much use and the only <em>“damage”</em> it has taken are scratches on the back screen and some chipped paint, is speaking for the high quality of the Sony RX100 IV.</p>

<h2 id="the-accessories">The Accessories</h2>

<p>Accessories I carry along include always a second <a href="http://amzn.to/2emiMQU">SanDisk Extreme 64GB SDXC Card</a>, as they have an amazing price-to-quality ratio and the write speed of 90MB/ second is great for long bursts. 64GB can last for up to a week of being outdoors and a wee video in between. If I know I will shot more video or lots, and lots of photos, then I’ll take two or three extra cards along - at 30€ a card I consider them pretty affordable (I wish <a href="http://amzn.to/2eJBvUV">External Storage</a> would be as cheap!).</p>

<p>My <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/03/velbon-v-pod.html">Velbon V-Pod</a> is still usually along as I might want to take night photos, videos or need to be in the photo and have no-one around to take a photo of me. I also bought a <a href="http://amzn.to/2eAjUzM">Pixel RW221 Remote</a> which is very good - you can be up to 100 m away and still operate the camera, which is great for all kind of photos. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/30446316381/in/dateposted/" title="Sony RX100 IV Ports open"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/6/5344/30446316381_0f082d6397_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Sony RX100 IV Ports open" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And then I own three extra batteries and a charger for them. I bought two original <a href="http://amzn.to/2eeYQy1">Sony NP-BX1/M8 Lithium-Ion X Type Batteries</a> and one <a href="http://amzn.to/2eJ8reG">Bundlestar battery</a> as the latter was half the price. The Bundlestar battery feels like it usually last a bit shorter than the original Sony ones, but I haven’t tested this in-depth to see it. The Bundlestar battery works just fine, so if you’re on a budget and need more power take it. The charger I bought is the <a href="http://amzn.to/2emViNX">Charger for Sony NP-BX1 Bundlestar Baxxtar</a> which seems to also be available under different names, usually costing around 16€ or double that with two batteries included. </p>

<h2 id="the-bottomline">The Bottomline</h2>

<p>The Sony RX100 IV is not cheap - at almost 1.000€ it is amongst the most expensive pocket cameras you can find and chances are that you don’t need this good a camera. If you’re, however, a passionate photographer &amp; outdoor enthusiast who likes to document his adventures and be able to possibly print large photos of them, then the Sony RX100 IV is worth considering. Also for professional photographers who want to go lighter or need a high-quality back-up camera the RX100 IV is worth a look, as it shots RAW and 4K Video.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29748741131/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Bodensee"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8007/29748741131_a681170dde_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Bodensee" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>With this cave-eat out of the way: This is the camera you want to document your adventures. When you’re heading out on a once-in-a-lifetime trip, like hiking a long trail, visit the Annapurna Basecamp or go ski-touring on Svalbard, then you want to have the Sony RX100 IV along to make photos of your adventure. Superb image quality with an impressive 16.0 FPS you can shot face-paced action like skiing, climbing and trailrunning, while the small size allows for shots from the hip for street photography. The EVF lets you operate the camera in the brightest sunlight without problems, and the colours and images this little ultralight camera produces are simply superb and often on-par with much larger &amp; more expensive DSLRs. Did I mention how light and small it is and that I usually carry it in my chest pocket? This is the ultralight backpacking &amp; climbing camera to rule them all. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is the camera you want to document your adventures. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>By the way: On my many trips with athletes which create images and videos for their own Social Media channels, the Sony RX100 IV (or an earlier version) is what they carry. I have friends who ski, climb, mountaineer and trailrun professionally, and like me they carry this wee camera along on their adventures, because they too consider it the best tool to create content for their Social media presences while not carrying too much weight.  </p>

<p><em>Sidenote: If you want a relative light weight camera with the absolute best possible image quality I would recommend getting a Full-Frame camera like the <a href="http://amzn.to/2eZqouN">Sony A7RII</a> with a <a href="http://amzn.to/2eZvk2z">great all-round lens</a>. It is just that that combo costs you upwards of 5.400€ and weighs at least 1.511 g, which is more than five times what the RX100 IV puts on the scales. And honestly, unless you’re going to print A1 prints or larger you likely won’t need the power the A7RII has.</em></p>

<p>Things have changed quite a bit in the time I have run this blog: When I started off with outdoor blogging people would usually not show themselves in their articles *¹ - at most a photo of oneself staring off into the distance. Maybe I was naive, young, or both, but back then I didn’t have a problem with showing myself (something that possibly has changed a bit in the last years as I have a family now and am more private). Nowadays, however, Selfies are an accepted form of portraying oneself, nowhere as ubiquitous as on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hendrikm/">Instagram</a>. </p>

<p>What is also ubiquitous on Instagram are these “<em>epic</em>” shots where a tiny person stars of into what looks like the wilderness. Here’s one of these: </p>

<blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-version="7" style=" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);"><div style="padding:8px;"> <div style=" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;"> <div style=" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;"></div></div><p style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BHAgSC6vhs9/" style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;" target="_blank">A photo posted by Hendrik Morkel (@hendrikm)</a> on <time style=" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;" datetime="2016-06-23T18:58:05+00:00">Jun 23, 2016 at 11:58am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote>

<p><br /> Personally I really am not a big fan of them, although I do see their appeal. My main problem is usually that it is always the same places that get these shots, and what is portrayed as epic wilderness or <em>“off-the-beaten-track”</em> are in truth places where you park your car 5 minutes away and then walk on a wide path to the spot. Add in a sunrise, sunset or a headlamp &amp; the Milky Way, do some Photoshop Magic and you have the standard Instagram photo which will attract thousands of likes. Why? Well, because people have seen that image, or a minor variation of it, already hundreds of times, and what is familiar is easy to like.
<br />
<br />But this article isn’t supposed to be on the failings of Instagram photography and my dislike of it, but the power of gear photos. It’s something I have been pondering over the last months, as I occasionally also post the tiny-person-in-big-environment-photo, and while they get a lot of engagement, it are the photos of gear - tents, backpacks, stoves, even a pair of shoes - that get even more engagement. It might be that my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hikinginfinland/">Facebook Fans</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hendrikmorkel">Twitter Followers</a> are just as big gear nerds as me, or it might be something else. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/9763145235/in/album-72157635543361552/" title="Mountain Laurel Designs TrailStar"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/4/3700/9763145235_51b887b518_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Mountain Laurel Designs TrailStar" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>That something else it is what I’d like to ponder about (because we all know that we are gear nerds ;). I think that these, lets call them in contrast to the <em>tiny-person-in-big-environment-photos</em>, great-gear-in-an-epic-environment-photos, are so popular, because a photo of a tent in a beautiful spot, the stove that’s just set up to prepare dinner or the shoes hiking on a trail allow the viewer to put oneself literally in those shoes, behind that stove and in that tent. Sure, one could imagine that that’s you who looks of into the distance high in the mountains, but somewhere inside you know you haven’t been there. But that piece of equipment there - you might own that tent or stove - allows the viewer to put him- or herself there. You can imagine how pretty it would be to lay in that tent and stare into the sunrise in the morning, or sit behind that stove, ready to put the water on so that dinner can be served in a wee bit. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14193489569/in/album-72157644166894052/" title="Dinner in the making"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5568/14193489569_090587cee9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="680" alt="Dinner in the making" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>At least that are my thoughts why these gear photos are more popular than photos of a friend skiing down a fine line, starring up that impressive mountain face or hiking on a cool path. That person shown there, the viewer knows, isn’t her, but in that tent there, that could be where he’d like to go to bed. And with that comes maybe also the idea that it’d be nice to own that pair of shoes, that pack, tent, quilt or stove - because one could use it right there, and have with some luck of the weather fairy, the same great experience than the photographer of that gear photo.</p>

<p>Weather. It can change - in a matter of minutes. Thus experienced on my last backpacking trip into the Tre Cime and Fanes-Sennes-Prags Nature Parks. What should have been a warm autumn hike in a great surrounding turned out to be an early winter/ autumn hike in an even prettier surrounding, just a tad colder as expected. Good thing we had enough warm clothes with us, some fine Whiskey from Scotland and plenty of good mood. This is just a teaser, a detailed trip report should follow in the next three weeks or so. Here’s a few photos to make you curious for the full article =) </p>

<p>Day one went from sunny and warm to white-out. Good thing we found an open winter room!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/30287291392/in/dateposted/" title="Descent through snowy switchbacks"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8127/30287291392_1bd6230774_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Descent through snowy switchbacks" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Day two was snow, snow, going down and rain. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/30317861721/in/dateposted/" title="La Sportiva TX2"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8550/30317861721_e7048769ff_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="La Sportiva TX2" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>On the third day we again had rain, snow and then some spectacular sunshine on the way up through an enchanted forest. Sublime.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/30287286992/in/dateposted/" title="Camp on the fourth morning"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/6/5680/30287286992_aeb90feb6a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Camp on the fourth morning" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>On the fourth day we visited the gorgeous Rossalm where I had some tasty Kaiserschmarrn before setting off into the cold hail &amp; snow again.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/30317858291/in/dateposted/" title="Dinner!"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8271/30317858291_7810df26a5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Dinner!" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Dinner was always something to look forward too, and that Curry Chicken from Real Turmat was so good, we could have eaten two (or three)! </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/30404195455/in/dateposted/" title="Where does the trail lead?"><img src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/6/5544/30404195455_b2ca9ae254_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Where does the trail lead?" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And as most trips, also this adventure needed to end some day. </p>

    <id>http://hikinginfinland.com/2016/09/arcteryx-workshop-tour</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Canada is not just home to some fantastic mountains, <a href="http://www.hevydevy.com">great music</a> and a <a href="https://twitter.com/JustinTrudeau">cool Prime Minister</a>, also Arc’teryx hails from the largest North American country. Last December I flew to Vancouver to cover the unveiling of the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/12/arcteryx-voltair-avalanche-airbag.html">Voltair Avalanche Airbag</a> and the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/12/arcteryx-procline-carbon-lite-ski-boot.html">Procline Carbon Lite Ski Boot</a>. While there my colleagues and me were also treated to a tour of the Arc’teryx design studio and the factory, where iconic Arc’teryx garments like the Alpha SV Jacket are made. </p>

<p>What goes into designing a jacket like the <a href="http://www.arcteryx.com/product.aspx?language=EN&amp;gender=Mens&amp;category=Shell_Jackets&amp;model=Alpha-SV-Jacket">Arc’teryx Alpha SV Jacket</a>? How is it made? Who makes it? Where is it made? After my visit to the Arc’teryx factory in North Vancouver - one of four factories Arc’teryx operates in Canada - these are questions I feel I have the answers to. If you’re a gear nerd like me then visiting a factory - an Arc’teryx factory! - is like entering the holy halls of outdoor gear making. There’s so much skill and knowledge going into making these garments which we take out to the mountains and forests on our adventures that it’s inspiring to see it happen in front of your eyes, ask questions and of course take photos. The good lad that I am, well-knowing fellow gear nerds would also love to read about a Arc’teryx factory visit, I am here sharing my visit in photos and words with you. After that you’ll see your Arc’teryx hardshell with new eyes, realizing what amount of work went into it!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29965146626/in/dateposted/" title="Material Reception"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/6/5819/29965146626_e30d910a38_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Material Reception" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29371597604/in/dateposted/" title="What keeps you dry?"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/6/5498/29371597604_93696ec186_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="What keeps you dry?" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Every garment that is made in North Vancouver starts at the receiving area. Rolls of Gore-Tex, Polartec and many more fine materials arrive here in dozens of colours, and if you’re a MYOG enthusiast this probably is heaven already for you. As the 300 employees at this factory are super-efficient, though, those rolls of fabric don’t stay long there. Soon they end up on one of the long cutting tables.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29371596414/in/dateposted/" title="Cutting tables"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8673/29371596414_3a1b8ccba7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Cutting tables" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>There many, many sheets of fabric are layered carefully on top of each other, with a final paper layer which has all the patterns printed on it. These are designed in the most-efficient way so that as little material is wasted as possible. Then the gentlemen above - who does this since many years, and yes, still has all his fingers! - takes a super-sharp cutter machine to cut them up into the pieces of fabric which later make up the garments. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29965146226/in/dateposted/" title="Arc&#x27;teryx Veilance"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8548/29965146226_b87fc94070_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Arc&#x27;teryx Veilance" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Speaking of garments, made in this factory are besides some iconic jackets like the Alpha SV Jacket which you’re likely most-familiar with also <a href="http://veilance.arcteryx.com/Home.aspx?language=EN">Arc’teryx Veilance</a> garments, those awesome blazers and raincoats which are made of the same high-quality materials as the outdoor garments but with tons more style. You could wear a Veilance Blazer to a meeting with Justin Trudeau and wouldn’t look out of place, so classy are these garments. But the alpine mountain nerd I am we concentrated on checking out how the Alpha SV is made (and yes, I’d love to own a Veilance coat &amp; go back to see how it is made!).</p>

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29916107531/in/dateposted/" title="Alpha SV in the making"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/6/5530/29916107531_224ede5bc7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Alpha SV in the making" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Making the jacket takes around 280 minutes over 197 work steps. The jacket travels over 30 workstations until it is labelled and ready, and has been worked on by 13 people. Arc’teryx inspires to make the fastest and best apparel factory plant, and where do you go to learn about efficient manufacturing? To Japan and Toyota with their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing">lean manufacturing</a> methodology. This resulted in the employees in Vancouver learning new skills so they can do more work steps in one go, which minimizes the travel &amp; waiting time between work steps. Now one worker can for example sew a seam, then tapes it and then applies some Arc’teryx magic to it (Sorry, I can’t say what that magic is as I signed an NDA!) and can pass it on to the next worker along the line, instead of three workers doing each step individually. </p>

<p>Speaking of the workers, they learn in a 12 week sewing training programme all the skills they need to work at the Arc’teryx factory - from sewing over taping and learning about the Lean programme. They have a 94% graduate rate of this programme, and the employees made a happy &amp; proud impression on me. Arc’teryx cares well for their employees, with regular breaks, being able to switch up stations, good pay - and many were also sporting Arc’teryx garments, some even garments which they sewed just for themselves! The trainees of the sewing programme also do good, as they make from excess material Ponchos for the homeless of Vancouver and give these away for free to those in need. </p>

<p>Back to the Alpha SV. There’s 48 jackets made per day in Vancouver, and each jacket is controlled during different stages of the manufacturing process. Some jackets get into the water pressure test to see if the material is good, and at the end the jacket gets its label and is ready to go on adventures with you. As you can imagine, it was inspiring to see this jacket being made - from the fabric over the cutting to the different steps, slowly the jacket started to take shape. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29371602664/in/dateposted/" title="Yarn"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8113/29371602664_363fe1b77c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Yarn" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>After our visit to the factory we went to the design studio. If you thought it couldn’t get better after a visit to the Arc’teryx factory - I was in awe about what I just saw! - you’re in for a treat. Because what gets made at the factory is imagined &amp; designed in the studio. Here you find a small factory floor itself, where Greg &amp; his colleagues can create a jacket (or one-offs for athletes! What we saw there was AMAZING!) in a few hours and then pass it on to one of their athletes for testing. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29965148436/in/dateposted/" title="Design Studio Bird&#x27;s Eye View"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8277/29965148436_f5822d1a91_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Design Studio Bird&#x27;s Eye View" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The designers are usually working on garments that comes out three years down the line, so right now they will be designing &amp; testing garments which hit the stores in Fall 2019. I imagine it gets quite hard to make sure you’re not spilling secrets at meetings and trade shows if you’re working so far in advance! </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29999090935/in/album-72157661450855749/" title="Designing"><img src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/6/5832/29999090935_5447f941ab_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Designing" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Finally we also got to take a peek into the Arc’teryx workshop, where they build machines and things they can not get anywhere else. They got all the fancy machines which you can imagine, and it is in part thanks to that workshop and the people there that Arc’teryx can come up with new innovations for manufacturing and in apparel technology. </p>

<p>After this fantastic tour of the factory, workshop and design studio we were treated to the brand-new, never-before seen <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/12/arcteryx-procline-carbon-lite-ski-boot.html">Procline Carbon Lite Ski Boot</a> and <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/12/arcteryx-voltair-avalanche-airbag.html">Voltair Avalanche Airbag</a> presentation, which we’d be testing a day later out in the backyard of Arc’teryx in British Columbia. But that’s a story for another day!</p>

<p>Even if you’re not able to go visit the Arc’teryx design studio - with the <a href="http://hiveclimbing.com/northshore/">Hive North Shore Climbing Gym</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Deep+Cove+Brewers+and+Distillers/@49.306442,-123.011479,19z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xb2f93ee1ea666c14!8m2!3d49.3063074!4d-123.0117136?hl=en-US">Deep Cove Brewers and Distillers</a> they have a great bouldering gym and craft beer brewery in the same building which means you sort of can visit Arc’teryx - and you might even run into Arc’teryx employees &amp; athletes there! </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29646888770/in/dateposted/" title="GoPro HERO4 Session"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8328/29646888770_5e14d97ac1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="GoPro HERO4 Session" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I met GoPro at the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/02/ispo-2016-news-iii.html">ISPO</a> earlier this year and had a nice chat with them, and when they asked if I’d be interested in testing their HERO4 Session I said yes. While my experience with the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2011/10/gopro-hd-hero2.html">GoPro Hero 2</a> was more like <em>Meh</em> and also the Garmin Virb was something I seldom would take along, I have had the HERO4 Session a lot outdoors in the last months. As a Photographer video is usually just a side-consideration for me, but as I am pondering videos more seriously it is nice to have a small, light and good video camera.</p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>As usually I put my <a href="http://shop.gopro.com/EMEA/cameras/hero-session/CHDHS-102-master.html">HERO4 Session</a> through a serious testing period to see how it performs in many different situations. The HERO4 Session arrived in February at Hiking in Finland HQ and has been along ski-touring in Norway, hiking, paddling and caving in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/07/multi-adventures-in-macedonia.html">Macedonia</a>, bouldering and sea kayaking on <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/08/cycling-and-bouldering-on-aland.html">Åland</a> and climbing, hiking and watching the sun set in Greece, and comes with me when I am going to South Tyrol next month and most likely also to Mexico in November. As the Session 5 was just announced last week I felt it is about time to review this wee camera cube (though GoPro wished I’d done it ages ago =). </p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>The GoPro HERO4 Session’s function is summed up pretty easily: Document your adventures, be they skiing in Lyngen, climbing in Greece, hiking in Finland or enjoying the beach with your family. It takes crisp 1080 HD Videos, makes pretty Timelapses and photos from your activities, and lets you easily share them. </p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>One Button Video Recording - and push it once more to stop recording and turn the camera off</li>
  <li>One Button Timelapse out of the box, easy to adjust via the camera or the GoPro app on your phone</li>
  <li>Wifi and Bluetooth allows you to control the Session via your tablet or smartphone</li>
  <li>Waterproof to 10 m without a housing</li>
  <li>Dozens and dozens of mounts to attach it to almost anything imaginable</li>
</ul>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28810989151/in/album-72157672041470976/" title="On the way back to Mariehamn from Kobba Klintar"><img src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8695/28810989151_e0db3046b1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="On the way back to Mariehamn from Kobba Klintar" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>The Session is one of the smallest action cameras on the market. It’s a tiny cube which is why I found it so useful to take along on my trips. The “Press one button and it records” feature is also great, gone the times of where you’re wearing a GoPro and first push it on and then hit the record button, often not sure if it actually is now recording or not. That same button you can push a wee bit longer and it records a Timelapse, and this I found pretty cool as video and timelapse with one push of a button is a great step forward in user friendliness. </p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>The camera itself is high-quality and bumps into the rock wall, dropping it into my pack and letting it go dive in the salty Baltic and fresh water lakes didn’t bother it at all. The front lens glass protector has been kept scratch-free during all this time, one just needs to be careful to not touch it with greasy fingers as that can get messy (but easy enough to clean). I believe this camera can survive several years of use and abuse without problems. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26634868293/in/album-72157666107618714/" title="Exit through the Gift Shop"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/8/7419/26634868293_442d643a1e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Exit through the Gift Shop" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>The Session weighs a mere 71 g. Add in a case (16 g) and a mount like an <a href="http://amzn.to/2dt32sU">adhesive mount</a> (11 g) or the <a href="http://amzn.to/2cZCP9C">Tripod/ Selfie Stick</a> (215 g) and it’s a bit more, but especially with the latter you can take pretty ace photos and videos of yourself in action or fold the legs out and take a time-lapse of the sunset, all for a combined weight of 303 g (That’s the 3-Way Arm, a cage for the camera and the Session itself).</p>

<h2 id="sustainability--recyclability">Sustainability &amp; Recyclability</h2>

<p>You can <a href="http://shop.gopro.com/EMEA/refurbished/">buy refurbished cameras from GoPro</a> directly, which is a cool move and puts less GoPros into the waste streams of the world. Also on their website they have a lengthy website dedicated to <a href="https://gopro.com/casupplychaindisclosure">social and environmental matters</a>, while <a href="https://gopro.com/goproforacause">GoPro Cause</a> lets you get involved or donate with social projects around the world.</p>

<p>How to get rid of an old GoPro, though? If you life in Europe you should be aware of the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/weee/index_en.htm">WEEE Directive</a> which means electronic waste does not belong into your normal household waste. It gives you ideas where you can get rid of your old camera (and other electronic garbage, like that TV, the old Playstation and the broken cellphone from 2003). </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29857913641/in/dateposted/" title="The tiny GoPro HERO4 Session likes the autumn"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5542/29857913641_e98d176270_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="The tiny GoPro HERO4 Session likes the autumn" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p>I have used the HERO4 Session more as I thought I would. Unlike some of my blogger friends (Hey there <a href="http://www.travelingjackie.com">Jackie</a>!) who often only use a GoPro and their smartphone my main tool is a <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/photography/">camera</a> as I earn money with my photography. Now while the Session does take photos they’re usually not something a magazine is looking for, hence I carry my <a href="http://amzn.to/2drNeXo">Sony RX 100 IV</a> wherever I go. But the HERO4 Session is so small, light and intuitive that it’s a great addition to a small camera, especially for activities like climbing, skiing and cycling where it’s nice to attach the camera to yourself or your equipment and film your adventure. </p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lI1uuFphJSU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>What I like most about the HERO4 Session - and I might repeat myself here - is that it is so easy to use. Push the button and it records - push again and it’s finished. Push the button 3 seconds and it starts to record a timelapse. Push again and it stops. Accessing the settings is easy on the device as the User Interface is really smartly designed, and you can change the camera angle (from wide to medium), timelapse settings - from 0,5 seconds to 60 seconds - and a bunch more, all via the two buttons on the camera</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29646889400/in/dateposted/" title="GoPro HERO4 Session SD Card and USB Door"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8010/29646889400_4f4f9edb42_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="GoPro HERO4 Session SD Card and USB Door" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>All you need to start is a <a href="http://amzn.to/2cFiX8B">MicroSDXC Card</a> and you’re ready to head out. The <a href="http://amzn.to/2cZCP9C">GoPro 3-Way Grip &amp; Tripod</a> aka a fancy Selfie Stick with tripod legs that hide away has been something that I was very sceptical of (who wouldn’t be sceptical of Selfie Sticks?) but after using it a couple of times and seeing what great footage one can shot with it I was a convert. Now my Session is usually connected to the 3-Way Grip, as it allows for cool angles on the go, a more stable flow when hiking (though I’d like a gimbal for it) and the Tripod legs make it great for filming a timelapse. </p>

<p>The camera is also really durable - bumps against the rock when climbing didn’t bother it, it dived in and out of salt and fresh water without problems, and also took the daily abuse of being carried in a sidepocket or backpack without problems.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29826592252/in/dateposted/" title="GoPro 3-Way Arm &amp; Tripod + legs"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8212/29826592252_1c7fa02698_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="GoPro 3-Way Arm &amp; Tripod + legs" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The battery life depends quite a bit on how you use the camera, the temperature, and also if you have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth turned on or off (off means longer battery life but then you can’t control it with your phone). I had the HERO4 Session along in Macedonia and Greece and got a solid two weeks of use out of the camera, and if my memory doesn’t betray me I only once topped it shortly up in the middle of the trip. I take short clips - anything between 10 seconds and 3 minutes, as well as timelpases. Overall I got some 5 timelapses and around 60 clips shot during those two weeks, almost on a single charge (topped up once!). As the HERO€ Session can be charged via USB it is easy to charge it on the trail with a power bank, too. GoPro themselves also answers the <a href="https://gopro.com/support/articles/hero4-session-battery-life">battery life question</a> in detail.</p>

<p>What I found really great is that you can connect the Session to your smartphone, grab a photo or video, edit it on your phone and share it on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hendrikm/">Instagram</a>. Put the camera down and control the Session from your phone - hit record, adjust settings, whatever. It is so easy, you’ll love this feature if you use Social Media and previously just sat on a ton of footage but never did anything with it. There’s even the possibility to <em>find your GoPro</em> in case you’ve lost it under a bunch of papers! </p>

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29646896530/in/dateposted/" title="Viewing the Media on the GoPro HERO4 Session"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8448/29646896530_bb2fbfe0a6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Viewing the Media on the GoPro HERO4 Session" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Speaking of editing, GoPro has its own <a href="https://shop.gopro.com/EMEA/softwareandapp/">Apps</a> - for free! - which help you make a movie out of that footage. On the phone and desktop you even can let the App do all the work and you just sit back and see what it comes up with! </p>

<p>As for the footage coming out of it, I found it very nice indeed - for online publication. The photos (see the kayaking photo above) are of good quality for blogs and Social Media and probably could be used in a pinch in a magazine. The videos in 1080 HD are crisp with nice colours &amp; good sound, and the file size is wonderfully small in comparison what my other cameras throw out (as I already own four <a href="http://amzn.to/2dm7Z6l">HD External Hard Drives</a> storage is always a concern!). The HERO4 Session is a big step forward from my older action cameras, as adjusting from dark to bright is now quick &amp; good, and it even works great when <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hikinginfinland/videos/1193176694045994/">spelunking in dark caves with bats</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, while I got the HERO4 Session for free without obligations you can find the action camera for as little as 200€ (GoPro themselves ask for <a href="http://shop.gopro.com/EMEA/cameras/hero-session/CHDHS-102-master.html">230€ on their webstore</a>). That’s a pretty good price for such a well-designed camera, although there are action cameras out there which cost just half or less of that. If you’d like to support a company which in those cases rips off GoPro is up to you, I wouldn’t. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29314382373/in/dateposted/" title="GoPro HERO4 Session and lots of mounts"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8535/29314382373_91792ceef4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="GoPro HERO4 Session and lots of mounts" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="could-be-better">Could be better</h2>

<p>It is hard to pin-point things that I think could be better with the HERO4 Session, but as the HERO5 Session  was just launched I’d say GoPro addressed at least some of my concerns: Better video quality (now with 4K!) and Image stabilization. It now also has 10 Megapixel Photos but remains just as simple &amp; easy to use out of the box as the HERO4 Session I review here. But these were just tiny complaints from my side and I have been more than happy with the HERO4 Session.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29857687411/in/dateposted/" title="GoPro HERO4 Session - On"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8031/29857687411_3ea4033c53_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="GoPro HERO4 Session - On" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="competing-products">Competing Products</h2>

<p>There’s a range of Action Cameras which try to grab some of GoPros market share, most notably Garmin with the VIRB and Sony with its action cameras. Also DJI has tried to enter the market with the <a href="http://amzn.to/2d3fCkD">Osmo</a>, though it serves a slightly different niche. And then there’s the low-cost but still impressive action cameras which cost even less than the Session - I linked to some of these in recent <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/the-week-in-review/">The Week In Reviews</a> so browse them to read about these.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29826592702/in/dateposted/" title="GoPro HERO4 Session Outdoors"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7559/29826592702_395ccb285d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="GoPro HERO4 Session Outdoors" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>In the end the question you should ask yourself is: Do I need a one-click action camera? Are you out enough hiking, climbing, skiing, swimming, paddling, mountaineering, surfing &amp; cycling and wishing you had a small video camera along which films you &amp; your adventurous activities? Do you have the time afterwards to edit your footage and share it with your friends (or will you <a href="https://shop.gopro.com/EMEA/softwareandapp/">use the GoPro Quick Desktop or smartphone app</a> to do so)? Are you ready to drop around 300€ on the HERO4 Session, a MicroSDXC Card and some mounts?</p>

<p>If the answer is yes to all of these questions then I think you will find the GoPro Session a great little action camera. While I was sceptical if I’d use the Session at all - after all I hadn’t used the previous two action cameras I own in many years - it quickly has become something I take along on assignments &amp; when I head out for fun. Because it is so easy to use I am way more likely to actually take it out of my pack and push that button - knowing it will record crisp, cool videos of my friends &amp; me doing what we like most - being outside and having fun! Add in that it does so in an almost unobtrusive way, and that viewing, editing and sharing the footage I have recorded has never been easier and you have a winning package that fits in the palm of your hand.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-buy-it">Where to buy it</h2>

<p>As the Session 5 will come out in a few weeks the HERO4 Session - the one reviewed here - is available for good discounts already. <a href="http://bit.ly/2d9nrnr">REI</a> has a great package and you also find it at <a href="http://amzn.to/2cDx7aA">Amazon.com</a>, <a href="http://amzn.to/2d1EmYT">Amazon.co.uk</a> and <a href="http://amzn.to/2du8aA6">Amazon.de</a> for a good price. </p>

<h2 id="a-panorama-hike-in-the-brandnertal">A Panorama Hike in the Brandnertal</h2>

<p>Where did I leave off? Ah yeah, that I just came back to our apartment after my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/09/family-adventures-in-vorarlberg.html">Sunrise hike up the Kanisfluh</a>, ready for a day full of family adventures. With such a good weather forecast - the first really sunny day during our stay - we decided to head to the neighbouring Brandnertal¹ and hike on the family-friendly <a href="https://www.vorarlberg-alpenregion.at/brandnertal/bergbahnen/angebot-am-berg/naturspruengeweg/">Natursprünge-Weg Brandnertal</a>. After a drive of a bit over an hour we arrived in Studa and took the Dorfbahn up the mountain. There we switched into the Panoramabahn which brought us over to the start of the nature experience trail, which has been created in cooperation with the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/09/family-adventures-in-vorarlberg.html">inatura museum</a>. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29538786880/in/dateposted/" title="Up with the cable car"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7569/29538786880_53f3da0611_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Up with the cable car" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>But first it was already again lunch time, and so we sat down at <a href="http://www.frööd.at">Frööd</a> and ate to strengthen us for the stroll through the mountains. The food was tasty, as were their home-made lemonades, and the playground keeps kids active for a long time! Add in great views and you might just be inclined to sit on the terrace and sip cold drinks!</p>

<p>But we weren’t there to sit out a sunny day on a terrace and so we soon started to hike on the interactive Natursprünge Weg. In regular distances you find information stations which explain a certain topic - from the views over geology to respect for nature, it’s a wide array of topics which you can find out about. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29748736891/in/dateposted/" title="Natursprünge-Weg Brandnertal"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8033/29748736891_dcb20ae59d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Natursprünge-Weg Brandnertal" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>It was a wide, hard path which was OK to walk - the views were spectacular, though on a sunny day the lack of shadow could be causing trouble when on the trail with little kids, so always bring enough water, a longsleeved shirt and pants and a sun hat to protect the little hikers. Also the relative long distance (it’s around 90 minutes walking time with kids, so maybe close to 6 km) could be a problem, as there’s no shortcut. However, you can loan a handcart from the second station which would allow you to pull your kids down the trail, making it easier!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29748739211/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Eagle"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8547/29748739211_5daac6f772_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Eagle" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29748740181/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Barefoot trail at the end of the Natursprünge-Weg Brandnertal"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/8/7523/29748740181_ab82290f79_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Barefoot trail at the end of the Natursprünge-Weg Brandnertal" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>At the end we passed another Restaurant and the start of a Barefoot Trail which looked pretty nice, but we just went straight for the cable car as our little one was getting pretty tired and needed to get into bed soon! All in all the Natursprünge Trail was a good experience, but we did like the Panorama Trail in Bezau (read about it underneath) more as it was a lot prettier. </p>

<h2 id="a-barefoot-hike-in-bizau">A Barefoot Hike in Bizau</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.bizau-bregenzerwald.com/sommer/sport-freizeit/wandern/barfussweg/">Barfußweg Bizauer Moos</a> is a great little hike for friends of barefoot walking! It was also very close to our <a href="http://www.appartements-wuestner.at">apartment in Mellau</a> - a short bus ride from Mellau to Bizau and we could start! We followed the trail markers over narrow paths and wider streets to the start of the barefoot trail, which runs all the time along the short (or through) the little Ulve creek which finds its way through the highmoor. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29538800070/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Kanisfluh"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8208/29538800070_9ceeae31bd_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Kanisfluh" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Once we reached it we told our four year old son that we will now continue without shoes. He was highly sceptical and needed some serious convincing, but after he saw that mom and dad were walking through the muddy puddles he was all in favour of barefoot hiking! The barefoot trail runs mostly on grassy trails, with a few crossings of the ice-cold creek.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/27688676552/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Ice-cold on the Barefoot Trail in Bizau"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7188/27688676552_38b75b524b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Ice-cold on the Barefoot Trail in Bizau" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29718474512/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Barefoot!"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8179/29718474512_816cdfccf3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Barefoot!" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Our son really liked the ice-cold crossings, and loved it even more if he could make dad cross the creek twice =) The highmoor is beautiful, with colourful wildflowers all around and great views on the surrounding mountains. </p>

<p>At the end the trail runs in tight curves there and back, but always along the little creek, sometimes now also on duckboards (which can be very slippery with wet, muddy feet!) but mostly on grassy trails. Once you see the yellow-green bench you know that you’ve made it to the end of the trail! Now it’s time to wash your feet a final time in the cold creek - hopefully you brought a towel! - and get back into your shoes (unless you’re a monkey like me and have your <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/luna-sandals-oso.html">Luna Sandals</a> along!) and continue - for example towards <a href="http://www.jagdgasthaus-egender.at">Jagdgasthaus Egender</a> in Schönenbach, where you can taste the best Kässpätzle of the whole region!</p>

<h2 id="hiking-on-the-panaoramaweg-bezau">Hiking on the Panaoramaweg Bezau</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://touren.vorarlberg.travel/de/tour/wanderung/bezau-panoramaweg-baumgarten/2952601/">Panaoramaweg Bezau</a> was our absolute highlight of the trip to the Bregenzerwald in Vorarlberg. It was again very close to where we stayed in Mellau - a mere 10 minute Bus ride! - and the scenery, the lovely little path, the great Restaurant and the amazing views really made this hike stand out. </p>

<p>It started with a cable car ride up into the clouds for us four, and we took the pram along - which we then left at the Restaurant as the trail didn’t accommodate a pram (it was very washed out and there were some gates where you would have to lift it over it). We had a quick lunch - tasty soups and bread - while the clouds were racing around us. As the weather cleared up we made our first start at hiking the Panorama Trail. </p>

<p>But then the clouds and rain came back, and so we turned around to sit it out. Good thing the restaurant has a very nice playing corner where the kids could entertain themselves =)</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29205364873/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Playground"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8348/29205364873_a68dd68e37_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Playground" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Then the weather cleared up again and we made our second try. With rain jackets on we left the Restaurant and hiked up the narrow, washed-out trail while a little creek was flowing down. Blue sky started to gain the upper hand and the grey rain clouds moved on to other places. </p>

<p>The views on the trail are simply outstanding: Even on this cloudy day you could see the Alps in Switzerland, the commanding Kanisfluh which is the landmark peak of the Bregenzerwald, to the north over the low, lovely foothills of the Alps, the Allgäu and Lake Constance, and then to imposing mountains to the south. 
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29748743091/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Bodensee views"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8491/29748743091_0b35ede8a9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Bodensee views" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The trail was great for kids, always interesting - from Paragliders that were taking off to sheep - and kept our son in high spirits throughout the hike. </p>

<p>We had a look into the pretty Alpe Niedere chapel which was relatively new before we made the climb back towards the Restaurant and the cable car station. After an ice cream and Germknödel walked over to the cable car station and made the last cable car back to Bezau. This is a great and easy afternoon or morning out for a family with kids, even in moody weather. We felt it had all you need for a family hike: Easy access, good food for kids, a spacious changing room, an interesting trail which isn’t too long and stunning scenery. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29617903071/in/dateposted/" title="Stamps &amp; Postcards"><img src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/8/7784/29617903071_97697360f1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Stamps &amp; Postcards" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I just was at the post to drop a parcel, and what do my eyes espy? Outdoor-themed stamps! I had to pick up a package of each and share these with you! I love getting hand-written postcards from friends, and even more if there’s a nice stamp on the card. You thus can imagine I was pretty happy to see out of three new stamp sets which were just released that two had a theme that encouraged people to go outdoors! </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29617901821/in/dateposted/" title="Everyman&#x27;s Right Stamps"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8159/29617901821_cbe5a4cd30_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Everyman&#x27;s Right Stamps" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29617901121/in/dateposted/" title="Everyman&#x27;s Right Stamps inside"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8008/29617901121_82367a2f27_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Everyman&#x27;s Right Stamps inside" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Everyman’s Right Set includes six Class 1 stamps with topics like picking berries, camping in a tent in nature, ice fishing and cross country skiing. There’s a stamp for each season in this set, and I find these great because they help remind Finns about there basic human right, the Everyman’s Right - and maybe indirectly encourages them to get out into nature (because, you remember, <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/09/get-out-into-nature-because-itsgreatoutthere.html">#ItsGreatOutThere</a>!). I can picture some office worker getting a letter in winter with the XC skiing or ice fishing stamp on it, and how he lightens up because he remembers how good it felt to do these activities outside. Then after work this person would head home, switch into his outdoor clothes and grab the skis or ice fishing rod and head outdoors! I really hope this happens =)</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29587539992/in/dateposted/" title="Mushroom Stamps"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7581/29587539992_000962500d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Mushroom Stamps" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Autumn on the other hand is mushroom season and the theme of the other set. Gathering mushrooms is another very great reason to go into the forest and spend some quality time in the fresh air. My family and me, we love to go outside and hunt for mushrooms - and coming home &amp; being able to eat what you just gathered is just a great way to finish the day. We absolutely love the Horn of Plenty (commonly also called the Black Trumpet mushroom) and can highly recommend trying them if you have the chance. They’re also usually growing again in the same spots every year in our experience, so once you have found a good spot - remember it! Again I can envision how someone would get a letter with one of these mushroom-themed stamps and is encouraged to grab a basket, mushroom knife and guide book and heads into the woods to gather some tasty mushrooms! </p>

<h2 id="a-ride-with-the-wlderbhnle">A Ride with the Wälderbähnle</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://waelderbaehnle.at">Wälderbähnle</a> is what puts big smiles on kids’ faces - and adults if they’re trainspotters! My son is a big, big railroad fan and the possibility to ride on a train in great mountain scenery was a highlight for him. From the moment he woke up until we finally went to the railway station he was asking about it, and then it finally was time to climb aboard our carriage and enjoy the journey. </p>

<p>The Wälderbähnle offers two different rides: One with an old Diesel engine which runs most often and the more rare Steam Engine which pulls the eight or so carriages - including a Café! - from Bezau to Schwarzenberg through the beautiful mountains of the Bregenzerwald. We were pulled by the red Diesel engine and took a look at the Steam engine in the halls of the railway station of Bezau as we were back. It’s a short ride - the from Bezau to Schwarzenberg and back takes a bit over an hour, this includes the engine switching from one side to the other one when it goes back. All along the way you could see the mountains, crossed the Bregenzer Ache river and passed cows which were enjoying the fresh grass on the meadows along the tracks. </p>

<p>The ride was very popular with families and our carriage had at least a dozen kids between 0 and 12 in it - and as Kids under six are free of charge it’s not expensive either. You buy your ticket at the railway station in Bezau before you jump on the train, although you can <a href="http://waelderbaehnle.at/fahrplanbetrieb-preise-2016">reserve a ticket online</a> too, which is probably recommended for the days when the steam engine pulls the train.</p>

<h2 id="hiking-around-mellau">Hiking around Mellau</h2>

<p>We stayed with the Family Wüstner in Mellau, at one of their <a href="http://appartements-wuestner.at">Apartments</a> which were great for a family of four. Mellau is a small village which has everything we needed: A Supermarket for grocery shopping, very frequent bus connections to any place in the region, a cable car up the mountain, bike rentals and outdoor shops, plenty of Cafés &amp; restaurants and last, but certainly not least: A big hiking trail network. Right in front of our house started the Flusswege Path which runs along the Bregenzer Ache and explains on pretty info boards about the flora &amp; fauna of the river. At the end of the path you also can make a short stroll over to the impressive waterfall and then head back to Mellau, where one of the nice Cafés is waiting to help you with a good serving of coffee &amp; strudel =)</p>

<p>I also stole away for an evening hike up towards the Gopfberg, and again the trail started pretty much in front of our house. It was a nice walk up into the dusk and once I reached the start of the forest after all the meadows I was tempted to make a run for the summit and back, but without a headlamp on me I decided it’s smarter to simply stroll back down and watch the night fall over the small village. There is, however, the possibility to walk around the Gopfberg, something I want to do on my next trip there!</p>

<h2 id="a-visit-to-metzler-naturhautnah">A Visit to Metzler Naturhautnah</h2>

<p>When it rained just too much for a hiking trip we went and visited <a href="https://www.molkeprodukte.com">Metzler Naturhautnah</a>, a dairy farm with 100 goats and 20 cows which also produces cosmetics from the whey. We got a guided tour of the dairy and saw how tasty cheese was made, petted the goats in their adventure playground stable and then also tasted the delicious cheeses. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29026415093/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Goats!"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8285/29026415093_0f2bfec54b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Goats!" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>From the bus stop in Egg it is a short walk up to the farm of Family Metzler. It lays scenically up a hill with a great view of the mountains, and the buildings themselves are also aesthetically very pleasing to look at, the big stables being constructed from wood in a modern design. The tour started at the shop where the daughter in law welcomed us and showed us around, answering all our questions about cheese making, goats and cosmetic products. ly stopped, too, and so we walked through the wet and cloudy hills down to catch our bus back to Mellau =)</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29026415553/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Metzler Hautnah products"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8328/29026415553_5a469b1f7a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Metzler Hautnah products" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We then continued to the stable where we spent some quality time with the lovely goats, petting them and looking how they “played” around. This was great for our son, as nowadays it isn’t so often that you can get up close and friendly with a goat and other animals. Hungry we continued to the pretty Conference room slash Café where we had a super-tasty cheese lunch, with almost a dozen different cheeses and fresh bread. Once it was time to leave the rain happi</p>

<h2 id="inatura-museum">Inatura Museum</h2>

<p>The next morning it was again raining hard. Happily we had another rainy-day alternative on our list: A visit to the <a href="http://www.inatura.at/home/">inatura Erlebnis Naturschau Museum</a>. Situated in Dornbirn¹ it was an hour bus ride from Mellau to get there, but with the great local bus system it meant we jumped on just one bus and get out in Dornbirn an hour later!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29569577291/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Innatura Museum"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8088/29569577291_dd889afc82_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Innatura Museum" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Located in an old factory the museum is from the outside and inside a real pearl and such a great place to visit that we really enjoyed our time in it. From the temporary exhibition about beavers to the five permanent exhibitions, the inatura is a museum which wets the appetite of old &amp; young for knowledge and which encourages its visitors to touch and try things; especially in the Sciences Zones which one finds throughout the buildings you can see how magnetism works, play with cog wheels and see lots of fish swim happily in big tanks. Add in a nice Café, friendly &amp; helpful staff and you have a great destination to spend a rainy day and keep the kids happy! </p>

<h2 id="sunrise-hike-up-the-kanisfluh">Sunrise hike up the Kanisfluh</h2>

<p>Wednesday: Rain.
<br />Thursday: Rain. 
<br />Friday: Sunshine. </p>

<p>I guess that means I will get up at 2:30 am so I can watch the sun rise from the summit of the Kanisfluh, the landmark of the Bregenzerwald. I have seen the impressive mountain every day from Mellau &amp; our adventures there, and was eager to pay the summit a visit to enjoy the vast views from the summit. Combining it with the best light of the day was a no-brainer, and so I sneaked out of the apartment while the family continued to sleep. In the middle of the night I met mountain guide Matthias and my fellow sunrise hikers at the Tourist Office in Mellau; then we squeezed into Matthias’ car to ride to the other side of the mountain where our hike would start. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29026430193/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Darkness over the valley"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8601/29026430193_e732258f49_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Darkness over the valley" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The stars were still out when we set off from the car, but it wasn’t long until that magic light of pre-dawn started to arrive and colour the sky into the prettiest pastel colours. </p>

<p>We reached the summit cross a mere 45 minutes after we started hiking and weren’t the only ones up there who were waiting for the sun to rise. A group of friends  which set off way before us was shivering at the cross, waiting for the warm rays of the sun to warm them up. I slipped into my puffy jacket, took my camera and looked for the best angles.</p>

<p>And then the sun came. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/29024563664/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Sunrise"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7554/29024563664_3e538de954_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Sunrise" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We watched fascinated as the sun rose slowly over the horizon, and pastel colours slowly gave way to oranges and yellows, but before long the light of day was around us. Matthias shared a zip from his flask, and then it was time to start the descent.</p>

<p>While it would have been tempting to eat breakfast on the mountain hut close to our car I promised my family to be back for breakfast, and low &amp; behold: As I arrived back at the apartment with fresh, warm rolls from the supermarket the kids were just getting up. Over breakfast we were pondering what we should do on this beautiful, sunny day together!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Its Great Out There</em> has been my thinking since I started to regularly go outdoors and climb, hike, packraft, cycle or camp. Why I thinks that way you find out in this post!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/27700551721/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Sunrise on the Kanisfluh"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7180/27700551721_12abb83624_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Sunrise on the Kanisfluh" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>In last years #MyWeek #BeActive Challenge you got a <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/08/take-part-in-the-myweek-beactive-challenge.html">permit to get outdoors</a>, and following up on that initiative this year the European Outdoor Group wants you to realize once more that <a href="http://www.itsgreatoutthere.com">#ItsGreatOutThere</a>. If you <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hendrikm/">follow me on Instagram</a> you probably have seen that hashtag quite a bit, because I honestly prefer being outside instead of standing in front of my desk. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26965430150/in/album-72157666107618714/" title="Paddling at Matka Canyon 01"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7138/26965430150_1868afd7c2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Paddling at Matka Canyon 01" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The #ItsGreatOutThere campaign’s believe - which I fully support - is that outdoor activites have an positive impact on individuals and society as a whole. Fitness, self-confidence, life skills, fun, health, unforgettable memories &amp; a sustainable connection with nature – that is the power of outdoor sports. Add in friends &amp; your family and you will create lasting memories &amp; bonds which you will fondly look back to in old age! I much prefer to spend my time in nature with the family &amp; friends instead of being in a busy city or working at the office. When the latter gets too much I jump on my bike and head out for a ride, coming back feeling much more satisfied and happy.</p>

<p>To help you realize that its better outside (just in case you have forgeotten ;) the European Outdoor Group has partnered with a lot of cool events &amp; companies to offer you some great prizes in their competitions this autumn. First off is the <a href="http://www.itsgreatoutthere.com/competition01-timeout/">timeout</a> competition where you can win two tickets for the The North Face Mountain Festival as well as some cool outdoor kit which makes autumn adventures warmer &amp; drier. Click that link if you feel like chilling with like-minded folks in Switzerland in the middle of September!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/23380978901/in/album-72157659581645884/" title="Hello Beach!"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/1/720/23380978901_4d30838bf6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Hello Beach!" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>But even if you don’t have the desire to go to Switzerland for hiking, camping, climbing and good campfire vibes, you always can use the #ItsGreatOutThere and #beactive hashtags when you’re outside. Be it your cycle commute to the office, an after-work run in the forest, a packrafting Microadventure at the weekend or going for a dayhike with the kids. Need some ideas how you can #BeActive? Here you go:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Explore a Nature trail near where you life</li>
  <li>Go geocaching</li>
  <li>Build a den in the forest with your kids</li>
  <li>Go bouldering</li>
</ul>

<p>And after that, share your outdoor fun with your friends &amp; followers on Social Media. Don’t forget to add the #ItsGreatOutThere and #BeActive hashtags - That’s it =) You now have a great permission to get outdoors and a superb excuse, too - in case you need one! Have fun and feel free to share your adventures with us in the comments underneath!</p>
