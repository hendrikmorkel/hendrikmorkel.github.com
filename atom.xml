<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>The <a href="http://rojksuperwear.com/en/chicks/chicks-primaloft-bomberpile-tamarillo.html">Primaloft Bomber Pile</a> jacket from <a href="http://rojksuperwear.com/en/">Röjk</a> is the kind of Midlayer that looks great on the way to the office and shows its functionality when you’re hitting the slopes. Made in Europe from the unique PrimaLoft Polyester this piece is so fluffy and warm that cold temperatures won’t stop you from enjoying your favourite winter sports, while wicking away sweat to keep you feelin’ dry &amp; toasty. The fluffy outside makes you look a wee bit like Chewbacca, which never is a bad thing, and thumbloops as well as smartly placed pockets keep drafts out and important items close by. A functional piece that’s great under your hardshell when you go down pillows of Pow and &amp; stylish if you enjoy a hot cup of Minttukakao afterwards.</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>have you heard of the packrafter’s nightmare? It’s carrying a PFD on long trips. Because traditional foam PFDs are very bulky they’re not nice to carry, and sitting in a packraft with them isn’t the most comfortable thing either. Enter the <a href="http://www.packrafting-store.de/Safety/Anfibio-Buoy-Boy::499.html?language=en">Anfibio Buoy Boy</a>, an inflatable vest that gives you buoyancy when you’re packrafting on lakes and rivers, and while you’re backpacking it packs to the sizes of a 1 l bottle and weighs a mere 310 g! Developed by the passionate packrafters of the <a href="http://www.packrafting-store.de/index.php?XTCsid=udhrlcr9ija6n1oj3jfmvplou2">Packrafting Store</a> and part of their <a href="http://www.packrafting-store.de/Extras:::19.html">Anfibio line</a> of packrafting accessories, the Buoy Boy is a great way to add safety to your white water and lake adventures off the beaten track, with all the smart details a packrafter wants!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>Eating outdoors: Some prefer plastic bags, other titanium pots, but those who want to eat in style take their <a href="http://www.kupilka.fi/en/products/kupilka-premium">Kupilka Premium Set</a> along. Proper cutlery lets one eat sophisticated with knife, fork and spoon, as well as an dessert spoon for the pudding. A Kupilka 44 plate is great for fish and salad, while the Kupilka 55 bowl is the right choice for soups and stews. One doesn’t need to be thirsty, either: The Kupilka 21 makes a great cup for red wine, coffee and water alike, and for stronger liquids the Kupilka 5 is the right choice. Best of all: After one is done eating &amp; drinking one can rinse the <a href="http://www.kupilka.fi/en/">Kupilka</a> products easily to get them clean - or if you’re in your cottage you can even put them in the dishwasher! A great choice for those who like to cook and feast at home &amp; on the trail - and those tired eating from plastic bags!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>It is not just always backpacking á la backpacking in the forests and hills. Sometimes it is also backpacking á la backpacking from city to town to village, travelling on busses, trains and richa taxis. And for that a durable pack like the <a href="https://www.hanchor.com/products/Travel%20Series/Breccia_Travel_Backpack?locale=en">Breccia Travel Backpack</a> from <a href="https://www.hanchor.com/">HANCHOR</a> is an ideal choice. It has a carry-on size which makes it excellent for an ultralight approach to travelling, and the durable &amp; waterproof construction makes it suitable for backpacking in Central America during the rain season and scrambling in Utah’s canyons in the summer. It can be expanded with modular pockets for any occasion - from a short business city travel trip to a long backpacking tour around the world. It also works great for hiking, carrying climbing gear to the crag or carry photo equipment to the next shoot - a true multi-use beast that is ideal for the ultralight traveller.</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>staying warm in winter - it’s something we Northern people know about. Hailing from Canada <a href="http://arcteryx.com/">Arc’teryx</a> belongs to the illustrious circle of companies which know how to keep alpinists, skiers and backpackers warm when the temperatures drop below 0°C. Their <a href="http://arcteryx.com/product.aspx?language=EN&amp;gender=mens&amp;model=Atom-LT-Hoody">Atom LT Hoody</a> is not just one of their most popular midlayer insulation pieces which is great when cold wind howls through the mountains &amp; tundra, it also works well on its own when it is not freezing cold. Coreloft™ insulation in the torso, arms and hood keep one toasty, and the side panels of Polartec® Power Stretch® with Hardface® Technology add breathability and stretchiness. And when the sun comes out, it packs small and light in the pack - excellent for a winter day out in the hills!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>watching the sun rise in the mountains - is there anything better? Not really. With the new <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=13582&amp;pw=73183&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hyperlitemountaingear.com%2Ffeatured-ultralight-packs%2Fdaybreak-pack.html">Daybreak Pack</a> from <a href="http://bit.ly/1QQRFL2">Hyperlite Mountain Gear</a> I always have all I need along for a day in the hills. It has side pockets for my water bottles, the possibility to attach an ice axe and a back pocket with additional bungees to easily access rain gear or a puffy jacket. Made from Dyneema® Cuben Fiber it takes the abuse of scrambling in the mountains and bushwhacking through the forests, and at 539 g it is so light you can carry it all day long. And if you consider that it’s made in Maine, USA, you know it is a quality piece of gear that is gonna last many, many years!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>with snow on the ground there is no reason to hike or cycle - snow means it is time to ski. And the <a href="http://skinbased.com/5/">WAP 127</a> from <a href="http://www.oacsport.fi">OAC</a> is the perfect tool to ski - from home to the cabin, up the hills and down the slopes. Best thing: I don’t even need to get expensive ski boots, as I can use my normal winter boots thanks to the <a href="http://skinbased.com/10/">OAC EA Binding</a> where I can step in with my winter boots or trailrunners alike and go to the fjells. The patented Unicoat base structure of the WAP 127 allows me to climb steep hills and have great grip on any snow. And at just 1.050 g they’re lighter than many snowshoes - and a lot faster and more fun, too! With these winter will be a lot of fun, so please bring me a pair! </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="http://skinbased.com/5/" title="OAC WAP 127"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/619/23345928911_d49f8d737f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="OAC WAP 127" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>While I’m Opting to be Outside, sometimes litte things are needed to make them more comfortable. Be that a stove to brew a hot cup of tea or a warm beanie, small things make being outside more fun and pleasurable. The focus, however, is always on being outside, and not the gear. Sure you need it, but it’s not the reason to go out. That is to relax, be inspired, spend times with family &amp; good friends and enjoying the beautiful nature. </p>

<p>With that said, some warm down gear does help to make cold winter hikes more fun. Damn, even sitting in a wooden hut is made better with some down around your feet. The <a href="https://goosefeetgear.com/products/1-down-socks">Down Socks</a> from Goose Feet Gear not only ensure that toes are toasty, they make it possible to dry my trailrunners by the fire so they’re ready for next days hike. And if you have cold feet in your quilt - these Down Socks ensure you wake up with warm feet!</p>

<p>Also <a href="https://www.blackrockgear.com/product/test/">The Original Black Rock Gear Down Beanie</a> is filled with 950 cuin Hungarian Down and ensures a warm head when the wind is blowing in sub-zero temperatures. Hiking with cold ears is so last year, thus a Black Rock Hat is not only keeping the ears warm but also is <em>trés chic</em>! Did I mention it is ultralight? Of course it is!</p>

<p>Feet and head being cared for, that leaves the hands as the third extremities which tend to not like to much snow, wind and cold. And it just so happens that the <a href="http://www.mountainlaureldesigns.com/shop/product_info.php?cPath=37&amp;products_id=51">Mountain Laurel Designs eVent Mitts</a> are not just excellent to keep the rain of my hands, they also work great in winter! Cold wind and snow won’t trouble you anymore with these ultralight gloves on your hands.</p>

<p>When you do take the gloves off, it often is to boil water for a hot cup of tea. The <a href="https://www.traildesigns.com/stoves/caldera-sidewinder-solo">Caldera Sidewinder Solo</a> is not just a very great stove system, with the 1,1 litre pot you can even boil water for your mates so that everyone has a warm cup of tea! It all packs compactly into the pot and is fuel-efficient, thus a great choice for ultralight outdoor enthusiasts.</p>

<p>That leaves a warm coat for those cold temperatures. Or a toasty pair of trousers. Long underwear. Warm winter shoes. Well, sometimes you’re missing one piece of gear, and that’s where the 50€ Gift Card from <a href="https://www.bergzeit.co.uk/?pid=81/">Bergzeit.co.uk</a> comes in very useful. With it you can save a nice amount of cash on your next big purchase - be that a Merino Baselayer or your new AT skis, Bergzeit.co.uk has it all. </p>

<p>Welcome again to a new Hiking in Finland Advent Calendar! Like in the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/advent-calendar-2013/">years</a> <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/advent-calendar-2014/">before</a>, a good set of rules makes running this a lot easier for everyone involved. Read them carefully and everything will be clear, and check out the <strong>tips</strong> at the end!. </p>

<p>This years calendar will run 25 days (= 25 Doors), and behind each door you will find a fine piece of brand-new gear which should make your next outdoor adventure fun and ultralight. Some information on the prizes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All prizes are sent directly from the company providing them. </li>
  <li>Sometimes it is possible that you can choose size, colour and other variables. Where this is the case, it will be mentioned in the text of the Door.</li>
  <li>This means garments can be either female or male, backpacks can be different torso sizes and meals can be vegetarian or with meat. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-rules">The Rules</h2>

<p>To win something you should check in each day here and enter the raffle. There are a couple of things to keep in mind, though:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>You only can win once. If you don’t win one day, you should try your luck the next day - you got 25 chances!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am using a paid-for version of <a href="https://www.rafflecopter.com/">Rafflecopter</a> for the Give-Aways. With Rafflecopter you can get multiple entries by following someone on Instagram, Twitter, visit a page on Facebook, follow a Pinterest page or susbscribe to a Mailing List. This increases your chances to win, but is not mandatory. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Rafflecopter Widget is integrated with <a href="http://www.random.org/">Random.org</a> and it choses the winner. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once you won, I contact you via the provided Email address and you have 24 hours to reply. If I don’t hear from you, I imagine you don’t want the item and will let Random.org chose a new winner.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Posts go online in the morning around nine-ish, and the raffles close at midnight - Finnish time. Rafflecopter then will show the name of the winner after I pushed that button, this keeps posts to a minimum.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is open to everyone. As in from Australia to Zimbabwe, prices are send everywhere (unless noted otherwise).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Possible Import Duty taxes and fees are paid by the winner. If you’re not willing to pay these, don’t compete. </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>8.. You can’t bribe me or anyone involved to win. You use the item(s) on your own responsibility. Use common sense.</p>

<h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>You can participate via the Rafflecopter widget by registering with your Email or your Facebook accoount. Please make sure for either option that it’s an Email address you regularly check, so when I contact you you get the email. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is usually one mandatory option to answer to participate. This can be something fun or a question about the price in question. You should be easily able to answer the question by reading the text or visiting the manufacturer website. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can get additional entries which improve your chances of winning. This could be visiting a Facebook page or following someone on Twitter, Instagram and the like. It’s a good thing to do, and also allows you stay up-to-date with news about the HiF Advent Calendar and the company sponsoring the prize.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>How would you spend four days in the Kaiserwinkl?</em> </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22268160414/in/album-72157653403675729/" title="Zahmer Kaiser"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5828/22268160414_ccb4435651_b.jpg" width="1024" height="598" alt="Zahmer Kaiser" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We had one objective for our visit to Kaiserwinkl: Do one of the Via Ferrata and shoot some great photos. We got that done on our first afternoon - and now had plenty of time on our hands to do other cool activities. First on our list was packrafting.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22864936066/in/album-72157653403675729/" title="Taking in the view"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5783/22864936066_5e965e21ff_b.jpg" width="1024" height="684" alt="Taking in the view" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="packrafting-on-the-tiroler-ache">Packrafting on the Tiroler Ache</h2>

<p><em>Could I loan your packraft?</em> Vincent asked me before the trip. Sure, no problem. <em>And could you teach me some packrafting, too?</em> Again, no problem, after all I enjoy <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/guided-trips/">teaching packrafting</a>. </p>

<p>We joined <a href="http://ack-koessen.at/?page_id=6">Adventure Club Kaiserwinkl</a> on one of their Adventure Rafting trips, this made transport very easy and I didn’t need to bring paddles or safety gear along. Dressed up in a neoprene suit with a vest and helmet and a paddle we set off to the entry point close to Kössen. The Tiroler Ache is a beautiful river, and the ~7 km section we would packraft would run through deep canyons which have a lot of history - there were smuggler paths in the war through the forests, and a pretty castle stands high above the river. </p>

<p>After some instructions and tips for the packrafting newbie we were off on the fast flowing river, and it was nice that we didn’t need to paddle a lot. The rapids were easy (up to Class II) and especially the Waschmaschine rapid was super fun. Vincent mastered them superbly and it was such a good run that we decided to come back a second time a day later. You could paddle until the Chiemsee in Bavaria, Germany on the Tiroler Ache so there’s plenty of potential for a Microadventure on this river. Wel also met some cool paddlers who were eager to test my packraft, and later shared a beer and some Kanebulla with them at the parking lot =)</p>

<h2 id="canyoning">Canyoning</h2>

<p>We almost didn’t need to take our neoprene suits off before the packrafting - because we were <a href="http://ack-koessen.at/?page_id=14">Canyoning</a> before it! I have been canyoning once before at the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2012/06/adventures-around-lago-didro.html">Lago d’Idro</a> in Italy and loved it. There’s just something very exciting and exhilarating when you enter a deep canyon and know the only way out is following the river down. Jumping over 10 m waterfalls into deep, cold pools sounds crazy - but is so much fun, and definitely a memorable experience. </p>

<p>We drove to a deep canyon with Markus Dagn, our guide from <a href="http://ack-koessen.at">Adventure Club Kaiserwinkl</a> and after a short walk up to the canyon we started with a rappel into the canyon. After Markus pulled the rope there was just one way out: Down the canyon. We jumped into pools, rappelled down waterfalls and slid down smooth rocks that the water has formed over centuries. Far above us was the green roof of the trees and the blue sky, but around us where the dark walls which seemed to be tipping over. After a bit less than an hour and plenty of jumps into cold pools we came out of the canyon, with a big smile on our face. We high-fived each other, rolled the neoprene suits down to let the warm sun on our skin and hiked back to the car. </p>

<h2 id="an-e-mtb-tour-to-the-heuberg">An E-MTB Tour to the Heuberg</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.kaiserwinkl.com/sommer/radsport/e-bikes.html">Electrical Mountain biking</a>. Yes, I was <em>a bit</em> sceptical about this activity. But I also was curious - we have been pondering getting an E-Assisted Cargobike for a while and this would be a good opportunity to see what such an Electric motor on a bike can do. Well, it can do a lot. The 940 m of ascent didn’t make me even break into a sweat, as the E-assist motor is so efficient and powerful that we were just <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/336849079">flying up the trails</a> to the Heuberg. </p>

<p>We picked the Heuberg because it is a scenic, cone-shaped peak and the views from it should be good (they are!). The ride up was fast and also involved some hike-you-e-bike and a short hike without bikes to the summit, and the ride down taught me the lesson that on the downhill it’s smart to put the e-assist off unless you want almost bomb down into the forest. But E-Mountainbikes: There’s no challenge anymore in pedaling up the hill. It doesn’t matter how steep the hill is, as long as you’re able to sit or stand on the bike the motor will pretty much drive you up. Which I enjoyed. But at the same time I wouldn’t do it again. I’d prefer to pedal up with my own power, or then push the bike. If you like it - then you’re in luck: There’s plenty of recharging stations in Kaiserwinkl and it’s part of the largest E-Bike network in the world! There’s ~1.000 km of cycling paths in nine different regions and 45 towns, and loaning an E-MTB is as easy as walking into the <a href="http://www.kaiserwinkl.com/de/sommer/radsport/e-bikes/e-bike-akkuladestation.html">Tourist Information in Walchsee</a>.</p>

<h2 id="via-ferrata">Via Ferrata</h2>

<p>There’s three <a href="http://www.kaiserwinkl.com/en/summer/hiking/climbing.html">Via Ferratas close Walchsee</a>, one beginner VF and two in the D and D/E difficulty. We decided to go for the Bergkameraden Steig. It’s steep at the beginning and has after the bridge some overhanging sections, but after that it gets easier and the descent is going through the nice forest and you come out directly at the Ottenalm Café, where you can grab a coffee and cake to reward yourself for the good climbing you just did! The Via Ferratas all get the afternoon sun and can get hot, so take something to drink along when you go in!</p>

<h2 id="visiting-the-kaiserwinkl">Visiting the Kaiserwinkl</h2>

<p>This was my first visit to the Kaiserwinkl, and I enjoyed it a lot. The highlights definitely were the tasty Kaiserschmarrn at the Fischerwirt, that is an absolute recommendation to go &amp; taste when you visit Walchsee. Also the activities were a lot of fun, with the packrafting and canyoning being the activities I enjoyed the most. Besides these there are plenty more things you can do, from hiking &amp; mountaineering to paragliding and swimming in the lake, Kaiserwinkl offers it all, always with the great view on the Wilder and Zahmer Kaiser mountains. </p>

<p>I travelled to Kaiserwinkl and Walchsee after my visit to <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/11/spring-adventures-in-kronplatz.html">Kronplatz</a>, that was very easy as we just jumped of the train in Kufstein (a beautiful city, by the way) and got a ride with <a href="http://taxikitzbichler.jimdo.com">Taxi Kitzbichler</a> to Walchsee. As Kaiserwinkl is a mere 130 km from the Airport in Munich it’s also possible to hire a car at the airport and drive to Walchsee yourself, though it’s easy enough to get around with public transportation or bikes.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22668169527/in/album-72157653403675729/" title="Walchsee"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5631/22668169527_0fb7f46a1a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Walchsee" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We stayed at the <a href="http://www.bellevue-walchsee.at">Ferienclub Bellevue am Walchsee</a>, which is a rather large hotel and hence has a lot ot offer, especially if you’re going with the family: There’s a large swimming pool inside and outside, a Sauna area, lots of play grounds and a kindergarden when the parents want to relax an afternoon. You can rent bikes and they have good food. Oh, and they’re directly at the Walchsee lake, so fishermen can just jump into a boat and try their luck. </p>

<p>Walchsee is just one of several small villages in the <a href="http://www.kaiserwinkl.com">Kaiserwinkl</a>. It’s small enough that you can walk everywhere, but there’s plenty of nice Cafés, Restaurant and shops that you don’t get bored. And there’s plenty of great outdoor activities available - as you saw above. There’s more photos on Flickr in the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/sets/72157653403675729/">Kaiserwinkl Album</a> to get you in the mood for a visit to this beautiful corner of Tirol!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Would you like a camera that goes from wide angle to super zoom up-close with just one lens for your outdoor adventures? Then look no further than the DMC-FZ1000, Panasonic’s Super Zoom with a super-sweet Leica 25 - 400 mm lens! </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22925198412/in/dateposted/" title="Panasonic DMC-FZ1000 Top Shot"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5643/22925198412_4cfd6c8c07_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Panasonic DMC-FZ1000 Top Shot" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Panasonic suggested I try their new <a href="http://www.panasonic.com/fi/consumer/video-ja-digitaalikamerat/lumix-digitaalikamera-point-shoot/dmc-fz1000ep.html">Lumix DMC-FZ1000</a> Super Zoom camera and see how I liked it for my trips. I was a bit sceptical at first - it’s a big camera for me, lenses can’t be switched and I wasn’t sure if I need a 400 mm long lens. But always curious to try something new, I agreed to take the camera out for a few trips - that was in autumn 2014! It’s been a longer than usual loan, which probably gives you already an idea that I do like to use this camera. And not just I like it, a couple of photographer friends comment that the Leica lens on this camera makes pretty sweet photos with nice colours and contrasts. But from the start.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22925195532/in/dateposted/" title="Panasonic DMC-FZ1000 On"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/637/22925195532_315575d3e5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Panasonic DMC-FZ1000 On" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>As with the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/02/sony-rx100iii-field-report.html">Sony RX 100 III</a>, first a look at my (updated) requirements for a camera:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Print-quality photographs</li>
  <li>High Burst mode and fast Autofocus</li>
  <li>Nightshots possible</li>
  <li>HD Video capable</li>
  <li>Tiltscreen</li>
  <li>Long battery life</li>
  <li>Easy to use</li>
  <li>Lightweight</li>
</ul>

<p>The DMC-FZ1000 weighs with lens shade (23 g), battery (51 g) and SD Card (7 g) 854 g total. Add in your strap of choice and a <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/01/peak-design-capture-pro-camera-clip.html">Peak Design Capture PRO plate</a> and this will be around 900 g for the camera et al. That’s more heavy than other cameras I use, but still lighter than a modern Full-Frame DSLR which often weighs around 1,5 kg with a standard kit lens. Add in a 400 mm lens and you might look at complete weight of over 2,5 kg or more - nearly three times the weight of the Panasonic DMC-FZ1000. Overall I didn’t find the weight a big deal, though it’s bigger than my usual cameras which during transport sometimes is a bit more of a hassle. </p>

<p>The handling however is very nice. The shutter button sits comfortably at the front on the protruding hand grip, where also the zoom lever is. The camera zooms fast and the focus is quick. Something I really like is the silent shutter, the camera can take photos completely without noise, which is great if you photograph in nature or do street photography. For a full-on look at the technical details I as usually send you to my colleagues of <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/panasonic-lumix-dmc-fz1000">DP Review</a>, who gave the Panasonic DMC-FZ1000 their Gold Award and loved their 1-inch sensor which <em>produces excellent image quality</em>. Besides the 1 inch sensor I would blame that great image quality also on the superb Leica F2.8-4 lens. </p>

<p>The results of the lens + sensor + creative photographer means you get stunning images in print-quality. Over the year that I have used the FZ1000 the photos I shot with it have appeared in half a dozen or more magazines. The camera shoots in RAW with the files ending up between 18 and 23 MB in size after converting them to DNG. The battery life is also pretty good, I usually get three to four days of use out of the battery, or around 600+ photos. That high number is likely due to the fact that I rarely review photos on the go or watch photos from the screen.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22939018535/in/dateposted/" title="Photos taken with the DMC-FZ1000 that have made it into magazines"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5657/22939018535_51439dbaab_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Photos taken with the DMC-FZ1000 that have made it into magazines" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22925199962/in/dateposted/" title="Swivel screen on the Panasonic DMC-FZ1000"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/655/22925199962_3c247d62a5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Swivel screen on the Panasonic DMC-FZ1000" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Speaking of the screen, it’s a swivel screen that turns 180° to the front as well as up &amp; down which makes it great for filming yourself, shooting low on the ground or above your head. If you use the screen (which isn’t a touchscreen) or the high resolution XGA electronic viewfinder you have the possibility to let a <em>“water-level”</em> be displayed which shows you if your frame is aligned evenly to the horizon. I found this at the beginning a bit annoying, but as I often take photos on the go I started to like this feature quite a bit and found it very useful. Unless I was shooting from above my head or low on the ground I was by the way using the EVF which I found very comfortable. It has a large eye-piece which blocks out the outside light fairly well, and the small screen is high in contrast and is also easy to check or review a frame from. </p>

<p>Around the big lens there’s a very nice focus/ zoom ring which is easy to use if you’re into manual zooming/ focussing. I myself prefer the lever and using the cursors to set focus points and let the camera get it, but if you want to be more hands-on I can see how this might be useful. The lens also has an Imaging Stabilizator which can be switched on and off and comes in handy if you’re shooting at 400 mm handheld. </p>

<p>A feature which I really like is the Timelapse function. For some of my work it is important to be myself in the photo, and as I didn’t want to buy a remote for the FZ1000 and didn’t want (or could, as I was shooting myself packrafting) run to the camera for the self timer the Timelapse function is a great feature. You can set in-camera the amount of photos the camera should take as well as the time between shots - say take 200 photos, each 5 seconds apart. The FZ1000 then either assembles the images in-camera into a timelapse movie and saving you a work step on the computer, or you can just let it save the photos separately. Either way, it’s a great feature that I find very useful - both for photography and making Timelapse movies.</p>

<p>So lets look at some of my other requirements and see how the DMC-FZ1000 performs there:</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/21836572460/in/album-72157645805765757/" title="Aurora Borealis"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/656/21836572460_c48aab5ce1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Aurora Borealis" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Nightshots possible ✓</p>

<p>Once you figured out the settings it is surprisingly easy to take beautiful photos of the stars and aurora borealis, as the above photo shows. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15877047812/in/album-72157647589227685/" title="Christoph trying Godspeed, 7c, Dyno"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7478/15877047812_70a9fb2bc2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Christoph trying Godspeed, 7c, Dyno" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>High Burst mode and fast Autofocus ✓</p>

<p>The FZ1000 can shoot 12 frames per second (fps) which is great for sports photography. The Autofocus is snappy and fast which means you end up with more usable shoots to pick your frame from. </p>

<iframe width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zugVQS52VPA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>HD Video capable ✓</p>

<p>Press the red button on the top of the camera and you start filming, or switch the dial to the Manual Movie mode to have some more control over the settings. The output in HD is crisp and beautiful with superb Stereo sound, and you can take photos while filming without interrupting the movie. The FZ1000 can record 4k Video at 100Mbps so if you’re dealing in high-quality video this camera is ready for it. If you want an <a href="http://amzn.to/1MA5xqg">external Microphone</a> - you’re in luck, that also can be attached to the Hotshoe and has a jack on the left side. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15909703263/in/album-72157645805765757/" title="Winter Bliss"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8641/15909703263_1634276c02_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Winter Bliss" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>So what are the short-comings for an outdoor photographer with the DMC-FZ1000? Well, it is chunky. Chunky and big like a DSLR, although that allows for a good handling. I also would have wished that it would have had a constant maximum aperture, and maybe that it would have had a Bulb function and be compatible with my <a href="http://amzn.to/1WMuDZE">Pixel Wireless Shutter Remote</a>. The list is pretty short, because the FZ1000 has a lot of good sides. </p>

<h2 id="the-bottomline">The Bottomline</h2>

<p>The Panasonic DMC-FZ1000 has a lot speaking for it: Great images out of the camera, 4k Video, an awesome Timelapse function, the superb Leica 25 - 400 mm lens with f2.8 to 4 and a very intuitive and easy handling. Yes, it is a bit more heavy and bulky in comparison to other system cameras, but if you want a large focal length spectrum without carrying a couple of lenses then the FZ1000 quickly is lighter than a system with comparable lenses. The Autofocus is very fast &amp; reliable which is great if you photography sports or kids. Did I already mention the beautiful photos it makes? Well, it does make very good photos with vivid colours which can be printed in large sizes. If you want a camera quiver of one and don’t want to deal with carrying more lenses for different lengths, the Lumix DMC-FZ1000 is worth a look. </p>

Vincent and me visited it earlier in May and went paragliding, hiking and almost did a Via Ferrata! </p>

<!-- more -->

<p>After an enjoyable journey to Bruneck in South Tyrol via München Airport it was time to explore the region. I had quite a lot of things planned for the three days I was there, but that first afternoon I was “free” and so just went for a stroll through the fields surrounding the Hotel Rudolf and checking out the Sauna. Well rested, it was off to bed early.</p>

<h2 id="via-ferrata-furcia-rossa">Via Ferrata Furcia Rossa</h2>

<p><strong>Or: Hiking in the Fanes-Sennes-Prags National Park</strong>. The Furcia Rossa Via Ferrata was the main reason for this trip, and <a href="http://matthiaslarcher.com">Mountain Guide Matthias Larcher</a> picked me up early in the morning. We got along well right from the start, both being dads and loving the mountains we had plenty to chat about on the drive to the <a href="http://www.suedtirol.info/en/Destinations--Things-To-Do/Hiking--Mountaineering/Nature-Reserves/detail/c28fb61a-bb63-451e-9d93-8fa0fb034f16/Fanes-Senes-BraiesFanes-Sennes-Prags-Nature-Reserve.html">Fanes-Sennes-Prags National Park</a>. We arrived to an empty parking lot, packed the last bit of kit and then were off. The trail was steep from the start until we reached a high valley, where we hiked on nice wide trails to the start of the Furcia Rossa. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22274601863/in/album-72157653077170250/" title="Wide paths in the Fanes-Sennes-Prags National Park"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/701/22274601863_117a322167_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Wide paths in the Fanes-Sennes-Prags National Park" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Snow had fallen up higher during the previous night, and Matthias wasn’t sure if we would be able to actually do the Via Ferrata completely. After we took a turn and followed the a sign to the Via Ferrata, we came across the first fresh snow patches. The higher we got the more snow there was, and while I was once again wearing approach shoes which had good grip in the snow, it looked like a not very smart undertaking to continue further up - Matthias thought the steel wires likely will be covered underneath quite a bit of snow, and while it is an easy Via Ferrata it is very long and takes a whole day to complete. </p>

<p>As the snow got shin deep and the weather looked like it will turn to the worse, we decided together to call it a failed attempt and just turn around. We had a wee lunch as we were back at the main trail, and then just enjoyed the lovely scenery which we had all to ourselves on this late May day. In the early afternoon as we were back at the car we had <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/336849083">clocked in some 18 km</a> and lots of nice views. Also the Fanes-Sennes-Prags National Park looked well off the beaten track and Matthias told me that while it gets busy in the main summer months, pre- and post-summer you almost can have the trails to yourself. Definitely a Nationalpark I want to check out more in the future.</p>

<h2 id="messner-mountain-museum-ripa">Messner Mountain Museum Ripa</h2>

<p>There are six <a href="http://www.messner-mountain-museum.it/en/">Messner Mountain Museums</a> and the region Kronplatz has two: <a href="http://www.messner-mountain-museum.it/en/ripa/museum/">Ripa</a> in the old, beautiful Bruneck castle and the brand-new <a href="http://www.messner-mountain-museum.it/en/corones/museum/">Corones</a> which opened this summer after my visit. We went to Ripa and really enjoyed it, especially the Meditation cellar with the beautiful music was a real highlight for me, and I could spend more time in such a place:</p>

<iframe width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zugVQS52VPA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>At Ripa the exhibition presents mountain people from Asia, Africa, South America &amp; Europe, and reflects on their cultures, religions and tourism activities in their regions. There’s quite a bit if original art which was very beautiful and inspiring, as were the different views on the cultures and how the mountain people have lived. The main tower has a viewing platform which has a great view of Kronplatz Mountain, Bruneck and the valley.</p>

<h2 id="hiking-up-to-the-kronplatz">Hiking up to the Kronplatz</h2>

<p>After the visit to the MMM we went for a stroll through Bruneck, had some light lunch and a coffee and then decided to hike up to the Kronplatz. After 14 o’clock we left the hotel with our light packs for the summit, and the staff was a bit concerned that we might not make it to the top and back as it was supposed to be a long walk. The signs suggested that one needs four hours from Reischach to the summit, though we did it <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/336849087">in about two hours</a>. </p>

<p>The AVS trail up was OK, it was a tad boring at times but it was an efficient trail which didn’t make any detours, which at least I appreciate. At the top it was windy, and the noise from the construction site for the sixth and final Messner Mountain Museum also wasn’t pleasant, but the views were great. From the top of the Kronplatz you have a great view on the Dolomites - if you don’t mind the ski lifts and water reservoirs. Alas, those are a part of the modern ski business.</p>

<p>After hanging out at the summit plateau for a while we headed down again, and the narrow trail sections were so awesome that I just needed to run parts of them down! The light of course was getting much better the lower we got, and we both lamented that we needed to head back down for dinner! In the end we did the ~1000 m of ascent in around 5 hours up and &amp; down, so if you’re a fit trailrunner who looks for some vertical this might be a nice hill to run up and down.</p>

<h2 id="paragliding-with-tandemflights-kronplatz">Paragliding with tandemflights Kronplatz</h2>

<p>We actually wanted to fly the previous day, but the strong winds didn’t allow us to start. At 7 o’clock in the morning, three hours before our train would leave again, Chris messaged me to let me know that he’ll pick us up at 8 o’clock and we would go paragliding! Vincent and me were ecstatic that it would work out after all. Punctually Chris and Leo from <a href="http://www.tandemflights-kronplatz.com">tandemflights Kronplatz</a> picked us up and we were in no time again at the summit of the Kronplatz where we had been just the previous afternoon. Just that this time we would be flying down instead of running the trails =) Leo &amp; Chris had the paragliders deployed in a couple of minutes, gave us instructions of what to do during take-off and landing, and then we were just waiting for the right wind. Once that moment came we were off in the air. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22883756982/in/dateposted/" title="Paragliding IV"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5697/22883756982_29126e838a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Paragliding IV" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>This was my second time paragliding and it was just as exciting as the first time. Even Chris and Leo, who have tens of thousands of flights between each other, had big smiles and were enjoying the great wind &amp; weather on this spring morning. We were some 15 to 20 minutes in the air until we came closer and closer to the ground, flying over freshly cut fields and walkers on their way to the summit. </p>

<h2 id="off-to-south-tyrol">Off to South Tyrol</h2>

<p>I love <a href="http://www.suedtirol.info/en/">South Tyrol</a>. I imagine it has to do with the family holidays that I spent there as a child, the friendly people, tasty food, the Dolomites and wonderful scenery. If I’m free to go wherever I want, chances are I will pick Südtirol. And if you like mountains, beautiful nature, great National Parks and trails, friendly locals and delicious food, chances are you too will love South Tyrol - so give it a try on your next holiday.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22503687709/in/album-72157653077170250/" title="Signs on the top"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5651/22503687709_10c60caec3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Signs on the top" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I travelled to South Tyrol via München and then took the train. It is a pleasant journey and if you’re in no hurry then I can recommend this. The <a href="http://www.mobilcard.info/en/mobilcard.asp">Mobilcard Südtirol</a> allows you to travel with all busses and trains in the region and is ideal if you arrive with public transportation. You can take bikes along in the trains which makes bike tours through the valleys very easy - drive to your destination and hop on the train back or vice versa. Best of all, if you stay at a hotel in Südtirol you will often get the Card for free. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22709206980/in/dateposted/" title="Local train"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5833/22709206980_477d8af5b4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Local train" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I stayed at the superb <a href="http://www.hotel-rudolf.com">Rubner Hotel Rudolf</a> which delighted me with its very friendly staff, tasty food, comfy bed and relaxing sauna. It’s a great hotel 15 minutes walking outside of Bruneck in Reischach and an equally long walk to the lift station, so in a great position. They have <a href="http://www.hotel-rudolf.com/preise_sommer.html">affordable prices for summer</a> so would make for a great hotel to base yourself for a week - the Sauna and swimming pool were superb and very clean, and make for a great way to end a mountain day - be it hiking, climbing or paragliding. A shuttle to the railway station and back is included, too!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.kronplatz.com/de/bruneck">Bruneck</a> is a lively town which has everything to offer what you might need for an active week in South Tyrol. I counted a handful of outdoor and sports shops, a dozen cafés and a few supermarkets for snacks and local delicacies. It has its own railway station and also is easy to reach by car if you prefer that. </p>

<p>For the trekking Magazine I went out and hiked in the three breathable insulation jackets (think Polartec Alpha) and evaluated if it’s a garment type that’s useful for hikers &amp; backpackers or can be ignored.

<h2 id="day-5">Day 5</h2>

<p>Early mornings were the norm on the Via Dinarica for me, and this final day was not different. At six in the morning I was up and soon I was sitting with my friends Olja, Kenan and Tim at the breakfast table. It might be hard to imagine, but the breakfast at the <a href="http://www.umoljani.com.ba/index.html">Restaurant &amp; Pension Umoljani Bjelašnica</a> was even better than the dinner the previous evening: Local cheeses and honey, tasty warm bread, ham and marmalades - and all of it locally made. Add in a great coffee and you have the energy for a long day. </p>

<p>Before we would be climbing up Maglić we had a two hour car ride in front of us. I tried to nap as much as possible, but the stupendously beautiful scenery made that difficult. We drove through deep canyons next to raging rivers on narrow roads, and all of it looked just so gorgeous that one could have spent a fine day exploring little paths off the road. The views got wider &amp; wider and after one and half hours we passed the first signs for the <a href="http://www.npsutjeska.net/?jez=en">Sutjeska National Park</a>, the oldest National Park in Bosnia and Herzegovina and home to a large waterfall and a primeval forest. We drove up into the park, parked the car, packed up - crampons, harness, <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/petzl-sirocco-helmet.html">helmet</a> and ice axe come along - and started to hike. </p>

<p>The trail takes us through the forest, and soon we hike again on snow. Kenan leads the way and here and there we see the trail markers on rocks &amp; trees, and while the ground is covered in snow it is warm and the trees have already the first green leafs. After about an hour Kenan remarks that we must be in Montenegro now, and in front of us towers Maglić. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22681941816/in/dateposted/" title="Maglić in sight"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5703/22681941816_2e73e9d5d6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Maglić in sight" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The views are superb and we can see far into Montenegro, while we walk again over short stretches of grass &amp; past crocuses. It does not take long and we’re again on snow, but now it’s the steep kind. We put the harnesses on, take the ice axe in hand and start off. While Kenan and Olja wear mountaineering boots I have my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/05/arcteryx-acrux2-fl-gtx.html">Arc’teryx Acrux² FL GTX Approach Shoes</a> on, and while the crampons in my pack would fit on them I decide to go on without. The shoes have shown me on this trip that they are great on snow, so I decide I rather be fast &amp; nimble without crampons.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22707957975/in/dateposted/" title="Through the easy snow"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/606/22707957975_07eb2933ab_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Through the easy snow" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>After the first snow field we continue on a steep path which is secured a bit with a Via Ferrata cable in places, but the going is easy so the cable is largely ignored by us. Then we arrive at a 70° chute which is covered in snow, and here I decide it would be smart to rope up. Olja and Kenan agree, and a few minutes later I cross the chute first. After that it is again a mix of dry, steep paths and snow fields up to the summit ridge, where we arrive around three hours after we left the car. </p>

<p>From here it is an easy stroll to the summit of Maglić &amp; some 20 minutes later we stand at the post and high five each other. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18521853943/in/album-72157650519579023/" title="Maglic, highest summit of Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/308/18521853943_2a621a239a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Maglic, highest summit of Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>We put on insulation layers, get food &amp; drinks out and take in the view while enjoying the fine weather. The warm sun makes it comfortable to sit up on the summit and we spend quite a while up there to photograph, sign the summit register and eat. I then pack up and steal away in front of Kenan and Olja to shoot a few wide angle shots of the two on the summit.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22719124081/in/dateposted/" title="Kenan and Olja on Maglić Summit"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/701/22719124081_b1591ca111_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Kenan and Olja on Maglić Summit" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The two catch up with me, we rope up again for the descent and then it’s down, down, down. Descending snow slopes in approach shoes is possible but it is more comfortable in mountaineering boots I can now tell you. A mere 3 meters before the end of the snow slope I slip and manage to self-arrest, but the damage is done: Kenan smiles at me and lets me know that <em>“I told you approach shoes are no good”</em> :D </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22694377202/in/dateposted/" title="And down again"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/616/22694377202_8f21860065_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="And down again" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>After that we cross the chute again and then are going back to the car as fast as we can. We’re all hungry and thirsty - the sun has been shining the whole day again. On the way back to Sarajevo we stop at a nice road side restaurant where we eat a tasty dinner before we need to continue to Sarajevo, where we arrive late in the evening And so another fine day on the Via Dinarica went by. </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes you just can’t avoid travelling light - when you go on an expedition, a climbing &amp; mountaineering trip, or a holiday with the family. But just like you don’t want to carry a heavy backpack that weighs empty 3 kg you also don’t want a heavy duffle bag. Happily <a href="http://arcteryx.com">Arc’teryx</a> thinks like that too - and has designed the one duffle which rules them all: The Carrier Duffle Series. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22303936419/in/album-72157659948633968/" title="Arc&#x27;teryx Carrier Duffle 35, 50 and 100"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/679/22303936419_3b4ae731b5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Arc&#x27;teryx Carrier Duffle 35, 50 and 100" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Carrying gear on mountaineering and <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/08/love-the-dolomites-tour.html">climbing trips</a>, heading out for a <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/04/winter-family-adventures-in-pyha-luosto.html">winter trip with the family</a> or travelling with the kids to visit my relatives in the Netherlands &amp; Germany means I need to carry a much bigger load then if I’d hit the trail alone backpacking. After having a close look over the options - from really heavy &amp; durable suitcases to heavy duffles - I quickly ended up deciding that I should get an <a href="http://arcteryx.com/ProductFind.aspx?language=EN&amp;category=Packs&amp;subcat=Duffle_Bags">Arc’teryx Carrier Duffle</a>. It ticked all the boxes which are important for me:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It is Ultralight</li>
  <li>Waterproof</li>
  <li>Comfortable to carry</li>
  <li>Easy to pack</li>
  <li>Durable</li>
</ul>

<p>The Carrier Duffle 100 l duffle weighs just 689 g empty, with the 50 l duffle being 538 g and the small 36 l duffle being 383 g. If you compare this with <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.co.uk/travel-bags/">other duffles</a> on the market you realize that these are quickly one kilogram or more empty. While in comparison with a suitcase or one of these <a href="http://bit.ly/1KAlU0a">wheeled luggage carriers</a> that’s still “light” I always found that still too heavy and was using a large waterproof stuff sack to transport big amounts of gear. That was until I found the Arc’teryx Carrier Duffle.</p>

<p>Besides being ultralight it is also waterproof. If you’re out with a pulka in winter, canoeing with kids or camping in the Alps, wetness is always a possibility so a waterproof duffle is mandatory for me. The Arc’teryx Carrier Duffle has taped seams and is made from  N400r-AC2 nylon 6 ripstop fabric, which I have found to be highly waterproof on my excursions. The material is also really durable and can take the hardest abuse on the planet: Airport luggage handlers. These guys don’t seem to know how to treat gear gently, and I have often enough seen my gear tossed &amp; thrown on the conveyor belt - or next to it. My 50 l duffle has been across Europe with me in the last two years and besides a bit of dust - it still is like new.</p>

<p>The inside of the duffle is white which makes it easier to find stuff, and the large zipper makes it easy to pack. The cords of the zippers can be treaded together or can take a lock if you want to make sure that nobody gets inside without permission. What is also important with a duffle for me is the ease of carrying. The Arc’teryx Carrier Duffle can be worn like a backpack which is great for walking from terminal to terminal at the airport or hauling gear to camp or the canoe. It also can be worn over the shoulder which is OK with the smaller models, though I find pulling the straps tight, rolling the ends to get them out of the way and carrying it at one of the four haul loops more comfortable than over a shoulder. These haul loops also are great to attach the duffle to e.g. a donkey or canoe.</p>

<p>I own three of the four available Carrier Duffles: The small <a href="http://arcteryx.com/product.aspx?language=EN&amp;category=Packs&amp;subcat=Duffle_Bags&amp;model=Carrier-Duffle-35">35 Carrier Duffle</a> which was a gift for all participants of the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/06/arcteryx-alpine-academy-chamonix-2015.html">2015 Arc’teryx Alpine Academy</a>, a black <a href="http://arcteryx.com/product.aspx?language=EN&amp;category=Packs&amp;subcat=Duffle_Bags&amp;model=Carrier-Duffle-50">Carrier Duffle 50</a> which has been along on many, many trips during the last two years and the massive <a href="http://arcteryx.com/product.aspx?language=EN&amp;category=Packs&amp;subcat=Duffle_Bags&amp;model=Carrier-Duffle-100">Carrier Duffle 100</a> which carried all my climbing and backpacking gear on my two week hiking and climbing trip to the Dolomites this year. I also use them at home to store gear in an orderly fashion, that’s easily moved when cleaning the house - true multi-use! If you only want one, here’s how I’d pick the right size:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Solo traveller: 35 l Carrier Duffle - Big enough to carry extra gear besides what’s in your Carry-On</li>
  <li>Couple travellers: 50 l Carrier Duffle - Carries climbing ropes and a rack as well as some garments and equipment</li>
  <li>Family of three or four: 75 l Carrier Duffle - Plenty of space for toddler toys, clothes and everything you need with kids on the road</li>
  <li>Family and expedition traveller: 100 l Carrier Duffle - A Tardis = Just bring it all</li>
</ul>

<p>What could be better? Well, for starters I would wish the carrying straps would be treaded just the other way around, so that the long, lose end can be easily stowed underneath the cushioned carrying strap and don’t hang around. I also think the duffle would be even easier to pack if it had a U-Zipper, though this likely would increase the weight a bit - but would making finding something and packing the pack in an orderly fashion easier. </p>
