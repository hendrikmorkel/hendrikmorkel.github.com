    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Macedonia?</em> As I was invited to the AdventureNEXT Balkans conference and the possibility of exploring this small Balkan country I didn’t hesitate long and said yes. Several days of hiking, climbing, mountaineering, caving and paddling adventures were to be had, and big smiles and wide views to be experienced. </p>

<h2 id="skopje-the-capital">Skopje, the capital</h2>

<p>I arrived late in the evening in Skopje, the capital of Macedonia, and was lucky enough to share a ride with three fellow AdventureNEXT attendants to the hotel. While I was travelling since 4 am of that day I didn’t feel like hitting the hay just yet, and so I went with James and Bernard to explore the centre a wee bit. Unknown to the outside world there were daily peaceful demonstrations in Skopje, called the colourful revolution. The signs of these could be seen on the dozens of monuments in the centre, as the demonstrators threw colourful bombs on them. We walked past the river to the central square and then on a more busy street back to the hotel, where I finally felt tired enough to hit the hay. </p>

<p>The next morning I went off on my own to explore the city more. There’s an old castle on a hill overlooking the city, which made for a easy first destination. The entry to it is free and you get some nice views towards the centre and the hills behind it, as well as the distant mountains which we would be exploring a bit later on. After that I took a look at the Mosque Mustapha Pasha, which was a beautiful building. While I am anti-religious I really like Mosques with their Minaretts and their calls to prayer. They are beautiful structures and the people one meets there are in my experience always friendly and kind, much unlike what mainstream media would like you to believe about Moslems. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/27143388722/in/album-72157666107618714/" title="Skopje Fortress"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/8/7417/27143388722_cab6e0aa1a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="655" alt="Skopje Fortress" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I wandered downwards towards the Old Bazaar of Skopje, where plenty of shops offered their goods for trade. Impressive was the street of gold, where one jewellery store was to the next and I was just left but wondering: Who has the money to buy these things, or are they cheap? As I’m also not really into gold, silver and diamonds I didn’t find out and just strolled on through the narrow streets of the Old Bazaar. Delicious smells from small restaurants wafted through the air and I was reminded by my stomach that it might just be time to eat. After I changed some Euros into the local currency I found a nice restaurant which served a delicious plate of kebap and salad. The old gentlemen was friendly and warm, and even when we didn’t share a common language we were able to communicate with hand &amp; feet and I got what I wanted. </p>

<p>With a belly full of good food and after a coffee I went on to explore the city more - the large square where pompous classical music was blarring out of hidden speakers, and then I wandered over the old Stone Bridge and was pondering for a moment if it would be possible to still take a hike up the hill next to the city. But the clock was late and I was about to meet my fellow adventurers, so I headed back to the hotel. After a dozen introductions we went for another exploration of Skopje, and much to my amusement it was almost identical to the round I made on my own in the morning. This time, however, we had our guides along who were able to tell us a bit more about the buildings, structures and monuments. It was very interesting, and if you like to explore old cities then Skopje is definitely worth a visit. </p>

<h2 id="hiking-climbing-and-paddling-at-matka-canyon">Hiking, climbing and paddling at Matka Canyon</h2>

<p>Matka Canyon is a mere 40 minute bus ride away from downtown Skopje so I already was fearing it’d be overrun with visitors who wanted to escape the city for the weekend. However, it was happily not the case! Our bus dropped us off at a bridge which crossed the river and then we hiked on a fine singletrack trail up into the mountains. It was simply lovely hiking with great views and lush green flowers &amp; plants along the track. We glimpsed views into the canyon and also towards our destination up on the hill, where we would be climbing in the morning. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/27240432415/in/album-72157666107618714/" title="Trail markers"><img src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/8/7739/27240432415_ea7a1873aa_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Trail markers" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>As we arrived up on the hill a beautiful old &amp; small monastary welcomed us and there was already quite a bit of activity from local climbing club members - there was going to be a climbing festival there this weekend from the <a href="">Macedonian Alpine Club</a>, and after us a steady stream of climbers arrived throughout the morning. Our guides set up a top rope and everyone was encouraged to go and try the fairly easy route, and almost everyone made it to the top 30 m higher up - even those who were climbing the first time in their life! I was eager to get some more climbing in and did one more route on a nice arete, but then it was sadly already time to move on as we were scheduled to go paddling. </p>

<p>The packs came back on and then it was happily just downhill until the shore down in the canyon. We rang a bell which resulted in a boat coming over to pick us up and ferry us over to the other side, where we quickly changed into clothes which could get wet - as we were going to be paddling for an hour in sit-on-top kayaks. I paired up with Avery, a fellow Journalist, and soon we were finding our rhytm and navigated our kayak over the turquoise waters of the Matka Canyon. After an hour of paddling through the steep canyon we arrived at a cave which some of us went in, but as I didn’t bring any shoes &amp; didn’t fancy walking through bat poop I waited outside. Just as we set out to paddle back we could hear the distant thunder in the mountains, and so it meant faster paddling in order to not get soaked and electrocuted by lightning. </p>

<p>Obviously we made it out alive, and as we were back on the shore it was time for lunch - at 17 o’clock! We had a short transfer to a local restaurant which served delicious vegetables which were grown in the garden behind the house and while we munched our starters a Gipsy Brass Band entered the local and set off to play for us. It was a great atmosphere as these passionate musicians played their instruments, and many of us felt the beat and one saw wipping feet. Well fed and feeling tired after a day of hiking, climbing and paddling we drove back to Skopje. As the next morning we would transfer to another area of the country it meant packing up - happily I travelled light!</p>

<h2 id="standing-on-a-summit-and-watching-into-kosovo">Standing on a summit and watching into Kosovo</h2>

<p>In case you didn’t know: I really do not like the transportation part of travelling. Bus and train rides as well as flying are pretty boring and a utter waste of time for me, and riding in a bus on small mountain roads which wind up the hill in serpentines is about the last ting I really want to do. Alas, this was what was in store for us this morning. We rode for several hours to Staro Selo where we transferred into 4 x 4s which shuttled us up the mountain to the Vila Ljuboten. This, happily, marked the end of the first transportation part of the day, and from here on we’d be using our own feet to move. </p>

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28244664756/in/dateposted/" title="Ljuboten Summit Sign"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7034/28244664756_5aa3bfb076_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Ljuboten Summit Sign" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>After sitting for over three hours in a bus and car moving my feet in the mountains was exactly what I wanted, and happily also Tim, Matthias, Avery and Bernard felt that way. We set at a good pace off from the hut, with the goal being the summit of Ljuboten. Alas, in a big group the speed goes down pretty quickly, and so the five of us made a break-out and went ahead. Soon we reached a sign post &amp; decided it’d be just the right thing to do to wait for our guides and the rest of the group, and ask for permission to go ahead to the summit. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/27663642853/in/dateposted/" title="Looking back"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8584/27663642853_1fb5e764a5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Looking back" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28244650176/in/dateposted/" title="Ljuboten Summit in the far distance"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8655/28244650176_d525edab57_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Ljuboten Summit in the far distance" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Upon reaching us the guides gave us permission to make a summit attempt, and with the weather being a mixed back and a thick layer of snow on the ridge to the summit we weren’t sure how far we would come, so if our attempt would be crowned by success was unsure. For starters it was easy hiking until the upper snow field, and as a group of Macedonian mountaineers were just coming down from the summit we decided that we could also try it. The ridge towards the summit of Ljuboten falls pretty steep off towards the left, and just slightly less to the right, so it was careful hiking upwards.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28200770821/in/dateposted/" title="Snowy Ljuboten Summit ridge"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8758/28200770821_7ac74e6c7a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Snowy Ljuboten Summit ridge" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We were surprised how easy &amp; short it was in the end to reach the summit. We smiled and enjoyed the views as we stood on the broad summit shoulder: Down into the clouds towards the north we looked into Kosovo, and down towards the south we could see far into Macedonia. The clouds were racing around us, it was windy and there was thunder in the distance, so after a summit selfie we carefully proceeded to descent. The snowy ridge demanded concentration when going down, but as soon as we left the snow behind it was fast &amp; easy hiking again. We soon met up with the rest of our group which were waiting further down for us, and then we decended together towards the Vila Ljuboten and again a rather late lunch. After such a fine hike the food tasted amazing, and while the Macedonian kitchen often felt like it was the same the natural ingredients and fresh mountain air made this probably one of the best meals I ate in Macedonia. </p>

<h2 id="caving-with-bats-at-makedonski-brod">Caving with bats at Makedonski Brod</h2>

<p>After that tasty lunch we had another bus travel section, and we arrived at dawn at our next hotel close to the Mavrovo National Park. I slept in a beautiful apartment overlooking the village, but the real treat was definitely waking up and seeing the mountains from my window the next morning. Sadly instead of going to explore the surrounding mountains and villages on foot we had another transfer that morning, but happily it wasn’t too long. We arrived at the basecamp of the <a href="http://www.ursusspeleos.com.mk/index_en.htm">Macedonian Caving Society</a>, and after dressing up in our red overalls and helmets we were off to the Gorna Slatinska cave with our guides.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26633789634/in/album-72157666107618714/" title="Valley view"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/8/7070/26633789634_f2c37ae3a9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Valley view" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26633789054/in/album-72157666107618714/" title="Signage"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7319/26633789054_7296213f7d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Signage" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Now I’d lie if I didn’t say that I was thinking <em>Meh</em> about the caving before we entered the cave. I was not really excited about the whole caving thing, but what followed really was my favourite part of this Multi-activity trip. The Gorna Slatinska cave is around 400 m long and we needed with our group of six around 45 to 60 minutes from one end to the other. Those 400 m under the earth were just fantastic, with stalagmites and stalactites which grew over hundreds of years, small chambers and tight spots which one needed to squeeze through and then small climbs to get up or down. And of course the bats. I’d go as far as saying that Batman is my favourite comic character (Rorschach from Watchmen being a close second), so being in a cave with bats was just a very cool experience. There were hundreds of bats of all sizes flying around us, or hanging sleeping from the ceiling. As we exited the cave and the sunshine was again shining on us I had a huge smile on my face. I would do this again in an instant as it was just such a outlandish yet inspiring experience, so if you’re not too afraid of tight spaces I would urge you to go and explore the Makedonski Brod caves!</p>

<p>Well, after I looked a last time into the mouth of the cave which I just had exited we walked the short distance back to the basecamp, where one of the guides was already busy at the BBQ grill. While the other group went to explore the cave we were having a beer and chating excitedly about the experience, and as our friends were back we shared a delicious feast of vegetables, beans, chicken and meats before we headed onwards to Ohrid and the AdventureNEXT conference - that, however, is another story for another day!</p>

<h2 id="getting-there--accommodation">Getting there &amp; accommodation</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.turkishairlines.com/">Turkish Airlines</a> flew me from Helsinki via Istanbul to Skopje and I need to say as far as airlines go they do a very good job. Punctual, friendly and with full service (yes, that means a 3-course meal in economic class as well as an <em>“open bar”</em>) I really liked my flights with them. They have their own Chef on board which apparently cooks for the business class passengers, but who then also would happily help out in the back of the plane. </p>

<p>The trip I was on was organized by <a href="http://www.macedoniaexperience.com">Macedonia Experience</a> which I found a friendly &amp; professional outfit. The guides knew what they were doing (always good when setting up anchors for climbing, paddlling, moving in the mountains and caving) and looked after evryone in the group. We had a condensed version of their normal <a href="http://www.macedoniaexperience.com/active/2013-04-05-15-20-38/multi-active-tour-of-macedonia">Multi-Activity Trip</a> and the normal tour you can book is longer and more relaxed. If you don’t want to go off exploring by yourself but rather have someone who has taken care of everything, give them your business.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/27143419452/in/album-72157666107618714/" title="That way to climb Multi-pitch"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7791/27143419452_3a8de46cbf_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="That way to climb Multi-pitch" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>In Skopje we stayed at the <a href="http://www.duvet.mk">Hotel Duvet</a> which was central, clean and friendly. I liked the breakfast terrace overlooking the city towards the hills, and the rooms were pretty big (in case that’s important to you). </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.vilaljuboten.com/">Vila Ljuboten</a> at the foot of the mountain of the same name also offers very basic rooms, so if you want to stay up in the mountains that would be a good place. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.bistra.com">Hotel Bistra</a> in the Mavrovo national park has great rooms and apartments overlooking the valley, and their breakfast &amp; dinner is also fantastic. If you’re into slowfood, herbs and spices this place is well worth checking in to, as the owner has a wealth of knowledge in this area and is happy to share it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Can’t wait for ultralight gear news from the OutDoor 2016 anymore? I have you covered and show you a selection of new ultralight tents and backpacks, new shoes and apparel to make your hiking, climbing, backpacking and camping lighter! </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28115365671/in/dateposted/" title="#OutDoorFN 2016 is coming!"><img src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/8/7304/28115365671_6eee8bb41d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="1024" alt="#OutDoorFN 2016 is coming!" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>While the <a href="">OutDoor 2016</a> kicks off first in two days I already got a lot of information on new gear coming in 2017. Please keep in mind that I haven’t actually seen, touched or tested these items so all information are to be taken with a grain of salt and they still might change until they stand in stores in 2017. I will try to try on, lie in and walk in many of the items seen here while on the fair, but that also is just to get a taste of them and not a final judgement.</p>

<p>Instead of going by company in this teaser update, I will just go by categories. And as everyone loves tents and shelters, those make the start!</p>

<h2 id="tents--shelters">Tents &amp; Shelters</h2>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28202203836/in/dateposted/" title="Nordisk Lofoten 1 ULW"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8899/28202203836_45182594ba_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Nordisk Lofoten 1 ULW" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The <strong>Nordisk</strong> takes the Ultralight crown this year with the Lofoten 1 ULW, as it has a claimed weight of just 490 g with a pack size of 11 x 22 cm. It’s a two layer tent with mesh doors, aluminum poles, Dyneema cords and Titanium stakes, and a repair set is also included. No info on Price or if you can sit in it, which I hope to find out on the fair =)</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28158403041/in/dateposted/" title="Vaude Hogan SUL 1-2P"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7292/28158403041_8a334f8656_b.jpg" width="1024" height="788" alt="Vaude Hogan SUL 1-2P" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>Vaude</strong> is revamping their Hogan tents which are especially popular with cyclists. The Vaude Hogan SUL 1-2P will weigh around 1.100 g and has a size of 235 x 110 cm. The larger tents which sleep two and three are a bit more heavy and wider, and a new model called Invenio has two doors opposite of each other. All these tents will have 5 years of warranty on them, too.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/27955414880/in/dateposted/" title="Marmot Bolt 2P tent"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7580/27955414880_d37d27d22e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Marmot Bolt 2P tent" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Also <strong>Marmot</strong> comes out with a new lightweight tent. The Bolt 2P tent weighs 1.040 g and sleeps two. It will cost 500 € and will be in the shops from February 2017 onwards. The Specs: 20 D Polyester Fly, large entry, full mesh inner which can be pitched on its own on fine, mosquito-infested days, and there should be good sitting height.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/27622202004/in/dateposted/" title="MSR Advance Pro 2"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7465/27622202004_960a5ac09e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="767" alt="MSR Advance Pro 2" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>MSR</strong> launches a great looking Alpine/ Ultralight backpacking tent, the Advance Pro 2. It weighs 1.300 g packed and will retail for 585 € and should be available from Spring 2017. It has very durable Easton Syclone poles which are made from a carbon and aluminium composite. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28133567382/in/dateposted/" title="Therm-A-Rest Tranquility 6 Tent"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7308/28133567382_f5b719952b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="599" alt="Therm-A-Rest Tranquility 6 Tent" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And lastly <strong>Therm-A-Rest</strong> enters the Camping (Glamping!) Market with their Tranquility™ 4 and 6 tents. These weigh 5,19 kg and 7,87 kg respectively, sleep four or six people, have standing height and cost 530€ or 650€.</p>

<h2 id="backpacks--packs">Backpacks &amp; Packs</h2>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/27955415580/in/photostream/" title="GREGORY Paragon 48"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7320/27955415580_a36fa460e3_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="GREGORY Paragon 48" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The <strong>GREGORY</strong> Paragon 48 weighs 1.450 g and is one of several light-ish packs. The Paragon is the Male model while the Maven is the Women’s model. Available in four volumes from 38 l to 68 l these packs will cost between 160€ and 240€. It comes with an Aerolon carrying system which can be adjusted in length to your body and if you want to lighten it further up you can remove the top lid and use the inside compartment divider as one. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28158403401/in/photostream/" title="Vaude Zerum 48+ LW Backpack"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8623/28158403401_31584c1521_b.jpg" width="788" height="1024" alt="Vaude Zerum 48+ LW Backpack" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Zerum 48+ LW Backpack from <strong>Vaude</strong> concludes the German company’s step to offer lightweight versions for the big 3 (The <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/vaude-alpstein-450-down-decke/?pid=10239">Alpstein 450</a>, which I helped design &amp; test, launched last year). The pack comes in three sizes - 38 l, 48 l and 58 l. The medium 48 l pack weighs 1.180 g, has a PFC-free EcoFinish to let rain and dirt pearl off and is made from a light 70 D Rip-Stop. It has a light version of the Vaude Tergolight Carrying system.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/27959237640/in/dateposted/" title="Ortlieb Bikepacking Packs"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7317/27959237640_24dbd89364_b.jpg" width="1024" height="631" alt="Ortlieb Bikepacking Packs" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And <strong>Ortlieb</strong> enters the Bikepacking Framebag market (see my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/02/bikepacking-bag-manufacturers.html">Bikepacking Framebag Manufacturer List</a> to see smaller companies making custom and Multi-size bags). The German company launches a Framebag (which comes out next year) and a Handlebar bag and Seatbag, both which are already available. The Seatpack is 430 g light and costs 130€, while the Handlebar Bag is 417 g and costs 100€. The former has a volume of 5 to 16,5 l while the latter packs 15 l of gear, with an Accessory-Pack for the Handlebar pack (206 g and 55€) which adds 3,5 l more. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/27955807950/in/dateposted/" title="Petzl GriGri 2017"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8880/27955807950_30cd44dc42_b.jpg" width="1024" height="841" alt="Petzl GriGri 2017" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>Petzl</strong> seems to be launching a new GriGri - at least that’s my guess going by the above photo which was in my invite to their booth =) </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28236552315/in/dateposted/" title="Black Diamond Ropes"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7782/28236552315_c09b4b94c5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="695" alt="Black Diamond Ropes" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>Black Diamond</strong> enters the rope market. Available will be four different ropes: The 7,8 Half- and Twin-Rope, a 9,2 Triple Certified Rope and two Single Ropes in 9,6 and 9,9 diameter. They have a Full-Dry finish and will be available in lengths of 35 m, 40 m, 60 m and 70 m. </p>

<h2 id="footwear">Footwear</h2>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28132885632/in/dateposted/" title="Merrell Agility Peak Flex"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7330/28132885632_1916b41a48_b.jpg" width="1024" height="737" alt="Merrell Agility Peak Flex" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The new <strong>Merrell</strong> Agility Peak Flex above is a new trailrunning shoe which has the new FlexConnect midsole. A Hyperlock Heel construction should lock in your heel while the breathable mesh upper makes it a solid choice on hot days. The shoe has a drop of 6 mm, 5 mm deep lugs on the sole and is available from spring/ summer 2017 onwards.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28203030476/in/dateposted/" title="Scarpa Epic Lite OD"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8702/28203030476_116bcc28d8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="717" alt="Scarpa Epic Lite OD" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>From <strong>Scarpa</strong> comes the Epic Lite OD, with OD standing for OutDry, the waterproof-breathable membrane. It’s an approach shoe which should do well on Via Ferratas and hiking in the mountains. Again we have a Sock-Fit upper construction, and the laminated OutDry® membrane should keep your feet dry - from the inside and out. Underneath a Vibram Megagrip sole ensures you don’t slip away if its wet.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28237378245/in/dateposted/" title="Dachstein Spürsinn EVO"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/8/7426/28237378245_0d8bb01408_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Dachstein Spürsinn EVO" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>Dachstein</strong> is a new brand to me and their Spürsinn EVO shoe sounds really great. It has a sock-like, knitted shaft and has been developed with the blind mountaineer Andy Holzer. It is supposed to have a great feeling of what’s under your foot with the Vibram EVO 2.0 sole, and a shoe weighs 340 g in Size 42. The upper is made from mesh for breathability, and it has a climbing zone in the front which make sit good for Via Ferratas and approaches. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/27623441363/in/dateposted/" title="KEEN Versago"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8700/27623441363_e244f52796_b.jpg" width="990" height="1024" alt="KEEN Versago" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>KEEN</strong> is another new company for me and their Versago is a shoe that combines great looks for urban use and functional details which should make him great on your hikes and runs. The upper and tongue wrap around your foot like a sock and are made from mesh, while the midsole has the S3™-Technology which gives stability and cushioning on demanding terrain. It comes in four colours and will retail for 110€. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28206488956/in/dateposted/" title="Arc&#x27;teryx Norvan VT"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8724/28206488956_62d94be9cd_b.jpg" width="1024" height="165" alt="Arc&#x27;teryx Norvan VT" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The <strong>Arc’teryx</strong> Norvan VT is the latest shoe of the Canadians. This trailrunning shoe weighs 300 g in Men’s Size 8,5 UK or 320 g as a GTX shoe. The last 2/3 of the shoe have a Vibram Megagrip sole which ensures grip on wet &amp; dry terrain alike, while the front one-third has a Vibram Idrogrip sole which ensures you can scramble well on your Via Ferratas and approaches. Arc’teryx built the shoe for <em>alpinists and climbers who use trail running to increase their fitness, and dedicated trail runners looking for new territory to explore</em>. And the 360⁰ Support System should help you with that, as you can decrease the volume and ensure a climbing-like fit when you tighten it, and release it again for the running sections of the trail. They will cost 165€ for the non-lined version and 190€ for the GTX shoe, available from spring 2017 onwards.</p>

<h2 id="apparel">Apparel</h2>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/27955412350/in/photostream/" title="Marmot Airlite Jacket"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8668/27955412350_a66b834307_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Marmot Airlite Jacket" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>Marmot</strong> launches the Airlite Jacket which will make UL backpackers and trailrunners happy, as it only weighs 102 g - and will “only” cost 120€. Made from Nylon Ripstop Stretch it is stretchy so great for running in the rain. It is supposed to be very breathable and of course keeps wind and rain at bay, with a hood and a zippered pocket, too. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28158404561/in/photostream/" title="Vaude Zebru UL 3L Jacket"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7471/28158404561_db0eb2d21c_b.jpg" width="788" height="1024" alt="Vaude Zebru UL 3L Jacket" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The <strong>Vaude</strong> Zebru UL 3L Jacket weighs 198 g in Size L and is a hardshell with a PFC-free finish. It is made of a 3-layer Ceplex Pro-Membrane which should keep you dry and out of the wind and is also breathable. If that’s too heavy for you then the Zebru Windshell Jacket and the Zebru Windshell Vest which weigh 90 g and 70 g respectively might be more interesting!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28158406361/in/photostream/" title="Vaude - 95% PFC Free from 2017 onwards"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8620/28158406361_5d168437f4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Vaude - 95% PFC Free from 2017 onwards" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Another great news from <strong>Vaude</strong> is that 95% of their range will be PFC-free from 2017 onwards. They will use almost exclusively PFC-free DWRs on their jackets and already faced the harmful substances out in other areas of the manufacturing chain. Great news for users and the environment!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28203717286/in/dateposted/" title="OMM AVA Jacket Womens"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8841/28203717286_a2e3050061_b.jpg" width="1024" height="1024" alt="OMM AVA Jacket Womens" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And <strong>OMM</strong> launches the AVA Jacket, a sub-200 g fully featured mountain running jacket made from a new eVent DVSTORM 3 layer fabric. The OMM Team was focused on creating innovative closures around the wrist, waist and face and I am very much looking forward checking it out in person. It has an Dynamic Droptail to keep you bottoms a wee bit more dry in the rain, YKK Aquaguard zips and a newly designed Multi-Cuff. </p>

<h2 id="materials">Materials</h2>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/27959054270/in/dateposted/" title="THERMORE® ECODOWN®"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8824/27959054270_c78701c88d_b.jpg" width="961" height="453" alt="THERMORE® ECODOWN®" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>Thermore</strong> Ecodown is a synthetic down which is made completely from recycled PET bottles. It is available in 8 variations (60, 80, 100, 115, 130, 150, 170, 200 g/m2) and in 20 different thicknesses, allowing manufacturers to create your favourite puffy jacket with a environmentally friendly material. Available immediately I hope many companies will start to use this material soon. </p>

<h2 id="accessories">Accessories</h2>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/27956036160/in/dateposted/" title="Exped Care Line"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7454/27956036160_c186d35f27_b.jpg" width="850" height="710" alt="Exped Care Line" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>Exped</strong> launches their own Care Line products. Prices range from 3,95€ for the Down Cleaner to 8,95€ for the Tent Cleaner. Additionally there will be products for Gear Waterproofing, a Mat and Backpack Spray Cleaner and a Sleeping Bag Spray Cleaner. Expect them from March 2017 onwards.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28159489101/in/dateposted/" title="Katadyn BeFree"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/8/7330/28159489101_bacdf0c0e4_b.jpg" width="964" height="830" alt="Katadyn BeFree" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><strong>Katadyn</strong> launches this September their BeFree Waterbottle &amp; Filter. The soft bottle has an integrated 0,1 Micron hollow fibre filter in it, which can be replaced. The soft flask is 0,5 l and from Hydrapak. Usage is super-simple: Fill the bottle, screw on the filter and drink! </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28239138305/in/dateposted/" title="Outdoor Tech Kodiak Plus 6"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8858/28239138305_93497e20f7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="1022" alt="Outdoor Tech Kodiak Plus 6" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Kodiak Plus 10 from <strong>Outdoor Tech</strong> is a 10k mAh Powerbank which weighs 308 g and will cost 80€. The Lithium battery is obviously rechargeable, and with two USB Ports it’s easy to keep several gadgets charged when out on the trail. It’s a compact size and best of all, it should be available already this October.</p>

<h2 id="january">January</h2>

<p>In January I was again on <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/02/aland-in-winter.html">Åland</a>, this time as a Hostblogger with NBE Finland. It was a superb trip and I loved showing our beautiful country to my fellow blogger friends.</p>

<p>In February I went <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/02/ski-touring-south-tyrol-and-salzburger-lungau.html">ski-touring in South Tyrol</a> with my brother, and then we continued to Austria and the Salzburger Lungau. It was a great trip with some good, and some not so good snow.</p>

<p>March started off in Switzerland, where my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/03/teaser-graubunden-haute-route.html">Graubünden Haute-Route Tour</a> didn’t go according to plan. But we had a great time nevertheless, and that’s what counts.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25455047716/in/album-72157665020355632/" title="Going down."><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/2/1445/25455047716_5a5b16aa20_b.jpg" width="1024" height="684" alt="Going down." /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>March was also the month of skiing and winter activities with the family. First we were in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/04/hetta-winter-adventures-in-finnish-lapland.html">Hetta</a> and had a lot of fun with Huskies, XC skiing and winter hiking, followed by a few nights in Ylläs and then Levi.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26148429495/in/album-72157665518007630/" title="Mom, dad, kids and seven huskies!"><img src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/2/1490/26148429495_885653ee53_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Mom, dad, kids and seven huskies!" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>A husky Tour in Hetta is a must in our opinion. It’s so relaxing and fun!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25333253494/in/album-72157665518007610/" title="Powder turns on Kesänki"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/2/1649/25333253494_d679a86349_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Powder turns on Kesänki" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>While Ylläs is known as the XC Ski Mekka of Finland I loved the ski-touring, too. Imagine finding perfect snow and you can make the first turns!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/28044201296/in/dateposted/" title="Santa&#x27;s Cabin in Levi"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7797/28044201296_a750b77c3b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Santa&#x27;s Cabin in Levi" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Santa’s Cabin on Levi is a wee bit off-piste and was built for the Finnish Santa movie from a few years back. It’s a beautiful cabin with a great view.</p>

<h2 id="april">April</h2>

<p><a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/05/lyngen.html">Lyngen</a> with Henryk scores high as the most memorable ski-touring trip of the year. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25455047716/in/album-72157665020355632/" title="Going down."><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/2/1445/25455047716_5a5b16aa20_b.jpg" width="1024" height="684" alt="Going down." /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>With sunsets like these it is easy to understand why Northern Norway is a photographers paradise, and equally popular amongst climbers &amp; skiers.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26148754883/in/album-72157665452784994/" title="What a view!"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/2/1694/26148754883_8441890563_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="What a view!" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And also the skiing is pretty awesome, as Henryk here shows.</p>

<h2 id="may">May</h2>

<p>In may I was on the AdventureNEXT Conference in Macedonia, and went afterwards to Meteora in Greece. The Balkans are a gorgeous region with untapped potential for hiking, climbing, packrafting, bikepacking and will enchant you with the lovely people, tasty food and the pristine mountains and nature.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26965428300/in/album-72157666107618714/" title="Climbing"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7295/26965428300_4a48114bb5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Climbing" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The climbing in Macedonia was great, and I am looking forward to sample more of it in the future.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26505575123/in/album-72157666107618724/" title="Hiking in Meteora"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7060/26505575123_422cb17f12_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Hiking in Meteora" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The same I can say about Meteora in Greece. What an outstandingly beautiful place! </p>

<h2 id="june">June</h2>

<p>In June we went on summer holidays with the family to <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/06/impressions-from-the-bregenzerwald-in-vorarlberg-austria.html">Vorarlberg</a> in Austria. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/27700551721/in/album-72157667276500013/" title="Sunrise on the Kanisfluh"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7180/27700551721_12abb83624_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Sunrise on the Kanisfluh" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>That one morning where the sun shone, everything came together on the sunrise hike on the Kanisfluh.</p>

<h2 id="onwards">Onwards</h2>

<p>The next six months look pretty good too. Next week I am off to my annual <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/06/outdoorfn-2016-is-a-go.html">OutDoor pilgrimage</a>, then it is likely to Ireland and Wales, a visit to the south in November, dozens of research trips in Finland and in December I hope to be hunting some snow again. So, <strong>how has your outdoor year been thus far?</strong> What was the most memorable trip, and which trip in the second half of 2016 are you most looking forward to! <strong>Let us know in the comments!</strong></p>

<p>I have reviewed the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/05/black-diamond-alpine-start-hoody.html">Alpine Start Hoody</a> before, but I felt that after another two years of intensive use it’s time to highlight once more how much I love this wind jacket. I use it almost daily, when out with the kids, cycling, and it is the first thing that I pack when I go hiking &amp; backpacking. After so many years it is not so water-resistant anymore (even when I clean it regularly with special detergents), but it still holds the wind out like a king. There’s a little hole in the left sleeve where I was bushwhacking, its a bit dirty at the cuffs from the almost daily use, but other than that I still love this jacket heaps and I’d be my first recommendation if someone is looking for a wind jacket/ softshell. / 204 g in Size M</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.arcteryx.com/product.aspx?language=EN&amp;gender=mens&amp;category=Shell_Jackets&amp;model=Alpha-FL-Jacket">Alpha FL Jacket</a> is an ultralight Gore-Tex Pro hardshell which is made for fast &amp; light alpinism, and hence is great also for ultralight backpacking. Sure, there are even lighter hardshells out there, but this is such a great fitting jacket for me that I don’t think I need to continue the hunt. It takes all the abuse I throw at it - from jamming myself into a crack in the rain to hiking through the undergrowth - which I like a lot. The sleeves are a wee bit longer and so keep the hands dry when gloves stayed at home, the one pocket is again useful for some small items like my <a href="http://amzn.to/28SNH4J">camera</a>, and if not needed it packs down to a volume of one litre and disappears in the pack. There’s noting superfluous on this jacket, it allows me all the crazy moves I could come up with and looks good - what else do you need from a hardshell? / 270 g in Size S</p>

<p>I have used the <a href="http://bit.ly/28OMBTX">Patagonia Nano-Air Hoody</a> now over a year, from hiking the IAT in Ireland over ski-touring to spring and summer hikes across the globe. It’s in combination with the Alpine Start Hoody currently my most worn insulation layer, though it’s really a breathable insulation layer as it is made from Patagonia’s FullRange material (think Polartec Alpha). It’s a super-stretchy piece, not wind-resistant but in combination with a wind jacket a great layering piece. I have been sceptical about breathable insulation materials, but after a week-long autumn hike in the rain and sleet of Sweden I was convinced. It’s great to have a piece on that keeps you warm when you stop and doesn’t heat up too much when you’re moving, especially in wet and cold weather. In warmer weather (anything over 10°C for me) it’s too warm, though, and I’ll shed it as soon as I start to feel too hot. It’s not too warm on its own either, but with a wind jacket or hardshell on top it’s a good insulation piece. With four pockets it’s also good for keeping stuff close by (snacks, camera batteries and a gas canister when you get closer to camp). The shell material is pretty sensitive, though, so bushwhacking in it will destroy it in no time, as will intense rock contact. / 352 g in Size S</p>

<p>The Arc’teryx Satoro AR Zip Neck LS isn’t available yet in the shops as it launches in the autumn. I was given one when I visited Arc’teryx in Vancouver for the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/12/arcteryx-procline-carbon-lite-ski-boot.html">Procline Ski Boot</a> and <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/12/arcteryx-voltair-avalanche-airbag.html">Voltair Airbag Launch</a>, and have used it ski-touring and hiking over the last six months. Made from Merino wool and a synthetic core it combines the benefits of the two materials. The baselayer has a great fit for me (as have all Arc’teryx pieces with an Athletic cut) and I like the feel of the material on the skin. It stays odour-neutral pretty long, five or six days is no problem. The little chest pocket is good for e.g. a camera battery and SD card, and the long front zipper is great to dump heat. The price is pretty steep, though. / 202 g in Size S</p>

<p>The from Coefficient Vest Black Diamond is not easily available anymore and that’s a sad thing in my opinion. For ages I have been a fan of vests, and this fleece vest is a really great layering piece in all seasons. Ski-touring in winter, hiking in spring and mountaineering &amp; backpacking in summer, the Coefficient Vest has been a faithful companion. The Powerdry fleece ist toasty warm and wicks sweat further away to the outside, and it’s pretty warm for its weight, too. It’s a slim-fit piece that’s slightly longer so especially good in winter. / 225 g in Size S</p>

<p>More of a urban outdoor piece for me is the <a href="https://www.norrona.com/en-GB/products/falketind/falketind-long-sleeve-shirt-m/">Norrøna falketind longsleeve</a>, a beautiful and super-comfortable longsleeve. Made of drirelease wool which is a mix of wool and Polyester it is soft on the skin, and the Polygiene finish ensures it stays odour-neutral for a while (two to three days in use, I’d say). It’s simply a pretty longsleeve that feels great to wear, and a basic for me when I’m on a business trip. / 162 g in Size S</p>

Especially If I travel only with my backpack I love to take one or two of these, as I can fit all I need in them, compress the content even further and at the hotel can just pull all my clothes out in one go. The Silynlon cubes are highly-water-resistant and their different shapes and sizes mean you can get the ones that suit you best. I have a compression cube and a smaller half cube in which I can fit garments for ten days without problems (they help in packing less, but I still tend to come home with one or two shirts I didn’t wear). A useful organizing tool if you don’t want that your underwear is seen by everyone if you get something out of your backpack! / 19 g for the Half Cube, 57 g for the large Compression Cube</p>

<p>I love climbing pants because they’re comfortable and allow for freedom of movement. And if they are as comfortable and cool-looking as the <a href="http://www.marmot.de/content/en/collection_28&amp;c=703">Marmot Mono Pant</a> you can’t go wrong really. The deep pockets are great for phone, wallet and keys and there’s also a brush pocket for when you’re working on your boulder project. Great for climbing and bouldering they also work very well in the city, and as my feel-good pants they have seen a lot of use during the last year. The material is breathable yet durable, and even super-hot summer days allow you to stay cool in these. The leg cuffs an be adjusted in width so you can see you’re foot placements, too. / 325 g in Size S</p>

They are light, durable, comfortable, water- and wind-resistant, have two zippered pockets, allow for great freedom of movement and even have an integrated belt. I have used this on pretty much every 3-season hike and climb in the last twelve months, from climbing and Via Ferratas in the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/08/love-the-dolomites-tour.html">Dolomites</a> to mountaineering in Macedonia last month and <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/06/impressions-from-the-bregenzerwald-in-vorarlberg-austria.html">hiking in Austria</a>.

The two hand pockets also are good for all the other stuff you carry along. It’s a good looking pants that is at home in the city, but thanks to the bicycle cut it also is alright for medium-length rides around town.

These are the UL multi-use items: From it’s intended use as a piece of headwear you can convert it into a pot holder, water filter and towel. It’s a super useful item, and in these sunny summer months the High UV version keeps you from burning your head. / 39 g</p>

A lovely pair of shoes from the guys at VIVOBAREFOOT, sadly sold out at the moment, so if you see a pair somewhere try them on and see if they suit you. / 521 g for the pair in EU Size 42</p>

The <a href="http://adidasoutdoor.com/terrex-x-king/AF5996-6.html">terrex X-King</a> sport a sole from Continental, the car and bicycle tire manufacturer, and promise to give you superb grip. Well, I ran down muddy mountains in these and didn’t slip, sprinted over icy and snowy trails and walked up on rubble paths, always with great grip. The Speed Lacing is great (though I made the one shoe a wee bit too short almost) and also otherwise this trailrunning shoe with the low drop allows for a great feel on the trail. That’s thanks to the <em>Mountain-bike-inspired “tyres for your feet” design that’s directly moulded to the upper for added stability</em>. They’re great for hiking, too, if you’re into fast &amp; light shoes with great grip. / 567 g for the pair in EU Size 42</p>

<p>I have used the <a href="http://www.outdoorresearch.com/en/mens-seamseeker-gloves.html">Outdoor Research Seamseeker Gloves</a> for belaying and Via Ferrata hikes and have found them great in 3-season use. Especially on hot days in the Alps the open finger tips and breathable upper are comfortable and preferable in my opinion over a normal glove. The gel padding in the palm does run hot on long rappels, but otherwise they do their job well. Useful side effect: Hands get less dirty! / 98 g for the pair</p>

<p>I bought a pair Black Diamond Magnetron RockLock carabiners about three years ago, and both have seen constant use in that time. One is connected to my PAS (see underneath) and the other one is with my belay device. I like that they’re easy to operate in any season with one hand, with our without gloves, don’t freeze when ice climbing and are big and hence lie good in the hand. The gate opens wide for easy clipping, too. I have a bunch of HMS carabiners, but these two are my favourites for their ease of use. / 82 g</p>

<p>PAS stands for <strong>P</strong>ersonal <strong>A</strong>nchor <strong>S</strong>ysyem, and if you do Multi-pitch or alpine climbing then you probably know what this is. You clip into the stand (belay) with it, and the beauty of the <a href="http://www.metoliusclimbing.com/pas_personal_anchor_system.html">PAS from Metolius</a> is that the six loops all have a breaking load of 22 kN. The length is adjustable to your needs at the belay and can be long or short, and each loop having such a high breaking load means more security. It’s also light and stores compact when climbing, so for me a better system than a Daisychain or a 120 cm sling. / 76 g</p>

<p>The Furia from <a href="http://scarpa.it">Scarpa</a> is a climbing shoe for bouldering and sports climbing. I found the VIBRAM® XS Grip2 sole great for slabs and small holds alike, and friction climbing in them is a lot of fun. The toe is covered with rubber on top, too, which makes it great for toe hooks, and the heel is also covered in rubber for heel hooks. Inside it feels very comfortable and even in hot weather (25°C+ in Greece, for example) it remains comfortable. The two Velcro straps allow to adjust the shoe great to my foot, and the two straps in the back make it easy to pull the shoe on and off. It’s a more advanced shoe so beginners probably want a less aggressive shoe than this one, but if you’re climbing hard then this shoe is right for you and can help you to solve a hard boulder problem or succeed on a hard sports route. / 366 g for the Pair in Size 40 </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.grivel.com/products/rock/carabiners/25-mega_k6g">Twingate carabiners from Grivel</a> are awesome, a real innovation in the climbing carabiner market. Grivel thinks they’re just as safe a a screwlock carabiner, and I think I agree. Things must be pretty dire for something to open this in a situation, but they’re easy to use with one hand (without gloves) on the other hand. I use the one I have in different situations, and Grivel suggests you could use it from building a belay to clipping into one. It’s a tad heavy for alpine use, but works well on Multipitch climbs et al. / 76 g</p>

<p>I like sunglasses and use them year-around, almost every day. The <a href="http://www.scott-sports.com/us/en/products/2355124747192/SCOTT-Obsess-ACS-Sunglasses/">Obsess ACS from Scott</a> I can wear without problems for 12 hours straight, so comfortable they are. Made for small to medium faces they fit me very well. The mirrored glasses in red also are surprisingly scratch-resistant and they haven’t gotten a single one in the 9+ months I now have them in use. Developed as bicycle glasses they work equally well for skiing and hiking as well as strolling through town &amp; travelling. They’re pretty affordable, too, for such good shades. In some situations they do fog up a bit, but if I take them up it really just takes six seconds and they’re clear again. Great shades for just about any outdoor adventure. / 27 g </p>

<p>★★☆☆
<br />25€, available at <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/montane-softflask-trinkflasche/">Bergfreunde</a></p>

<p>At 25€ the 500 ml Softflask is far from being a bargain. It’s also not particularly light in terms of weight-to-volume. But it’s easy and convenient to use - both for drinking as well when storing the empty bottle, as it takes up just a wee bit of space. If you need a light-ish softbottle give the Softflask a look and decide if you want one. / 30 g</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just three more short weeks until the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/outdoor-fair-2015/">OutDoor</a> 2016 kicks off in Friedrichshafen, and I’m already pretty psyched for my fourth visit to the trade show at Lake Constance. Read more on why this year the OutDoor is set to be even more awesome than in the previous years!</p>

<h2 id="where-to-go">Where to go?</h2>

<p>I have a short list of must-visit places &amp; companies I want to check out at the fair - from the Trend Lounge and Black Diamond over Petzl to Adidas Outdoor, as well as the usual suspects Arc’teryx, RAB and Scarpa, plus a few more. But is there a company you - <em>yes, you reading this!</em> - would like me to visit? With <a href="http://www.outdoor-show.com/od-en/index-of-exhibitors/index.php?navid=538007229630">960 exhibitors from 40 nations</a> the list is long, so if you’re curious about a specific company why not let me know in the comments which company you think I should check out and I will swing by them at the fair to check them out &amp; report on their kit!</p>

<h2 id="bloggers-are-welcome-at-the-outdoor">Bloggers are welcome at the OutDoor!</h2>

<p>The best thing for me at the OutDoor has always been meeting the people: The contacts you exchange emails with at the companies and PR Agencies, <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/08/ueli-steck-interview.html">meeting athletes</a> and of course my fellow bloggers and Social Media mates. So I’m pretty excited about the <a href="http://www.outdoor-show.com/od-en/the-outdoor/outdoor-blogger-base.php?navid=545263545263">OBN Blogger Base</a>, which allows me to work &amp; meet fellow bloggers from across the globe. Best of all: OBN organizes every day an OBN_talk where you can learn about topics which are important to us, and the Blogger Walk across the fair promises to be a good way to meet new companies, too. </p>

<p>If you’re an outdoor blogger you totally want to <a href="http://www.outdoor-show.com/od-en/press/Blogger.php">get accredited as a blogger</a> for the fair, as it has a lot of benefits - from access to the Blogger Base to the Blogger Breakfast. And best of all: It’s free for us outdoor bloggers! Apply now for your <a href="http://www.outdoor-show.com/od-en/press/Blogger.php">Blogger Pass</a>, and then comment and lets meet up at the OutDoor! </p>

<p>And already now and during the fair you can follow the Hashtag #OutDoorFN on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/outdoorfn/">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OutDoorFN">Twitter</a> for real-time updates on the fair. I’m sure it will be super busy once the 13th of July comes around!</p>

<p>The clouds would hang a lot over the local hills of Mellau, the small village where we stayed.</p>

<p>On the next sunny day we went on the Natursprünge Trail in the Brander Valley close by where the views were superb.</p>

<p>It was tempting to just sit in the sun and drink tasty drinks that day, for sure!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>From <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/05/wild-atlantic-way.html">Ireland</a> to Britain: Bikepacking on the Wild Trails of Britain takes you &amp; your bike on the most beautiful multi-day rides in Wales, Scotland and England. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/27183101282/in/dateposted/" title="Bikepacking"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/8/7252/27183101282_48e647f3ba_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Bikepacking" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Bikepacking is a big trend these days (check the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/02/bikepacking-bag-manufacturers.html">The Bikepacking Framebag Manufacturer List</a> to see how to transform your bike into a bikepacking rig) so it was a nice surprise as I was contacted by Wild Things Publishing and a question if they could use one of my photos in the book. Sure they could! As a wee thank you they sent me a copy of the book, and as I love alternative travel guide books <em>Bikepacking on the Wild Trails of Britain</em> was right up my alley.</p>

<p>It is another beautiful book that will inspire you to pack up your bike and head to Britain in order to ride one (<em>or more!</em>) of the presented trips. From Epic Wilderness Rides over Family Rides to Technical &amp; Coastal Trails, the book presents 30 trips which range from a night to a week or riding in the countryside of Britain. The book starts off with an introduction to bikepacking and some history, some stories to get you in the mood, tips on gear - including a cool short chapter on tarps! - and how to plan a ride. In short: All you need to get on your bike and head out for a night or more in the wild. After the introduction it takes you on the different rides, which make up the majority of the book. These are sorted by regions in the UK - from the South East to the South West of England to the Midlands, Scotland and Wales. A map of the UK in the beginning highlights where these trips are to be found (good for planning) and a table on the next page gives  quick overview of relevant data about the rides - including distance, ascent and how many percent of the ride are off-road. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/27183101142/in/dateposted/" title="Bikepacking"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7326/27183101142_3113691725_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Bikepacking" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I loved the very well designed info boxes which had all needed information ready with one look, a small map which gave a good idea of the ride (though you’ll need a real map for your adventure) and the beautiful photos. The trip descriptions are entertaining little trip reports in their own which will make you anticipate your own ride even more. All in all a unique book that is beautifully designed &amp; presented. If you’re into bikepacking and want to go to Britain for a wee adventure or more, this book is a recommended read!</p>

<p>Buy it directly from <a href="http://www.wildthingspublishing.com/product/bikepacking-book/">Wild Things Publishing</a> or <a href="http://amzn.to/1Z5i3Sr">Amazon.com</a>, <a href="http://amzn.to/27UUYI3">Amazon.co.uk</a> or <a href="http://amzn.to/1Z5hJmE">Amazon.de</a>.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/27183102302/in/dateposted/" title="Wild Atlantic Way Cover"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7074/27183102302_ee6f87d84a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Wild Atlantic Way Cover" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Last year I was lucky enough to <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/04/sea-stack-climbing-in-ireland.html">explore Ireland</a>, hike the IAT and go sea stack climbing. What caught my interest and brought me to the Green Isle, however, was the Wild Atlantic Way: The world’s longest coastal touring route which goes from south to north along the west coast and is over 2.500 km long. There’s all kind of adventures to be had along the WAW, from visits in picturesque Irish villages and their pubs to bigger towns and their cultural offerings. However, <a href="http://threerockbooks.com/index.php/exploring-irelands-wild-atlantic-way/">Exploring Ireland’s Wild Atlantic Way</a> helps you find the off-the-beaten-track gems and takes you outdoors into the fresh, Irish air (and occasional rain shower!). </p>

<p>On 224 pages <em>Exploring Ireland’s Wild Atlantic Way</em> takes you from the south in Kinsale to the far north of Malin Head along the coast. In seven chapters - divided by county - you can start to explore the Wild Atlantic Way. Do you fancy surfing, sea stack climbing and lots of remote wilderness? Then head to Donegal in the north. Do you prefer a cable car ride to an island, trying your luck fishing or going cycling? Then Cork in the south is a good place to start your adventures! Wherever you decide to go, <em>Exploring Ireland’s Wild Atlantic Way</em> will have an insider tip ready for you. The seven county chapters are further divided into sections, each coming with their own little overview map to give you a feel of the land. Hundreds of gorgeous photos will get you in the mood to explore, while the detailed introduction chapter gives tips on when to come, what to bring and any other question you may have.</p>

<p><em>“Show me a climber who doesn’t know Yosemite and I show you someone who doesn’t climb.”</em> OK, I made that up, but there’s a hint of truth in that: Climbers from across the globe know the view down the valley on El Cap, heard about the epic Dawn Wall climb of Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson in 2015, and just long to stand underneath the towering granite walls of El Capitain before also they will start to scale it. Yosemite in the Fifties transportes you back in time to the iron age of climbing history in the valley, when climbers where pushing the envelope of what had been thought possible and established the routes we still climb today.</p>

<p>The book is a collection of beautiful photos of the valley, the protagonists and their climbs, all taken with cameras that relied on the skill &amp; knowledge of the operator. In between these inspiring photos are four chapters with over a dozen essays. These essays are from original source material - first-person narratives and anecdotes of the climbers and their friends, interspersed with archive photos and shots of memorabilia from back in the day. Stories range from a history of climbing tools over portraits to historic climbing routes. With over 200 pages and twenty essays <em>Yosemite in the Fifties</em> is captivating for a long time and a book one can go back to time &amp; again to let the imagination wander off once more while looking at the old photos or reading one of the adventurous stories.</p>

<p>Climbing in Yosemite is high on my bucket list so <em>Yosemite in the Fifties</em> is a book I enjoyed immensely. It’s a tasteful combination of visuals and stories, many written by John Long, one of climbing’s best writers. If climbing in Yosemite is something you also aspire to, I think you should pick up this beautiful coffee table book and immerse yourself into the history of the Iron Age of climbing in the valley. The stories and little anecdotes will surely be something that will make your wish to go to Yosemite even stronger, and once you’re standing on a ledge on El Cap Tower you will remember this book, it stories, and smile - because now you are there, and become part of its history! </p>

    <updated>2016-05-23T23:26:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://hikinginfinland.com/2016/05/a-leg-for-laufbursche</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Mateusz, backpacker and manufacturer of the ultralight <a href="http://www.ilovelaufbursche.de/english/">LAUFBURSCHE</a> backpacks, lost a leg in his battle against cancer. With this fundraiser I want to help him pay his medical bills and hopefully get a prosthesis that allows him to go hiking again. [<strong>Updated with winner!</strong>]</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="http://www.ilovelaufbursche.de/english/" title="ILoveLAUFBURSCHE.com"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7176/26188616394_48ddfab21e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="615" alt="ILoveLAUFBURSCHE.com" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Mateusz and I met the first time six years ago when he joined a group of ultralight backpackers who followed my invite for an <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2010/02/tufwt-1-0-trip-report.html">Ultralight Winter trip</a>. We hiked, laughed, camped in the snow, went to Sauna and jumped into the ice hole together, and have been in contact ever since. I was lucky enough to get one of the very first 40D black Silnylon huckePACKs, a design which was back then and still today is revolutionary. As an Architect Mateusz has a great eye for functional design, and his backpacks are considered far and wide works of art. My “Packing your framless backpack - LAUFBURSCHE huckePACK” video is probably my most-watched video on Youtube, and it is that backpack which I today will to raffle off in support of Mateusz. </p>

<iframe width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MDF26eJ2sqU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>As a fellow entrepreneuer I know that should sickness strike then shit hits the fan, and it’s sadly not different for Mateusz. Many other’s have written about his condition so I do not want to concentrate on it here, but instead send good vibes and support his way and a one-of-a-kind LAUFBURSCHE huckePACK your way. The pack is in great condition without any damage, is made of black 40d Silynlon with an XPAC floor, is Size L (which fits me at 175 cm very well) and weighs with all the straps attached 343 g. I guesstimate the volume at around 35 to 45 l, so it’s a great size for a week long trip in the mountains or woods.</p>

<p><em>So, how do you get a chance on winning this backpack AND help Mateusz?</em> </p>

<ul>
  <li>One lottery ticket costs 5€, and you can buy as many as you’d like. More tickets obviously increase your chances to win this unique pack and help Mateusz more!</li>
  <li>You Donate for each lottery ticket you’d like to buy 5€ to Mateusz via <a href="http://www.ilovelaufbursche.de/english/">this website</a> (<em>you can donate via PayPal or bank transfer, please follow the simple instructions given over there for your donation</em>)</li>
  <li>You send an Email with a screenshot of the confirmed donation to <em>laufbursche[ät]hikinginfinland.com</em> with your name and the amount of lottery tickets you purchased</li>
  <li>If you like, comment underneath to let others know how many tickets you have bought =)</li>
  <li>You can buy lottery tickets till the 22nd of May, Midnight Finnish time</li>
  <li>On the 23rd of May I will put all tickets in a hat and my son will pull out one lucky winner who gets the backpack!</li>
</ul>

<p>If you just like to help and have already enough huckePACKs, just head over to <a href="http://www.ilovelaufbursche.de/english/">I Love LAUFBURSCHE</a> and donate. Every donation is appreciated and helps Mateusz on the long trail of rehabilitation and getting back outdoors. <em>To read more about Mateusz condition head over to <a href="http://www.outdoormaedchen.de/2016/04/crowdfunding-laufbursche.html">Outdoormädchen</a>, <a href="https://limitcamper.wordpress.com/2016/04/27/i-love-laufbursche/">Limitcamper</a> or the <a href="http://www.ultraleicht-trekking.com/forum/topic/3737-ein-laufbursche-für-den-laufburschen/">various</a> <a href="http://www.ultraleicht-trekking.com/forum/topic/3626-die-gute-tat-für-laufbursche-frühling/">threads</a> on <a href="http://www.ultraleicht-trekking.com/forum/topic/3495-laufbursche-genesungswünsche/">Ultraleicht</a> <a href="http://www.ultraleicht-trekking.com/forum/topic/3504-schulterschluss-für-mateusz/">Trekking</a>.</em></p>

<h2 id="update-23052016">Update 23.05.2016</h2>

<p>Wow, what a great effort! There were donations for a total of 201 lottery tickets, with some donations which didn’t want to enter, which raised a grand total of 1.295 € for Mateusz! I imagine that helps him with getting a ultralight carbon or titanium part for his prosthesis! The winner of the huckePACK has already been contacted and I hope she will enjoy hiking with the pack =)</p>

<p>Of course we don’t need to stop now - Mateusz is still battling with the complications of his sickness, and you can still <a href="http://www.ilovelaufbursche.de/english/">donate</a> to support him. Every small donation helps, so just drink one less fancy coffee and donate that sum instead =)</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer: I have no financial benefit in this campaign. Mateusz is a friend of mine and I want to help him pay his medical bills &amp; hike again in the future.</em></p>

It’s free and includes some great stories &amp; photos, so if you see it in your local outdoor shop grab a copy and enjoy it with a glass of beer the next time you’re needing an outdoor fix!</p>

<h2 id="bike--travel-and-trekking-magazin">Bike &amp; Travel and trekking Magazin</h2>

<p>For both the <a href="http://www.biketravel-magazin.com">Bike &amp; Travel Magazine</a> and <a href="http://www.trekkingmagazin.com">trekking Magazin</a> I have been writing a company portrait of Thule, the Swedish company that’s well-known for their innovative transport solutions for bikes &amp; skis. Both pieces are slightly different, so if you want to know more about Thule’s backpack line make sure to grab a copy of the trekking Magazin while if you’re a cyclist and want to know about their panniers and child transporters grab the Bike &amp; Travel Magazin!</p>

<p>I met <a href="http://www.christine-on-big-trip.blogspot.fi">Christine</a> two years ago as she was cycling through Finland, and we spent a nice afternoon eating cake and sushi in Vaasa. Of course I knew her much longer digitally, but it was really nice to finally met her and hear more about her stories from hiking, paddling and cycling around the globe. If you’re not so lucky to meet German Tourist (her Trailname) then you should pick up a copy of her book <em>Laufen. Essen. Schlafen.</em> which was published just a month ago. It’s in German, though, so I hope your Deutsch skills are up to scratch. The book chronicles GT’s decision from first hiking one long-distance trail in the US to all three and abandoning a <em>normal</em> 9-to-5 life. </p>

<p>The book starts out with Christine as a successful business women who is on holiday in the US, to losing her job and a good friend which in turn make her decide to go hiking the Pacific Crest Trail. The hiking story reminded me in parts of Keith’s <a href="http://amzn.to/1XbLlQl">The Last Englishman</a>, a book about Keith’s PCT hike. It’s a mix of trail description, <em>trail talk</em> (gossip) and Chrisitine’s experiences on the PCT. The PCT chapter is also the longest of the 288 page long book, with each subsequent chapter getting shorter. </p>

<p>The CDT chapter then starts again with Christine the successful business woman, a romance that’s doomed from the start, and the hard hiking life on the CDT. No rest days for three and a half months! During the CDT chapter German Tourist meets friends from the PCT again, loses her job while hiking the CDT and subsequently decides to quite the 9-to-5 rat race life. The AT chapter, which is a mere fifty something pages, then feels hurried. There’s the misery at the start, the realization that she does not need to hurry anymore, more meetings with old friends from the PCT and pretty autumn hiking through the green jungle. </p>

<p>I read the book in a day and overall found it an enjoyable read. There were a few sections that made me thoughtful, sad, laugh and anticipate what would happen next. The book is entertaining, but I felt that in the CDT and AT chapter Christine was just in a hurry to finish the book and get outdoors again - I would have wished for similar insights &amp; details from her about these two trails, too. Despite this I think it is a great read for anyone who is interested in hiking and long-distance backpacking, as Christine writes eloquently about the life on the trail and what it entails. The sections about her conversations with fellow thru-hikers and trail angels where my favourites by far, and made me want to pack my backpack and fly over to the USA!

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ski-touring in late April: Daylight from 4 am till 10 pm, great powder or spring crust, wall-to-wall sunshine &amp; all topped off with that breath-taking fjord &amp; mountain view of the Lyngen Alps.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26741128546/in/dateposted/" title="Sunset"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1508/26741128546_756a100b4c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Sunset" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Together with Henryk from <a href="http://www.oooyeah.de">Out of Office</a> I spent a fantastic week in the Lyngen Alps. Here’s a wee teaser so you can book your flight tickets and accommodation there for next spring, because it most certainly is a place you want to be. It all starts in Tromsø, where already the approach by plane is breath-taking. Then you go for a walk in the old town and pick up your Van from <a href="http://www.takemeaway.no">Take me Away Camping</a> to head north-west to the Lyngen Alps and their surroundings.</p>

<p>You probably want to stop to take in the view once in a while.</p>

<p>When your bindings decides to break you go for a walk along the coast of Arnøya and make a stop in a lovely little cabin.</p>

<p>You take the ferry and enjoy the smell of the sea on deck.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26741113346/in/dateposted/" title="On a ferry"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1610/26741113346_46c00d88e5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="On a ferry" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And what’s wrong with sitting down in the sun and have a beer (after a day of skiing, obviously!)?</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26160876694/in/dateposted/" title="After-Ski beers"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1538/26160876694_c5b83977c5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="After-Ski beers" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>On the summit you snap a selfie with that big grin because the view is so amazing.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26160876794/in/dateposted/" title="Summit Selfie"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1504/26160876794_3853aab70b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Summit Selfie" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And while the tide is low you go for a walk along the beach.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26741128296/in/dateposted/" title="Evening Sunset"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1464/26741128296_d26a5e3531_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Evening Sunset" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Or you go skiing while the sun sets.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26741129446/in/dateposted/" title="Sunset skiing"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1719/26741129446_117610d8ae_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Sunset skiing" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>On blue-bird days the summits can be busy.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26160876444/in/dateposted/" title="Busy summit"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1462/26160876444_69cf794b5c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Busy summit" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>But there’s enough fjords so you can have one for yourself to enjoy the sunset.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26160876304/in/dateposted/" title="Fjord sunset"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1489/26160876304_454bd5c53c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Fjord sunset" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>So, book those tickets to Norway now, reserve your adventure van, and then check back in autumn to get the full low-down on our roadtrip ski-touring adventure.</p>
