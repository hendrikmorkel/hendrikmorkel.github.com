<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>trekking poles are for ultralight backpackers more than just trekking poles - they’re multiuse items which help you solve multiple problems. During the day they help you hike more efficient in the mountains going up and down, but at camp they pitch your tarp or shelter. The <a href="http://rutalocura.com/trekking_poles.html">Yana Poles</a> from <a href="http://rutalocura.com/">Ruta Locura</a> can do more, too: With the optional Clarkii Rod the Yana pole transforms into a tenkara fishing rod, and the optional Camera mount allows you to leave a tripod at home and use your trekking poles instead. The Yana poles are the lightest poles on the market at 105 g per pole, and they’re adjustable in length, too. Beautiful to look is the carbon material they’re made of, and so versatile in use that every ultralight backpacker should have a pair.</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>sometimes it is difficult to decide what one needs. Sure, we have thousands of wants, but what we really need is more limited. This does connect directly to ultralight backpacking, too: Sure a Five Person Double-Wall tent with wood stove is nice to have, but one does not need it for a solo trip. A tarp or <a href="http://www.outdoorline.sk/en/tents/357-hyperlite-mountain-gear-ultamid-2-pyramid-shelter.html">Pyramid shelter</a> makes much more sense. So it is nice to get some starting capital at <a href="http://www.outdoorline.sk/en/">Outdoorline.sk</a> to fulfil these real needs - be they a nice cuben shelter, a warm down quilt or a new hardshell. And as Outdoorline.sk carries great gear from ultralight brands you know it will be a good investment for something you need, want, and really will use!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/23233644179/in/dateposted/" title="Arc&#x27;teryx Procline Carbon Boot"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5694/23233644179_77ae9e38a8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Arc&#x27;teryx Procline Carbon Boot" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I was lucky enough to witness on Monday afternoon the unveiling of the <a href="http://arcteryx.com">Arc’teryx</a> ski boot line. It was a much rumoured development and what we saw today was even better than what the rumors suggested. As I have a severe Jetleg I will just make this a short and sweet post with some key points, and after (possibly maybe) having used the boot a bit more over the following few days up in the mountains I will update this post, so please stay tuned. It is smart to follow along on <a href="http://facebook.com/hikinginfinland">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/hendrikmorkel">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://instagram.com/hendrikm/">Instagram</a> as with some luck there will be live updates from the mountains about this boot and the new Voltair Avalanche Airbag there, too.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/23519476391/in/dateposted/" title="Arc&#x27;teryx Procline Carbon Boot"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/709/23519476391_c5e65555f2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Arc&#x27;teryx Procline Carbon Boot" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Coming in Fall 2016 are the <strong>six alpine touring ski boots from Arc’teryx</strong>, and together with eight colleagues from Europe and North America I am heading out to test these new boots and the Voltair Avalanche Airbag over the next three days so I will be able to give more insights on those on Friday. Here’s what I can tell you from trying on the boot and checking it out today at the exclusive product launch. The Six models are called </p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Procline Carbon Lite</strong>, the top of the line Unisex model which tips the scales at 1.190 g and will cost 730€ retail. </li>
  <li>The <strong>Procline Carbon Support</strong> will be 1.260 g in MP Size 27.5 abd costs 700€</li>
  <li>The <strong>Procline Men’s Lite</strong> will be 580€, 1.190 g in MP Size 27.5 while the <strong>Procline Men’s Support</strong> is 1.260 g and 550€</li>
  <li>The <strong>Procline Women’s Lite</strong> tips the scales at 1.060 g and the <strong>Procline Women’s Support</strong> is 1.120 g - prices are the same as the Men’s models but both have a women’s last</li>
</ul>

<p>The difference between the Lite and Support models are the liners and cuffs. The Lite liners are about 90 g lighter as the support liners and fully thermo-mouldable. Both liners are designed in-house, but are different: The <em>Lite Liner</em> is made for uphill agility and great if you have a talented ski boot fitter at hand, while the <em>Support Liner</em> is slightly better for ski performance and if you don’t have access to a ski boot fitter. The Support Liner also has, as the name suggests, more tongue and collar support. The Women’s model will have a women’s last, and all liners have a removable strap closure system. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/23306141770/in/dateposted/" title="Arc&#x27;teryx Procline Carbon Boot"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5788/23306141770_d7edb81816_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Arc&#x27;teryx Procline Carbon Boot" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The special thing about the boot - besides the ridiculously light weight of 1.190 g for the Procline Carbon Lite - is the agility it gives you. The 360° Rotating Cuff makes the boot feel more like the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/01/scarpa-rebel-ultra-gtx.html">Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX</a>. Unlike normal cuffs this cuff - available in two different configurations, one from Carbon fibre with over-injected Grilamid and in the Men’s and Women’s models the cuff is made from carbonfibre charged Grilamid  - is cut in half. Yes, you read that right: The cuff is cut in half in the back of your calf. Together with the rest of the cuff his gives you a <strong>Lateral rotation of 23° inwards and 13° outwards</strong>, which should make it much more better for skinning up difficult, steep snow or make it more agile for climbing.</p>

<p>Speaking of alpine climbing, one of the re-occurring points the designer <strong>Federico Sbrissa</strong> (keep that name in mind, I have a feeling we can expect much more great footwear innovations to come from him!) made is that these boots were <em>designed for the alpinists and also great for every ski-tourer</em>. It’s a point worth thinking about, because the things alpinist (climbers) want in boots often will be much appreciated by skiers. I mean, more agility in your boot that allows you to skin longer and keep the crampons in your pack? Great! More edge control on steep snow traverses? Yes please! More agility when using crampons? Heck yeah! </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/23234109229/in/dateposted/" title="Arc&#x27;teryx Procline Carbon Boot"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/583/23234109229_7920fba1dc_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Arc&#x27;teryx Procline Carbon Boot" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Nice about these carbon fibre cuffs is also that the pivot points - the places where metal rivets go through them - are made from plastic. And they connect to plastic. Which makes them a lot more durable than 100% carbon cuffs, which tend to wear out at the points where they touch metal. As here plastic touches plastic, they should last much longer, which is pretty cool. Once you decide to ski pull the buckle down and can hit the pow. Locking pins on the divided cuff lock into the rear spine and you have a nice, stiff boot to go down.</p>

<p>The other great innovation - well, there’s many more, but I have that jetleg and tomorrow’s another long day - is the full coverage gaiter. Made from Cordura with a PVC coating it is waterproof, a thing that both climbers and skiers will appreciate: If you climb ice in boots you don’t want ice or water coming in, and on Champagne Powder days you neither want snow in your boot, be it skinning up or shredding down. This gaiter, which is integrated with the boot shell, gives you a lot of protection and toasty feet in any conditions, be it skiing down or climbing up.</p>

<p>The Hybrid Closure System is a mix of buckle and lacing - think a Boa® closure that actually stays shut. The buckle is integrated with the cable, has 15 different positions for adjustment for an individual fit, and as the cable is connected to the buckle - once the buckle is locked in, it stays put! The cable is made from steel and the buckle from aluminium, and it is pretty amazing how well you can adjust the fit on these. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/23519518161/in/dateposted/" title="Arc&#x27;teryx Procline Carbon Boot - Hybrid Closure System"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/707/23519518161_b99c9dfedf_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Arc&#x27;teryx Procline Carbon Boot - Hybrid Closure System" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>There’s a lot more - a Power Strap without Velcro, buckles that keep in place when opened, a rockered tow, Dynafit certified toe and heel inserts, a crampon optimized toe shape with rubber cover and a Vibram sole - but I’ll tell you more about these on Friday.

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>70 meters can be short - or long if we’re talking about a Pitch on the Cassin. That you don’t want to go with a short rope climbing is clear, so the <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/beal-zonsi-101-bergfreunde-edition-einfachseil/">70 m Beal Zonsi 10.1 Single Rope in the Bergfreunde Edition</a> is a much better choice - be it for climbing the project at the home crag, train lead climbing at the gym or visit Turkey for some fine limestone climbing. At 10.1 mm diameter it can take a lot of abuse, and the weight of 63 g/ m is very reasonable for such a durable rope. The great handling and compatibility with most belay device is just another plus point for this long rope, and with 70 meters of rope you can climb Kantti at Olhava top to bottom! </p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p><a href="http://www.naturebase.de">Nature Base</a> is a small cottage from Germany which uses innovative materials to create unique products. One of these is their <a href="http://www.naturebase.de/shop/pulka">ultralight folding pulka</a> - at 490 g it’s 1/10 the weight of the lightest normal pulkas, with the difference that the folding pulka rolls up to a wee roll and so is super-easy to transport in trains, busses and planes! Once you’re up in the fjells of Lapland, you can roll it out &amp; strap your backpack to it, attach the pulling cables to yourself and start snowshoeing, hiking or skiing. If the terrain doesn’t allow for pulling - for example if you’re scrambling up steep hills - you can easily put your pack with the pulka attached to it on and go up! It’s a universal tool that makes travelling in winter more convenient and fast, so an excellent choice for ultralight backpackers and winter adventurers alike!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>Spring, summer, autumn and winter are the four seasons for us outdoor enthusiasts, and over twelve months they give us many reasons to go outside and enjoy the hills and nature. Sure, sometimes conditions might not be best - but a bit of rain, snow and wind hasn’t harmed anyone yet. Except, of course, the garments we wear: Daily use gets them dirty and stained, and often they lose the properties of protecting us from rain and wind. A good thing that <a href="http://nikwax.co.uk/en-us/">Nikwax</a> allows us to breath new functionality into our rain jackets, down coats, baselayers and shoes. <a href="http://nikwax.co.uk/en-us/products/productdetail.php?productid=268&amp;itemid=-1&amp;fabricid=-1">Tech Wash</a> and <a href="http://nikwax.co.uk/en-us/products/productdetail.php?productid=267&amp;itemid=-1&amp;fabricid=-1">TX.Direct Wash-In</a> make hardshell jackets ready for another season in the snow and rain, and <a href="http://nikwax.co.uk/en-us/products/productdetail.php?productid=1015&amp;itemid=-1&amp;fabricid=-1">Down Wash Direct</a> cleans hydrophobic &amp; regular down and restores the water repellency while maintaining their fill power &amp; insulation. The <a href="http://nikwax.co.uk/en-us/products/productdetail.php?productid=262&amp;itemid=-1&amp;fabricid=-1">Footwear Cleaning Gel</a> cleans trailrunners and hiking boots and revitalizes their breathability and water repellency, so that they are ready for more muddy trails in any season! And that’s not just great for the garments, but also for nature and us!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>photography when outside is one of the many things which gives me pleasure. Being able to share my trips with loved ones at home is just great. And the <a href="https://www.peakdesign.com/product/clips/capturepro/?acc=97">Peak Design Capture PRO</a> makes capturing these moments a lot easier, because the camera is always close by - right next to me! Connected to it in one way or another is always the <a href="https://www.peakdesign.com/product/straps/slidelite/?acc=97">SlideLITE</a> camera strap, the ultralight strap which helps me keep my camera safe when I’m hanging 140 m off the deck. And the final piece of gear is the <a href="https://www.peakdesign.com/product/covers/shell/?acc=97">Shell</a>, a stretchy fabric cover for my camera which protects it from snow, rain and dust while still allowing me to capture those special moments out on the trails and in the hills. With these three items photography outside is easy, safe and comfortable - ideal to capture every special moment!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>The <a href="http://rojksuperwear.com/en/chicks/chicks-primaloft-bomberpile-tamarillo.html">Primaloft Bomber Pile</a> jacket from <a href="http://rojksuperwear.com/en/">Röjk</a> is the kind of Midlayer that looks great on the way to the office and shows its functionality when you’re hitting the slopes. Made in Europe from the unique PrimaLoft Polyester this piece is so fluffy and warm that cold temperatures won’t stop you from enjoying your favourite winter sports, while wicking away sweat to keep you feelin’ dry &amp; toasty. The fluffy outside makes you look a wee bit like Chewbacca, which never is a bad thing, and thumbloops as well as smartly placed pockets keep drafts out and important items close by. A functional piece that’s great under your hardshell when you go down pillows of Pow and &amp; stylish if you enjoy a hot cup of Minttukakao afterwards.</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>have you heard of the packrafter’s nightmare? It’s carrying a PFD on long trips. Because traditional foam PFDs are very bulky they’re not nice to carry, and sitting in a packraft with them isn’t the most comfortable thing either. Enter the <a href="http://www.packrafting-store.de/Safety/Anfibio-Buoy-Boy::499.html?language=en">Anfibio Buoy Boy</a>, an inflatable vest that gives you buoyancy when you’re packrafting on lakes and rivers, and while you’re backpacking it packs to the sizes of a 1 l bottle and weighs a mere 310 g! Developed by the passionate packrafters of the <a href="http://www.packrafting-store.de/index.php?XTCsid=udhrlcr9ija6n1oj3jfmvplou2">Packrafting Store</a> and part of their <a href="http://www.packrafting-store.de/Extras:::19.html">Anfibio line</a> of packrafting accessories, the Buoy Boy is a great way to add safety to your white water and lake adventures off the beaten track, with all the smart details a packrafter wants!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>Eating outdoors: Some prefer plastic bags, other titanium pots, but those who want to eat in style take their <a href="http://www.kupilka.fi/en/products/kupilka-premium">Kupilka Premium Set</a> along. Proper cutlery lets one eat sophisticated with knife, fork and spoon, as well as an dessert spoon for the pudding. A Kupilka 44 plate is great for fish and salad, while the Kupilka 55 bowl is the right choice for soups and stews. One doesn’t need to be thirsty, either: The Kupilka 21 makes a great cup for red wine, coffee and water alike, and for stronger liquids the Kupilka 5 is the right choice. Best of all: After one is done eating &amp; drinking one can rinse the <a href="http://www.kupilka.fi/en/">Kupilka</a> products easily to get them clean - or if you’re in your cottage you can even put them in the dishwasher! A great choice for those who like to cook and feast at home &amp; on the trail - and those tired eating from plastic bags!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>It is not just always backpacking á la backpacking in the forests and hills. Sometimes it is also backpacking á la backpacking from city to town to village, travelling on busses, trains and richa taxis. And for that a durable pack like the <a href="https://www.hanchor.com/products/Travel%20Series/Breccia_Travel_Backpack?locale=en">Breccia Travel Backpack</a> from <a href="https://www.hanchor.com/">HANCHOR</a> is an ideal choice. It has a carry-on size which makes it excellent for an ultralight approach to travelling, and the durable &amp; waterproof construction makes it suitable for backpacking in Central America during the rain season and scrambling in Utah’s canyons in the summer. It can be expanded with modular pockets for any occasion - from a short business city travel trip to a long backpacking tour around the world. It also works great for hiking, carrying climbing gear to the crag or carry photo equipment to the next shoot - a true multi-use beast that is ideal for the ultralight traveller.</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>staying warm in winter - it’s something we Northern people know about. Hailing from Canada <a href="http://arcteryx.com/">Arc’teryx</a> belongs to the illustrious circle of companies which know how to keep alpinists, skiers and backpackers warm when the temperatures drop below 0°C. Their <a href="http://arcteryx.com/product.aspx?language=EN&amp;gender=mens&amp;model=Atom-LT-Hoody">Atom LT Hoody</a> is not just one of their most popular midlayer insulation pieces which is great when cold wind howls through the mountains &amp; tundra, it also works well on its own when it is not freezing cold. Coreloft™ insulation in the torso, arms and hood keep one toasty, and the side panels of Polartec® Power Stretch® with Hardface® Technology add breathability and stretchiness. And when the sun comes out, it packs small and light in the pack - excellent for a winter day out in the hills!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>watching the sun rise in the mountains - is there anything better? Not really. With the new <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=13582&amp;pw=73183&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hyperlitemountaingear.com%2Ffeatured-ultralight-packs%2Fdaybreak-pack.html">Daybreak Pack</a> from <a href="http://bit.ly/1QQRFL2">Hyperlite Mountain Gear</a> I always have all I need along for a day in the hills. It has side pockets for my water bottles, the possibility to attach an ice axe and a back pocket with additional bungees to easily access rain gear or a puffy jacket. Made from Dyneema® Cuben Fiber it takes the abuse of scrambling in the mountains and bushwhacking through the forests, and at 539 g it is so light you can carry it all day long. And if you consider that it’s made in Maine, USA, you know it is a quality piece of gear that is gonna last many, many years!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>with snow on the ground there is no reason to hike or cycle - snow means it is time to ski. And the <a href="http://skinbased.com/5/">WAP 127</a> from <a href="http://www.oacsport.fi">OAC</a> is the perfect tool to ski - from home to the cabin, up the hills and down the slopes. Best thing: I don’t even need to get expensive ski boots, as I can use my normal winter boots thanks to the <a href="http://skinbased.com/10/">OAC EA Binding</a> where I can step in with my winter boots or trailrunners alike and go to the fjells. The patented Unicoat base structure of the WAP 127 allows me to climb steep hills and have great grip on any snow. And at just 1.050 g they’re lighter than many snowshoes - and a lot faster and more fun, too! With these winter will be a lot of fun, so please bring me a pair! </p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>While I’m Opting to be Outside, sometimes litte things are needed to make them more comfortable. Be that a stove to brew a hot cup of tea or a warm beanie, small things make being outside more fun and pleasurable. The focus, however, is always on being outside, and not the gear. Sure you need it, but it’s not the reason to go out. That is to relax, be inspired, spend times with family &amp; good friends and enjoying the beautiful nature. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16888796258/in/album-72157651506091295/" title="Fatbiking over the mires"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7668/16888796258_73067eb837_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Fatbiking over the mires" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>With that said, some warm down gear does help to make cold winter hikes more fun. Damn, even sitting in a wooden hut is made better with some down around your feet. The <a href="https://goosefeetgear.com/products/1-down-socks">Down Socks</a> from Goose Feet Gear not only ensure that toes are toasty, they make it possible to dry my trailrunners by the fire so they’re ready for next days hike. And if you have cold feet in your quilt - these Down Socks ensure you wake up with warm feet!</p>

<p>Also <a href="https://www.blackrockgear.com/product/test/">The Original Black Rock Gear Down Beanie</a> is filled with 950 cuin Hungarian Down and ensures a warm head when the wind is blowing in sub-zero temperatures. Hiking with cold ears is so last year, thus a Black Rock Hat is not only keeping the ears warm but also is <em>trés chic</em>! Did I mention it is ultralight? Of course it is!</p>

<p>Feet and head being cared for, that leaves the hands as the third extremities which tend to not like to much snow, wind and cold. And it just so happens that the <a href="http://www.mountainlaureldesigns.com/shop/product_info.php?cPath=37&amp;products_id=51">Mountain Laurel Designs eVent Mitts</a> are not just excellent to keep the rain of my hands, they also work great in winter! Cold wind and snow won’t trouble you anymore with these ultralight gloves on your hands.</p>

<p>When you do take the gloves off, it often is to boil water for a hot cup of tea. The <a href="https://www.traildesigns.com/stoves/caldera-sidewinder-solo">Caldera Sidewinder Solo</a> is not just a very great stove system, with the 1,1 litre pot you can even boil water for your mates so that everyone has a warm cup of tea! It all packs compactly into the pot and is fuel-efficient, thus a great choice for ultralight outdoor enthusiasts.</p>

<p>That leaves a warm coat for those cold temperatures. Or a toasty pair of trousers. Long underwear. Warm winter shoes. Well, sometimes you’re missing one piece of gear, and that’s where the 50€ Gift Card from <a href="https://www.bergzeit.co.uk/?pid=81/">Bergzeit.co.uk</a> comes in very useful. With it you can save a nice amount of cash on your next big purchase - be that a Merino Baselayer or your new AT skis, Bergzeit.co.uk has it all. </p>

<p>Welcome again to a new Hiking in Finland Advent Calendar! Like in the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/advent-calendar-2013/">years</a> <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/advent-calendar-2014/">before</a>, a good set of rules makes running this a lot easier for everyone involved. Read them carefully and everything will be clear, and check out the <strong>tips</strong> at the end!. </p>

<p>This years calendar will run 25 days (= 25 Doors), and behind each door you will find a fine piece of brand-new gear which should make your next outdoor adventure fun and ultralight. Some information on the prizes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All prizes are sent directly from the company providing them. </li>
  <li>Sometimes it is possible that you can choose size, colour and other variables. Where this is the case, it will be mentioned in the text of the Door.</li>
  <li>This means garments can be either female or male, backpacks can be different torso sizes and meals can be vegetarian or with meat. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-rules">The Rules</h2>

<p>To win something you should check in each day here and enter the raffle. There are a couple of things to keep in mind, though:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>You only can win once. If you don’t win one day, you should try your luck the next day - you got 25 chances!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am using a paid-for version of <a href="https://www.rafflecopter.com/">Rafflecopter</a> for the Give-Aways. With Rafflecopter you can get multiple entries by following someone on Instagram, Twitter, visit a page on Facebook, follow a Pinterest page or susbscribe to a Mailing List. This increases your chances to win, but is not mandatory. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Rafflecopter Widget is integrated with <a href="http://www.random.org/">Random.org</a> and it choses the winner. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once you won, I contact you via the provided Email address and you have 24 hours to reply. If I don’t hear from you, I imagine you don’t want the item and will let Random.org chose a new winner.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Posts go online in the morning around nine-ish, and the raffles close at midnight - Finnish time. Rafflecopter then will show the name of the winner after I pushed that button, this keeps posts to a minimum.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is open to everyone. As in from Australia to Zimbabwe, prices are send everywhere (unless noted otherwise).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Possible Import Duty taxes and fees are paid by the winner. If you’re not willing to pay these, don’t compete. </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>8.. You can’t bribe me or anyone involved to win. You use the item(s) on your own responsibility. Use common sense.</p>

<h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>You can participate via the Rafflecopter widget by registering with your Email or your Facebook accoount. Please make sure for either option that it’s an Email address you regularly check, so when I contact you you get the email. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is usually one mandatory option to answer to participate. This can be something fun or a question about the price in question. You should be easily able to answer the question by reading the text or visiting the manufacturer website. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can get additional entries which improve your chances of winning. This could be visiting a Facebook page or following someone on Twitter, Instagram and the like. It’s a good thing to do, and also allows you stay up-to-date with news about the HiF Advent Calendar and the company sponsoring the prize.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you think your friends and fans would like to participate - spread the word! Use the #HifAdventCalendar hashtag on Instagram, Twitter &amp; Facebook when you spread the word =)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>That’s it. The Advent Calendar starts today, the 23rd of November. Subscribe to the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/atom.xml">RSS feed</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hikinginfinland">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/105082905705272949032">Google+</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/hendrikmorkel">Twitter</a> to get an update every time a new door opens.</p>

<p>We had one objective for our visit to Kaiserwinkl: Do one of the Via Ferrata and shoot some great photos. We got that done on our first afternoon - and now had plenty of time on our hands to do other cool activities. First on our list was packrafting.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22864936066/in/album-72157653403675729/" title="Taking in the view"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5783/22864936066_5e965e21ff_b.jpg" width="1024" height="684" alt="Taking in the view" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="packrafting-on-the-tiroler-ache">Packrafting on the Tiroler Ache</h2>

<p><em>Could I loan your packraft?</em> Vincent asked me before the trip. Sure, no problem. <em>And could you teach me some packrafting, too?</em> Again, no problem, after all I enjoy <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/guided-trips/">teaching packrafting</a>. </p>

<p>We joined <a href="http://ack-koessen.at/?page_id=6">Adventure Club Kaiserwinkl</a> on one of their Adventure Rafting trips, this made transport very easy and I didn’t need to bring paddles or safety gear along. Dressed up in a neoprene suit with a vest and helmet and a paddle we set off to the entry point close to Kössen. The Tiroler Ache is a beautiful river, and the ~7 km section we would packraft would run through deep canyons which have a lot of history - there were smuggler paths in the war through the forests, and a pretty castle stands high above the river. </p>

<p>After some instructions and tips for the packrafting newbie we were off on the fast flowing river, and it was nice that we didn’t need to paddle a lot. The rapids were easy (up to Class II) and especially the Waschmaschine rapid was super fun. Vincent mastered them superbly and it was such a good run that we decided to come back a second time a day later. You could paddle until the Chiemsee in Bavaria, Germany on the Tiroler Ache so there’s plenty of potential for a Microadventure on this river. Wel also met some cool paddlers who were eager to test my packraft, and later shared a beer and some Kanebulla with them at the parking lot =)</p>

<h2 id="canyoning">Canyoning</h2>

<p>We almost didn’t need to take our neoprene suits off before the packrafting - because we were <a href="http://ack-koessen.at/?page_id=14">Canyoning</a> before it! I have been canyoning once before at the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2012/06/adventures-around-lago-didro.html">Lago d’Idro</a> in Italy and loved it. There’s just something very exciting and exhilarating when you enter a deep canyon and know the only way out is following the river down. Jumping over 10 m waterfalls into deep, cold pools sounds crazy - but is so much fun, and definitely a memorable experience. </p>

<p>We drove to a deep canyon with Markus Dagn, our guide from <a href="http://ack-koessen.at">Adventure Club Kaiserwinkl</a> and after a short walk up to the canyon we started with a rappel into the canyon. After Markus pulled the rope there was just one way out: Down the canyon. We jumped into pools, rappelled down waterfalls and slid down smooth rocks that the water has formed over centuries. Far above us was the green roof of the trees and the blue sky, but around us where the dark walls which seemed to be tipping over. After a bit less than an hour and plenty of jumps into cold pools we came out of the canyon, with a big smile on our face. We high-fived each other, rolled the neoprene suits down to let the warm sun on our skin and hiked back to the car. </p>

<h2 id="an-e-mtb-tour-to-the-heuberg">An E-MTB Tour to the Heuberg</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.kaiserwinkl.com/sommer/radsport/e-bikes.html">Electrical Mountain biking</a>. Yes, I was <em>a bit</em> sceptical about this activity. But I also was curious - we have been pondering getting an E-Assisted Cargobike for a while and this would be a good opportunity to see what such an Electric motor on a bike can do. Well, it can do a lot. The 940 m of ascent didn’t make me even break into a sweat, as the E-assist motor is so efficient and powerful that we were just <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/336849079">flying up the trails</a> to the Heuberg. </p>

<p>We picked the Heuberg because it is a scenic, cone-shaped peak and the views from it should be good (they are!). The ride up was fast and also involved some hike-you-e-bike and a short hike without bikes to the summit, and the ride down taught me the lesson that on the downhill it’s smart to put the e-assist off unless you want almost bomb down into the forest. But E-Mountainbikes: There’s no challenge anymore in pedaling up the hill. It doesn’t matter how steep the hill is, as long as you’re able to sit or stand on the bike the motor will pretty much drive you up. Which I enjoyed. But at the same time I wouldn’t do it again. I’d prefer to pedal up with my own power, or then push the bike. If you like it - then you’re in luck: There’s plenty of recharging stations in Kaiserwinkl and it’s part of the largest E-Bike network in the world! There’s ~1.000 km of cycling paths in nine different regions and 45 towns, and loaning an E-MTB is as easy as walking into the <a href="http://www.kaiserwinkl.com/de/sommer/radsport/e-bikes/e-bike-akkuladestation.html">Tourist Information in Walchsee</a>.</p>

<h2 id="via-ferrata">Via Ferrata</h2>

<p>There’s three <a href="http://www.kaiserwinkl.com/en/summer/hiking/climbing.html">Via Ferratas close Walchsee</a>, one beginner VF and two in the D and D/E difficulty. We decided to go for the Bergkameraden Steig. It’s steep at the beginning and has after the bridge some overhanging sections, but after that it gets easier and the descent is going through the nice forest and you come out directly at the Ottenalm Café, where you can grab a coffee and cake to reward yourself for the good climbing you just did! The Via Ferratas all get the afternoon sun and can get hot, so take something to drink along when you go in!</p>

<h2 id="visiting-the-kaiserwinkl">Visiting the Kaiserwinkl</h2>

<p>This was my first visit to the Kaiserwinkl, and I enjoyed it a lot. The highlights definitely were the tasty Kaiserschmarrn at the Fischerwirt, that is an absolute recommendation to go &amp; taste when you visit Walchsee. Also the activities were a lot of fun, with the packrafting and canyoning being the activities I enjoyed the most. Besides these there are plenty more things you can do, from hiking &amp; mountaineering to paragliding and swimming in the lake, Kaiserwinkl offers it all, always with the great view on the Wilder and Zahmer Kaiser mountains. </p>

<p>I travelled to Kaiserwinkl and Walchsee after my visit to <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/11/spring-adventures-in-kronplatz.html">Kronplatz</a>, that was very easy as we just jumped of the train in Kufstein (a beautiful city, by the way) and got a ride with <a href="http://taxikitzbichler.jimdo.com">Taxi Kitzbichler</a> to Walchsee. As Kaiserwinkl is a mere 130 km from the Airport in Munich it’s also possible to hire a car at the airport and drive to Walchsee yourself, though it’s easy enough to get around with public transportation or bikes.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22668169527/in/album-72157653403675729/" title="Walchsee"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5631/22668169527_0fb7f46a1a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Walchsee" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We stayed at the <a href="http://www.bellevue-walchsee.at">Ferienclub Bellevue am Walchsee</a>, which is a rather large hotel and hence has a lot ot offer, especially if you’re going with the family: There’s a large swimming pool inside and outside, a Sauna area, lots of play grounds and a kindergarden when the parents want to relax an afternoon. You can rent bikes and they have good food. Oh, and they’re directly at the Walchsee lake, so fishermen can just jump into a boat and try their luck. </p>

<p>Walchsee is just one of several small villages in the <a href="http://www.kaiserwinkl.com">Kaiserwinkl</a>. It’s small enough that you can walk everywhere, but there’s plenty of nice Cafés, Restaurant and shops that you don’t get bored. And there’s plenty of great outdoor activities available - as you saw above. There’s more photos on Flickr in the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/sets/72157653403675729/">Kaiserwinkl Album</a> to get you in the mood for a visit to this beautiful corner of Tirol!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Would you like a camera that goes from wide angle to super zoom up-close with just one lens for your outdoor adventures? Then look no further than the DMC-FZ1000, Panasonic’s Super Zoom with a super-sweet Leica 25 - 400 mm lens! </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22925198412/in/dateposted/" title="Panasonic DMC-FZ1000 Top Shot"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5643/22925198412_4cfd6c8c07_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Panasonic DMC-FZ1000 Top Shot" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Panasonic suggested I try their new <a href="http://www.panasonic.com/fi/consumer/video-ja-digitaalikamerat/lumix-digitaalikamera-point-shoot/dmc-fz1000ep.html">Lumix DMC-FZ1000</a> Super Zoom camera and see how I liked it for my trips. I was a bit sceptical at first - it’s a big camera for me, lenses can’t be switched and I wasn’t sure if I need a 400 mm long lens. But always curious to try something new, I agreed to take the camera out for a few trips - that was in autumn 2014! It’s been a longer than usual loan, which probably gives you already an idea that I do like to use this camera. And not just I like it, a couple of photographer friends comment that the Leica lens on this camera makes pretty sweet photos with nice colours and contrasts. But from the start.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22925195532/in/dateposted/" title="Panasonic DMC-FZ1000 On"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/637/22925195532_315575d3e5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Panasonic DMC-FZ1000 On" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>As with the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/02/sony-rx100iii-field-report.html">Sony RX 100 III</a>, first a look at my (updated) requirements for a camera:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Print-quality photographs</li>
  <li>High Burst mode and fast Autofocus</li>
  <li>Nightshots possible</li>
  <li>HD Video capable</li>
  <li>Tiltscreen</li>
  <li>Long battery life</li>
  <li>Easy to use</li>
  <li>Lightweight</li>
</ul>

<p>The DMC-FZ1000 weighs with lens shade (23 g), battery (51 g) and SD Card (7 g) 854 g total. Add in your strap of choice and a <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/01/peak-design-capture-pro-camera-clip.html">Peak Design Capture PRO plate</a> and this will be around 900 g for the camera et al. That’s more heavy than other cameras I use, but still lighter than a modern Full-Frame DSLR which often weighs around 1,5 kg with a standard kit lens. Add in a 400 mm lens and you might look at complete weight of over 2,5 kg or more - nearly three times the weight of the Panasonic DMC-FZ1000. Overall I didn’t find the weight a big deal, though it’s bigger than my usual cameras which during transport sometimes is a bit more of a hassle. </p>

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22317481133/in/photostream/" title="Great handling of the Panasonic DMC-FZ1000"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5744/22317481133_581d536d8f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Great handling of the Panasonic DMC-FZ1000" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The handling however is very nice. The shutter button sits comfortably at the front on the protruding hand grip, where also the zoom lever is. The camera zooms fast and the focus is quick. Something I really like is the silent shutter, the camera can take photos completely without noise, which is great if you photograph in nature or do street photography. For a full-on look at the technical details I as usually send you to my colleagues of <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/panasonic-lumix-dmc-fz1000">DP Review</a>, who gave the Panasonic DMC-FZ1000 their Gold Award and loved their 1-inch sensor which <em>produces excellent image quality</em>. Besides the 1 inch sensor I would blame that great image quality also on the superb Leica F2.8-4 lens. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22520264407/in/dateposted/" title="Big lens on the Panasonic DMC-FZ1000"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/745/22520264407_8e7acfe721_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Big lens on the Panasonic DMC-FZ1000" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The results of the lens + sensor + creative photographer means you get stunning images in print-quality. Over the year that I have used the FZ1000 the photos I shot with it have appeared in half a dozen or more magazines. The camera shoots in RAW with the files ending up between 18 and 23 MB in size after converting them to DNG. The battery life is also pretty good, I usually get three to four days of use out of the battery, or around 600+ photos. That high number is likely due to the fact that I rarely review photos on the go or watch photos from the screen.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22939018535/in/dateposted/" title="Photos taken with the DMC-FZ1000 that have made it into magazines"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5657/22939018535_51439dbaab_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Photos taken with the DMC-FZ1000 that have made it into magazines" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22925199962/in/dateposted/" title="Swivel screen on the Panasonic DMC-FZ1000"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/655/22925199962_3c247d62a5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Swivel screen on the Panasonic DMC-FZ1000" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Speaking of the screen, it’s a swivel screen that turns 180° to the front as well as up &amp; down which makes it great for filming yourself, shooting low on the ground or above your head. If you use the screen (which isn’t a touchscreen) or the high resolution XGA electronic viewfinder you have the possibility to let a <em>“water-level”</em> be displayed which shows you if your frame is aligned evenly to the horizon. I found this at the beginning a bit annoying, but as I often take photos on the go I started to like this feature quite a bit and found it very useful. Unless I was shooting from above my head or low on the ground I was by the way using the EVF which I found very comfortable. It has a large eye-piece which blocks out the outside light fairly well, and the small screen is high in contrast and is also easy to check or review a frame from. </p>

<p>Around the big lens there’s a very nice focus/ zoom ring which is easy to use if you’re into manual zooming/ focussing. I myself prefer the lever and using the cursors to set focus points and let the camera get it, but if you want to be more hands-on I can see how this might be useful. The lens also has an Imaging Stabilizator which can be switched on and off and comes in handy if you’re shooting at 400 mm handheld. </p>

<p>A feature which I really like is the Timelapse function. For some of my work it is important to be myself in the photo, and as I didn’t want to buy a remote for the FZ1000 and didn’t want (or could, as I was shooting myself packrafting) run to the camera for the self timer the Timelapse function is a great feature. You can set in-camera the amount of photos the camera should take as well as the time between shots - say take 200 photos, each 5 seconds apart. The FZ1000 then either assembles the images in-camera into a timelapse movie and saving you a work step on the computer, or you can just let it save the photos separately. Either way, it’s a great feature that I find very useful - both for photography and making Timelapse movies.</p>

<p>So lets look at some of my other requirements and see how the DMC-FZ1000 performs there:</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/21836572460/in/album-72157645805765757/" title="Aurora Borealis"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/656/21836572460_c48aab5ce1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Aurora Borealis" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Nightshots possible ✓</p>

<p>Once you figured out the settings it is surprisingly easy to take beautiful photos of the stars and aurora borealis, as the above photo shows. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15877047812/in/album-72157647589227685/" title="Christoph trying Godspeed, 7c, Dyno"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7478/15877047812_70a9fb2bc2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Christoph trying Godspeed, 7c, Dyno" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>High Burst mode and fast Autofocus ✓</p>

<p>The FZ1000 can shoot 12 frames per second (fps) which is great for sports photography. The Autofocus is snappy and fast which means you end up with more usable shoots to pick your frame from. </p>

<iframe width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zugVQS52VPA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>HD Video capable ✓</p>

<p>Press the red button on the top of the camera and you start filming, or switch the dial to the Manual Movie mode to have some more control over the settings. The output in HD is crisp and beautiful with superb Stereo sound, and you can take photos while filming without interrupting the movie. The FZ1000 can record 4k Video at 100Mbps so if you’re dealing in high-quality video this camera is ready for it. If you want an <a href="http://amzn.to/1MA5xqg">external Microphone</a> - you’re in luck, that also can be attached to the Hotshoe and has a jack on the left side. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15909703263/in/album-72157645805765757/" title="Winter Bliss"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8641/15909703263_1634276c02_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Winter Bliss" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>So what are the short-comings for an outdoor photographer with the DMC-FZ1000? Well, it is chunky. Chunky and big like a DSLR, although that allows for a good handling. I also would have wished that it would have had a constant maximum aperture, and maybe that it would have had a Bulb function and be compatible with my <a href="http://amzn.to/1WMuDZE">Pixel Wireless Shutter Remote</a>. The list is pretty short, because the FZ1000 has a lot of good sides. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15692018457/in/album-72157647589227685/" title="Sunset"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8631/15692018457_b91eed1fa6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Sunset" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="the-bottomline">The Bottomline</h2>

<p>The Panasonic DMC-FZ1000 has a lot speaking for it: Great images out of the camera, 4k Video, an awesome Timelapse function, the superb Leica 25 - 400 mm lens with f2.8 to 4 and a very intuitive and easy handling. Yes, it is a bit more heavy and bulky in comparison to other system cameras, but if you want a large focal length spectrum without carrying a couple of lenses then the FZ1000 quickly is lighter than a system with comparable lenses. The Autofocus is very fast &amp; reliable which is great if you photography sports or kids. Did I already mention the beautiful photos it makes? Well, it does make very good photos with vivid colours which can be printed in large sizes. If you want a camera quiver of one and don’t want to deal with carrying more lenses for different lengths, the Lumix DMC-FZ1000 is worth a look. </p>
