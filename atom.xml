    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ski-touring, that’s walking - skinning in skiing terms - the mountain up and then skiing it down. It’s a great way to enjoy the mountains in winter and has similarities to hiking. But much unlike the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/gear-reviews/">light trailrunners</a> I use from spring till autumn, in winter you need a ski boot. Happily I found after much research &amp; pondering a boot which is light and performs great on the way up &amp; down.</p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>I bought the Spectre after much research last November from the Bergfreunde, and have used it ski-touring in Canada, Finland, Austria, Switzerland and South Tyrol since, all in all over 20 days. It coming along to Lyngen next week, too!</p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>A ski-touring boot has two modes: A Walk mode for skinning up the mountain and a ski-mode to come down again. The walk mode gives you freedom of movement for sliding the ski forward while you skin up, and the ski mode makes the boot stiff so you can transfer your power onto the binding and ski.  Normal Alpine Skiing boots miss the walk feature, and while you might be able to skin up short sections for serious ascents you want a <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/tourenskischuhe/">ski boot</a> with a walk mode. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25184029286/in/album-72157664166747400/" title="At the start of the ski-tour"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1495/25184029286_5212fe5fdc_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="At the start of the ski-tour" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>As told by La Sportiva, the Spectre comes with these features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>4 Buckles plus optional Power Strap</li>
  <li>60° Range of Motion</li>
  <li>120 Flex</li>
  <li>3 preset Forward Lean options: 10°, 14° and 18°</li>
  <li>Tech and AT Bindings compatible</li>
  <li>Dynafit inserts</li>
  <li>Rockered Vibram Sole</li>
  <li>Carbon Reinforced Grilamid Vertebra</li>
  <li>Marfram Spoiler</li>
  <li>Pebax Cuff</li>
  <li>Grilamid Shell</li>
  <li>Sole length xxx mm in MP 26.5</li>
  <li>Dual Density EZ Thermo liner</li>
  <li>And it is Made in Italy</li>
</ul>

<p>In the box you’ll find besides the boots two optional laces which allow you to get a tighter fit of the liner on your foot, two insoles, a few patches and tools.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26149575060/in/album-72157666988623142/" title="The La Sportiva Spectres"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1549/26149575060_5387ff101d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="776" alt="The La Sportiva Spectres" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>The Pegasus Buckles, which are flat when open which means they don’t snag on stuff close to your feet, and can comfortably be worn underneath your pants, are great. The buckles on my other ski-touring boot don’t lay flat so these are definitely more convenient in use. Additionally you can Micro-adjust the buckles for a perfect fit. The very low weight for a four-buckle boot is also a great achievement by La Sportiva.</p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>I haven’t been easy on the boots, and they have flown several thousands of miles across the globe in my <a href="https://www.bergzeit.de/douchebag-the-douchebag-skitasche-pitch-black/?pid=81">Douchebag</a>, skied and skinned thousands of meters, climbed ice in them and walked through town in them, and they still look good and only have minor scratches.</p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>My Size 26.5 Spectres weigh with liner 1374 g, that’s 240 g for the liner boot and 1134 g for the shell. The <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/12/arcteryx-procline-carbon-lite-ski-boot.html">Arc’teryx Procline Carbon Lite Ski Boot</a> is lighter, but I haven’t used it yet.</p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p><em>My experience is based on skiing the Spectre with <a href="http://bit.ly/22PDNaU">DPS Wailer 99 Tour1 Skis</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/20DPCfk">G3 ION 12 Bindings</a>.</em></p>

<p>There’s plenty of opinions on the Spectre - from people that really dislike the boot to ones that love it, and everything in between. There’s two things why I don’t love the boot outright: And that are the two blisters on my feet. After hiking in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2013/10/inov-8-trailroc-235.html">Trailrunners</a> for over seven years, climbing in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/01/scarpa-rebel-ultra-gtx.html">Mountaineering boots</a> for four and <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2011/01/backcountry-cross-country-skiing.html">XC skiing</a> in good boots since six years I haven’t had blisters anymore. But on my second ski-touring trip this year to <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/02/ski-touring-south-tyrol-and-salzburger-lungau.html">South Tyrol</a> and Salzburger Lungau, on the second day blisters appeared on the inside of my ankles. Compeed helped in allowing me to ski the next few weeks, but even after the blister healed they were there again after a day of skiing on the next trip. Blisters are no fun, and while I happily bite my teeth together and continue to wear the boots I think I either will need to go with them to a good boot fitter (which, sadly, we don’t have in Vaasa) or try my hand at modifying the boot on my own; and as it is made from Grilamid which tends to hold its shape once punched (unlike Pebax, another plastic which is often used in the construction of ski boots) that might be a good option too. These problems came after moulding the liner twice and the shell once, by the way. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26149572410/in/album-72157666988623142/" title="Liner &amp; insole"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1650/26149572410_5f4caf3e9f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Liner &amp; insole" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Getting into the boot is easy for me, I have narrow feet and wear medium-thickness to thin skiing socks, and the shell has a medium to narrow heel fit, a narrow instep and has a medium forefoot last. The top buckles can be moved out of the way for easily getting in (and out) of the boot. After a day of touring getting out of the boot needs a bit of pulling - nothing difficult, though, and if I open all buckles it’s super-simple to get out. It’s recommended to play around with the boot and find the right adjustments for your style of skiing, and as the Spectre allows a host of possibilities to adjust it to your foot &amp; style - take the time to do it, you will have more fun in the long-run. Stepping in to the pin-binding of your choice is easy thanks to the two indicators on each side of the boot, these make it easy to align the boot with the pins and then push down so they snap into the fittings.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26422447775/in/album-72157666988623142/" title="Aligned"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1553/26422447775_1186807e11_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Aligned" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Other reviewers seem to take issues with the buckles. Yes, they’re different: You can micro-adjust them to your needs via the screw, and it takes some learning to get the hole placed over the stud - and it won’t snap over it unless you get the alignment correctly. I didn’t have any issues with them and found the system easy, and you can even adjust the buckles when you’re in the boot. I really liked the low profile buckle design which fits perfectly under the ski pants and does provide a cleaner profile &amp; prevents trees, rocks and stuff from catching the buckles, which protects them from being damaged and makes them last longer.</p>

<p>The Liner is warm and I never had cold feet in them. I needed to add the included lacing for them to move less on my foot while touring. It has a flex zone that helps in touring mode. The two loops at the front and back make it easy to pull the boot on. The liner keeps your sweaty feet smell well, so if you’re a connoisseur of such things you’re in luck. Otherwise you might want to dry and air them well before taking them in. </p>

<p>The sticky rubber sole is great and allows for great grip when scrambling or walking in town and slippery ski stations. The yellow areas at the toe and heel are more durable, and the higher arch minimizes snow-build-up in my experience. The Spectre is crampons compatible and my <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/camp-xlc-470-steigeisen/">CAMP XLC Crampons</a> are a great companion with them and make for an ultralight ski-mountaineering setup.</p>

<p>Alright, so getting in the boot is all swell, skinning up is great because the boot is light with a great range of motion, but what about switching into ski mode at the wind-blasted summit and the descent? I’m happy to report that it takes only a minute, it at all, to close all buckles and switch the boot into ski mode and if you have a wide ski pants you can even do it while the pants and snow-gaiter are down over the buckles (I have been using a <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/norroena-lyngen-driflex3-pants-hardshellhose/">Norrøna Lyngen softshell pants</a> and a <a href="http://www.arcteryx.com/product.aspx?language=EN&amp;gender=mens&amp;collection=Whiteline&amp;model=Stinger-Pant">Arc’teryx Stinger Pants</a> which both allowed to do this). Fussing around with boots at a windy &amp; cold summit is no fun, even less if you need to take the gloves off, and with the Spectre I was quickly ready to ski down. </p>

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26149582890/in/album-72157666988623142/" title="Lean back"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1467/26149582890_7fb38ed8d6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Lean back" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I found the Spectre a stiff boot when tightly buckled down for the descent, and find it has good control and power transmission that could easily control my fat DPS Wailers on almost all snow conditions (hard, icy slopes in resorts are tough and my skis started flutter, but that’s another story). Buckled down the boot still had plenty of room in the toe box for warm toes, I haven’t experienced any shin bang which I thank the Booster Strap for, and the black EZ Flex area on the tongue gives a nice flex in downhill mode. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25817614954/in/album-72157666988623142/" title="Open!"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1592/25817614954_1d2f98d371_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Open!" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Some 20+ days are not really yet enough to give a comment on durability, so I will save that for a later time. But what’s worth discussing is the price of the Spectre. If you have read till here you might think that such a lightweight, innovative boot probably must cost a little fortune. Well, it does not. The regular, recommended price is around 490€ - but thanks to never-ending sales you can pick up the Spectre for as little as 370€. Even at the recommended price it’s an affordable ski boot, and if you can get it with a discount it is a lot cheaper than many other boots.</p>

<h2 id="could-be-better">Could be better</h2>

<p>La Sportiva decided to update the Spectre for 2016/ 2017, which should address some of the issues described above and allow for even more customization. Even if I try hard, I can not imagine something to complain about this boot - I think the blisters are something that just happened and because I want to keep these boot it is something I need to find a way to solve &amp; life with.</p>

<h2 id="competing-products">Competing Products</h2>

<p>There’s a wide variety of <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/tourenskischuhe/">ski-touring boot</a> available, I myself also own the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/marken/scarpa/tourenskischuhe/">Scarpa Maestrale RS</a>, and many people like the <a href="https://www.bergfreunde.de/dynafit-tlt-6-mountain-cr-tourenskischuhe/">Dynafit TLT 6</a>. In the end you should follow my final advice in the bottomline when it comes to buying boots.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26356257591/in/album-72157666988623142/" title="Spectre"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1505/26356257591_719db2aea1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Spectre" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>I decided the buy the Spectre because it is the lightest four buckle boot and would allow me an easier time on the way up - where I’d need to move the 1374 g per foot hundreds of times - and great control on the way down. So far it has performed great, and aside from the blisters which I hope to solve with some punches on the shell I imagine the boot will accompany for the next few ski-touring seasons. The Spectre is comfortable &amp; light on the way up and performs great on the way down, especially in powder. I love the low buckle design as they fit very well under my ski pants, the comfortable walking in town, and the cool look of the boot is also something I don’t get tired of. The light weight also make them good for climbing, be it rock or ice. Add in the amazing price and you have a boot which I am very happy with!</p>

<p><em>But the ultimate Bottomline for ski-boots is simple: If the boot fits and is comfortable, buy it. You might have the luck that your feet fit the Spectre out of the box, or they might not suit you at all - the general wisdom for ski boots is to buy a boot that fits you well, because everything else might end up in pain.</em></p>

<p>Check the over 40 detailed photos of the boot from all angles on the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/albums/72157666988623142">La Sportiva Spectre Album</a>. </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You like to go outdoors and love a tricked out van or off-road vehicle to get there? Then <em>Off the Road</em> is the book for you - but careful, you might want to sell your house and move into a van!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26210796662/in/dateposted/" title="Off the Road Cover"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1665/26210796662_6361a93f26_b.jpg" width="1024" height="1024" alt="Off the Road Cover" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I don’t have a driving license. We don’t own a car. And yet I like the idea of living in a van or tricked-out off-road vehicle. Hence <a href="http://shop.gestalten.com/off-the-road.html">Off the Road</a> is such an appealing book. On over 250 pages and even more photos you get inspiration for your own #VanLife. Are you an BMW Enduro kind of guy, or an VW T4 aficionado? Does your heart beat for adventure off the beaten track in a Toyota Land Cruiser or do you prefer to have an adventure-ready trailer behind your car? This book illuminates people from all these roads &amp; more, with inspiring stories of people who rode from the most southern point in Florida to the most northerly point in Alaska or who crossed Russia from the west to the east. </p>

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/144480827?byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>But it has not only such adventurous expeditions in it, also more achievable #VanLife stories are in the book - things you can realize at the weekend or during your summer holidays. Like going to the beach with your trailer for a lonely weekend at the sea, or taking your van with the surfboards on top for a trip to search the best waves. There’s a bunch of vans, cars, trailers, motorcycles and off-road vehicle depicted in the book, complete with technical information and how to make them even more off-road worthy for your next big (or small) trip. Inspiration for how to renovate the interior of your van, why an Unimog still is one of the greatest All-terrain vehicles, and how you can transform your van into a mobile office which allows you from anywhere. </p>

<p>And the appeal also comes through to me, who is generally opposed to motorized outdoor activities. I could imagine trading the house for a small van, drive around the world and have a new view to wake up to each morning. Where I can sit in front of the car and drink a coffee, sit by the camp fire and watch the stars before going laying down on a comfortable bed, and which would allow me to just put on the skis in the morning and skin up a mountain. Of course I’d first need to get a driving license to do that =) But if you have one, and it sounds like a good life to you, pick up this book and be inspired by what is possible. Great photos and stories most likely will make you think if you really need a house, or if a nice off-road vehicle or van wouldn’t suffice for a life off the road!</p>

<h2 id="hetta">Hetta</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.tosilappi.fi">Hetta</a> is in the far, far north of Finland and that means: Lots of snow, crispy cold temperatures, Northern Lights and beautiful sunny days in spring. Last year we spent our winter holiday in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/04/winter-family-adventures-in-pyha-luosto.html">Pyhä</a> and this year we decided to visit another small and family-friendly town: Hetta. Right in the heart of Lapland it is located at the top of the <a href="http://www.nationalparks.fi/pallas-yllastunturinp">Pallas-Yllästunturi National Park</a> and the starting point of the <a href="http://www.nationalparks.fi/hettapallashikingtrail">Hetta-Pallas Trail</a> which you can ski in winter or hike in the summer. <a href="http://www.nationalparks.fi/poyrisjarvi">Pöyrisjärvi Wilderness Area</a> and <a href="http://www.nationalparks.fi/tarvantovaara">Tarvantovaara Wilderness Area</a> are right around the corner, and it isn’t far to Norway, either - which makes it an ideal base camp for outdoor and nature lovers in summer &amp; winter.</p>

<p>It has all that a winter enthusiast needs: Cafés &amp; <a href="http://www.tosilappi.fi/en/services/restaurants/">Restaurants</a>, various <a href="http://www.tosilappi.fi/en/accommodation/">accommodation options</a>, a supermarket and various other shops, the <a href="http://www.nationalparks.fi/felllaplandvisitorcentre">Fell Lapland Visitor Centre</a> and lots of stuff to do, from skiing on the local hill to enjoying the silence on a Husky Sled ride. With six days in Hetta we had plenty of time to try various <a href="http://www.tosilappi.fi/en/things-to-do/winter/">activities</a> and experience what the town has to offer.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25546943983/in/album-72157665518007630/" title="Sunshine!"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1646/25546943983_f5b7a882b6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Sunshine!" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="outside-with-hetta-huskies">Outside with Hetta Huskies</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.hettahuskies.com/en">Hetta Huskies</a> are probably one of the most well-known companies from Hetta, and if you meet the dogs, owners and Guides it is clear why: The dogs are lovely and will make your trip unforgettable, while the owners Pasi &amp; Anna with their friendly, international staff of Guides will ensure you have a great experience - be it just a few hours or a week!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/26122490546/in/album-72157665518007630/" title="Hetta Huskies"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1550/26122490546_2d432ac709_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Hetta Huskies" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We were with the whole family - my four year old son, baby, wife and me - on the <a href="http://www.hettahuskies.com/en/activities/single-day-safaris">Silent Landscapes</a> Safari, in which you get a tour of the Farm, meet the dogs, get instructed on how to ride the sleigh and then are off into the winter wonderland for around 45 minutes. It’s was a great and interesting experience that we all enjoyed, especially our son thought it was a lot of fun (the baby slept!). We were accompanied by a guide who stayed mostly away but helped when the need arose - we had a small change in the configuration of dogs, for example. After I got instructed in riding the sleigh the family sat down and then we were off to the mires. I always love to explore swamps in winter, their vast area and wide views are beautiful to behold and in winter you can explore them without mosquitos and wet feet. We could see the distant fjells of the National Park, rode through the forest and loved the silence of nature. We could have gone much longer - and the dogs, too! - but after 45 minutes we were back at the farm where we helped bringing the dogs back to their compounds and said thanks for their great service!</p>

<h2 id="a-visit-to-the-hetta-snow-castle">A visit to the Hetta Snow Castle</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.nakkala.com">Näkkälä Eräpalvelut</a> offers visits to their Snow Castle which is a short 20 minute snowmobile ride over the frozen lake away from Hetta. The castle is open from the end of November and still stands there in the end of June and with walls several meters thick that’s no surprise! The kids loved it and it is easy to understand why they were fascinated by the ice castle: Consisting of three domed rooms they were adorned with ice sculptures, an ice bar and tables as well as a frozen bed! You can sleep in the ice castle, too! After exploring the snow castle for a while we had hot juice and then it was again back to Hetta in the sleigh. A great activity for the morning or afternoon after which you might find yourself again outside trying to build your own snow igloo!</p>

<h2 id="skiing-at-hetta-hiihtomaa">Skiing at Hetta Hiihtomaa</h2>

<p>If you <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hendrikm/">follow me on Instagram</a> you probably have realized that I have been ski-touring a lot this winter. <a href="http://www.hettahiihtomaa.fi">Hetta Hiihtomaa</a> is the local skiing hill and we took the chance for our son to learn a bit of skiing and I too took a ride in the lift up to go down through the snow-covered forest. The service at Hetta Hiihtomaa was superb, the two Gentlemen were super-friendly and helpful with <a href="http://www.hettahiihtomaa.fi/p/valinevuokraus.html">loaning the gear</a> and sharing local knowledge. Besides the lift and ski-rental there’s also a Café, a big sledding hill and a illuminated XC Loipe. The prizes are very affordable when compared to the large ski areas, and the people and kids all had a lot of fun on the slopes or off-piste. Hetta Hiihtomaa has also a small beginner’s hill which is excellent for learning to ski, and I can totally recommend the sledding hill, too! </p>

<h2 id="ski-touring-into-the-white--out-at-nkklvaara">Ski-touring into the White (-Out) at Näkkälävaara</h2>

<p>What I like more than skiing at a resort is going into the backcountry, and I was fortunate enough to go out for a morning with Riikka from <a href="http://www.wildriver.fi">Wild River Nature Adventures</a>. We decided it’d be a good idea to go to Näkkälä, a tiny village some 30 minutes from Hetta, where we’d tour up to the local fjell, Näkkälävaara. It’s an easy tour with a really cool descent through a birch forest and I had a huge smile on my face after the cool run down! </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25546895203/in/album-72157665518007630/" title="Yay!"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1464/25546895203_30c25d623d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Yay!" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>We started next to one of the few houses and then toured over a narrow lake to the foot of the fjell. It was a cold day and a mist was hanging in the air, which would before long engulf us as we started the climb up the hill. The visibility was soon just a couple dozen metre, and first as we were starting the descent the weather cleared a bit to give a few views price. Nevertheless it was beautiful to tour through the white landscape, with trees hidden under thick covers of snow &amp; ice, arctic hare tracks running across the hill and the wind being the only sound wide &amp; far. At the summit we waited for half an hour for the weather to clear, as you could see till Pyhäkero to the south and the mountains in Norway to the north, as well as the large Pöyrisjärvi lake. Alas, they stayed all hidden! </p>

<p>After the superb descent we skied along the lake, past the rental cabins of <a href="http://www.nakkala.com/kampat/">Näkkälä Eräpalvelut</a> and to a sacred rock of the Sami, which showed ancient reindeer paintings. Too soon we were back at the car and on our way back to Hetta, where we encountered many reindeer next to the road - and the sun also came out! There’s plenty of great ski-touring around Hetta, from the majestic Pyhäkero to smaller fjells in the area. Grab a map and go out explore!</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.hetan-majatalo.fi/en">Hotel Hetan Majatalo</a> has every Friday a Lappish Buffet which is super-tasty. Reindeer, salmon, mashed potatoes and a tasty dessert along with a great home-brewed beer it is something you should treat yourself to. </p>

<p>Also the buffet at the Lapland Hotel Hetta was very tasty, with a wide variety of salads for startes, wish and meat mains and several sweet desserts. Add in a good selection of wines and beers with great service and you have a great evening!</p>

<h2 id="enjoying-the-silence-of-xc-skiing">Enjoying the silence of XC skiing</h2>

<p>As we stayed in a cottage next to the lake and there’s around 100 km of skiing tracks (here’s the <a href="http://www.tosilappi.fi/wp-content/uploads/Hetan-alueen-latukartta.pdf">map</a>) going XC skiing is something that you can do any time of the day - even at night, as there’s illuminated tracks, too! I took my son in a Pulka for a few hours of skiing along, which is a great way to be outdoors. XC skiing is relatively easy, you go at a low speed and thus still can experience the nature around you but it’s fast enough to feel good after a few hours outside. </p>

<h2 id="learning-about-sami-culture-at-the-fell-lapland-visitor-centre">Learning about Sami Culture at the Fell Lapland Visitor Centre</h2>

<p>If the weather is so bad that you don’t want to be outside, head to the wonderful <a href="http://www.nationalparks.fi/en/felllaplandvisitorcentre">Fell Lapland Visitor Centre</a>. It’s open every day of the week, has also a Café with tasty cakes and pastries and the exhibitions are free of charge - hence an ideal way to spend an afternoon. There’s even a very nice children’s corner which our son enjoyed playing at! The main exhibition shows the eight seasons of the Sámi and how their life has changed over the time. To take it all in a couple of hours would be needed I reckon, though it is easy to spend even more time there to also explore the small library and the two other exhibitions.</p>

<h2 id="more-things-to-see--do">More things to see &amp; do</h2>

<p>Hetta has many other things to offer, from festivals like the Nordic Ice &amp; Snow Sculpture competition at the end of February over regular Nature evenings in the Museum to the <a href="http://saamiskirace.fi">Saami Ski Race</a> in April. You can view the <a href="http://www.tosilappi.fi/en/events/">events</a> here. There’s also two silver smiths in Hetta which are worth checking out and a church which is architecturally interesting. It’s not far to Kilpisjärvi, either, or you could go for a day trip over to Alta in Norway. If you’re looking for a few days in nature you could ski from Pallas to Hetta through the fjells (or vice versa) and you even can ski onwards to Näkkälä. </p>

<p><strong>Where to stay?</strong></p>

<p>We stayed at the <a href="http://www.tosilappi.fi/en/ounistieva-en/">Ounistieva Cottage</a> which is a nice cottage a bit out of town right next to the lake. It’s a self-service cottage with a nice wood-heated sauna, a warm wood stove and you can go XC skiing from the doorstep, which is awesome. Cottages are great for families as you can be as loud as you want, the kids can play safely outside in the snow and there’s plenty of space inside. If you prefer something more central then we can recommend the <a href="http://www.hetan-majatalo.fi">Hotel Hetan Majatalo</a> and the <a href="https://www.laplandhotels.com/EN/hotels-in-lapland/hetta/lapland-hotel-hetta.html">Lapland Hotel Hetta</a> which are close to the centre of town and also have their own Restaurants with great food. Their rooms, especially in the Hetan Majatalo, are very cozy and it’s nice to have breakfast &amp; dinner served each evening. There’s several more <a href="http://www.tosilappi.fi/en/accommodation/">accommodation options in Hetta</a> for every budget, so have a look around and find what suits you!</p>

<p><strong>How to get there?</strong></p>

<p>We travelled with a combination of <a href="https://www.vr.fi/cs/vr/fi/etusivu">train</a> and <a href="https://www.sixt.fi">car</a> instead of driving all the way up north, with a night in Rovaniemi on the way up and down - if you have small kids it is more comfortable this way, for everyone really. In the train the kids can play, nap and go easily to the toilet, and the ride from Rovaniemi to Hetta takes only around four hours by car - much better than the 12+ hours of driving it would take from Vaasa! And if you come from abroad - just fly straight to <a href="https://www.finavia.fi/en/enontekio/">Enontekiö Airport</a>! </p>

<p>Winter, also known to parents as the time where you need to get ready 15 minutes before you plan to leave - because your little ones need help dressing up in the multitude of layers we make them wear so they do not get cold. Because only when they’re not cold they actually enjoy being outdoors (much like adults, really). We tested the <a href="https://marmot.com/products/details/boys-space-walk-jacket">Marmot Space Walk Jacket</a> and <a href="https://marmot.com/products/details/boys-edge-insulated-pant">Edge Insulated Pants</a> during the last four months outside while alpine skiing, sledding, building snowmen and XC skiing, and here are our thoughts about them.</p>

<h2 id="space-walk-jacket">Space Walk Jacket</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.marmot.de/content/de/collection_26&amp;c=643&amp;show=5778">Space Walk Jacket</a> in Size XS equals size 110 and weighs 512 g. Our son loved the colour combination of orange and reds, and we too really liked it. Outside a waterproof &amp; breathable Marmot MemBrain® Fabric keeps snow and moisture at bay, while on the inside a Thermal R 100 g insulation ensures generated warmth stays inside. The hood is removable, and a really good fit, even over a bobble hat. The Powder Skirt keeps the snow out and is extremely useful for little skiers and playing in the snow. It has a silicone band on the inside which keeps it in place and has two levels of tightness. In the back, chin and neck a fleece lining makes it comfortable against the skin and likely helps with breathability, too. What we found overkill were the six pockets, we could have done easily with only the one large mesh pocket on the inside (which is great to store beanie, neck warmer and gloves!) and one of the outside pockets. Our son never used the Velcro hand pockets nor the other two pockets on the outside. The hem is adjustable, though with the toggles in the pockets it is difficult to do so - happily we never needed it. The sleeves have Velcro closures and also can be adjusted, and most importantly are wide enough so gloves can be worn underneath the sleeves to keep the snow out. The jacket closes high and our son found the area in the front of the face constricting, something we solved by leaving the zipper always a couple of centimetre open.</p>

<p>In terms of warmth, we feel the jacket (and pants for that matter) are warm till -10°C with a thin midlayer on (plus normal clothes), probably more with a thicker midlayer. The jacket has plenty of space underneath for layering, and our son never was cold in a variety of activities and weather conditions. It gives little skiers and climbers great freedom of movement, and the Powder Skirt ensures no cold and wet snow comes inside. After four months of use and a couple of washes the jacket also still looks like new, also at high-stress areas like the cuffs and back. Overall our son really liked his Space Walk Jacket - it is warm, has nice colours and is easy for him to put on and off on his own. </p>

<h2 id="edge-insulated-pants">Edge Insulated Pants</h2>

<p>In size XS the <a href="http://www.marmot.de/content/de/collection_26&amp;c=647&amp;show=5792">Edge Insulated Pants</a> weighs 444 g. They are, as the name suggests, insulated pants, made of the proprietary Marmot MemBrain® fabric on the outside which makes the pants water-resistant, while on the inside a Thermal R™ insulation keeps little winter lovers warm. We found the internal flex boot gaiters great to keep shoes &amp; socks dry from the inside, and the reinforced inside leg is useful for skiing as well as scrambling on rocks. The waist is adjustable via Velcros on the inside, but sadly the adjustment is only minimal - we feel a bit more adjustment in width or a stretchy waist could have been better and would possibly make it possible to use the pants two winter seasons. The removable suspenders are great, and the soft inside lining makes it easy to put the pants on over other pants. We never used the three pockets on the pants, so maybe it’d make sense to get rid of at least the two zippered pockets. </p>

<p>Putting the pants on is easy thanks to the smooth lining and it stays well in place with the adjustable suspenders and button closure. After four months of daily use outside the Edge Insulated Pants still looks like new after a couple of washes. The Marmot MemBrain® fabric kept the snow &amp; wetness always reliable outside and it was easy to brush dirt off the pants. They allow for great freedom of movement, be it scrambling up the snow hills along the streets, climbing on the playground or Alpine and XC skiing. The sizing is good for kids between 108 and 112 cm, though if your child is wearing more than one baselayer the waist might get tight (we just left the button open). Asides from these little things from us parents our son simply liked his Edge Insulated Pants a lot: They were toasty, allowed him to go sledding on his pants down steep snow hills and also looked cool!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In late February and early March I made a visit to Switzerland to attempt the Graubünden Haute Route. Sadly the high avalanche danger and changing weather cut us short - here’s a first taste of four days ski-touring in Graubünden.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25455047716/in/album-72157665020355632/" title="Going down."><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1445/25455047716_5a5b16aa20_b.jpg" width="1024" height="684" alt="Going down." /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.hauteroute-graubuenden.ch">Graubünden Haute Route</a> is a five days/ four nights ski-touring trip where you visit four beautiful huts, ski great powder, test your mountaineering skills while climbing some beautiful peaks and enjoy great scenary. Well, that’s at least the normal plan, but because of not really good weather and high avalanche danger our trip was cut a wee bit short. Stay tuned for a full day-to-day account of my Haute Route experience, but for now enjoy these fine selection of photos! </p>

<p>Day one we skied from Madulain to the D’Es-Cha Hut, where we spent in the end two nights because we didn’t want to risk our lives in highly dangerous avalanche terrain. It’s a beautiful hut with great wardens, a wide selection of board and card games as well as interesting magazines - so we didn’t get bored while waiting for better weather.</p>

<p>In the end we skied back to Madulain, took the loveley UNESCO World Heritage train to Bergün and took the long way up to the Kesch Hut.</p>

<p>Reto, the warden, welcomed us in heinous winds to his hut with a very taste cup of hot, sweet tea. His wife Ursina cooked us a delicious dinner and we slept great - ready for our fourth day, with high hopes of better weather yet again.</p>

<p>I have been writing for <a href="http://www.norrmagazin.de">NORR</a> on and off since five years and was really happy as they asked me to help them create the Special issue within the magazine on Finland.

<p>I like an active start to my days, so whenever possible I like to get up before dawn and head out to watch the sun rise outside. In winter this is easier because the sun doesn’t rise until 9 o’clock or later, but of course it is a lot colder outside - like on this morning, where it was -19°C outside when I took my Fatbike to watch the sun rise out on a frozen lake: </p>

<p>As I skip breakfast in the mornings to not wake up the kids I usually just fill up one of my bottles with some tasty juice, as it gives more energy than plain water and does taste better - coffee and a smoothie I enjoy then when I’m back home after a nice morning ride and lots of motivation for my work day! </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Remember your roots,</strong> they say. Our roots are in ultralight backpacking. We have spread the gospel about ultralight backpacking since a long time, have <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/interviews/">interviewed cottage manufacturers</a> and used a lot of ultralight kit on our hikes and treks. And even when I nowadays am attending the big outdoor trade fairs like <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/02/ispo-2016-news-iii.html">ISPO</a> and <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/outdoor-fair-2015/">OutDoor</a>, it’s the new gear from the cottages that I am most excited about. And so <a href="http://hrxxlight.com">Benjamin</a> and me again set out to ask Cottage Manufacturers about the new gear they have been developing, prototyping and testing in the last months and are now ready to release to you. So here we are, and we wish you a lot of fun checking out the <strong>New Gear from the Cottages 2016</strong>!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/13912268942/in/album-72157644166894052/" title="MLD TrailStar in the English Lake District."><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2900/13912268942_8066e0cef6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="MLD TrailStar in the English Lake District." /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><em>Disclaimer: The information in this article are directly from the cottages. I haven’t seen nor tested this equipment, it rather is a showcase of all the new gear the cottages have been developing over the last months and year. I’m not paid for it, if you like it <a href="http://bit.ly/1HGCWMS">buy me a coffee or two</a>.</em></p>

<p><em>You have a cottage and should be on this list with your new gear? <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#104;&#101;&#110;&#100;&#114;&#105;&#107;&#064;&#104;&#105;&#107;&#105;&#110;&#103;&#105;&#110;&#102;&#105;&#110;&#108;&#097;&#110;&#100;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;">Email me</a> and I’ll add you!</em></p>

<h2 id="tschum">Tschum</h2>

<p><a href="https://tschum.de">Tschum</a> is the name of the traditional housings of some Siberian natives, similar to the Lávvu and the Kota, and the name of Germany’s newest cottage. Born from the owners wish for a small two person fire tent, that is light enough to compete with modern trekking tents, he came up with the Tschum 2p. After one year of prototyping and testing, the production started in January 2016. Their tents are completely handmade in Germany. They have a <a href="https://tschum.de/index.php?route=product/category&amp;path=77_78">transparent cost structure</a>, and <a href="https://tschum.de/index.php?route=product/category&amp;path=77_79">share their designs</a> on their website.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24885667599/in/dateposted/" title="Tschum 04"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1629/24885667599_b4bbf4fc00_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Tschum 04" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>As usual in cottages, every single tent is manufactured one at a time to the customers needs and order. After a final quality control the Tschum is labeled and signed by its creator, so it is possible for you to speak to exactly the person who built your entire tent. You know that means you will have to wait for them doing the job, which normally takes them about four weeks. The „Tschums“ are highly customizable, with many options and materials available - Feel free to ask them for more infos. </p>

<p>We also offer different <a href="https://tschum.de/index.php?route=product/category&amp;path=62">firebowls</a> and stoves that match the Tschum. And currently they are working on a 4P version and are experimenting with ultralight materials.</p>

<h2 id="laufbursche-gear">LAUFBURSCHE Gear</h2>

<p>I’m sad that I need to share these <a href="http://www.laufbursche-gear.de/news">news about LAUFBURSCHE</a> with you, but Mateusz was diagnosed with cancer and now will go through the difficult and hard process of healing. If you’re pondering about how you could help him in this difficult time please keep an eye on his website and this <a href="http://www.ultraleicht-trekking.com/forum/topic/3504-schulterschluss-für-mateusz/">thread on the Ultraleicht Forum</a>. Backpacks will obviously not be made &amp; sold for the time being, but you could still purchase any of the other <a href="http://www.laufbursche-gear.de/products/">ultralight equipment</a> he sells.</p>

<h2 id="revelate-designs">Revelate Designs</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.revelatedesigns.com">Revelate Designs</a> News - coming soon! </p>

<p>And btw, if you love Revelate Designs - they <a href="http://www.revelatedesigns.com/site/index.php/employment-opportunity/">are hiring</a>.</p>

<h2 id="mountain-laurel-designs">Mountain Laurel Designs</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.mountainlaureldesigns.com">Mountain Laurel Designs</a> has some big things coming in 2016. Mountain Laurel Designs’ new 2016 Pro SilNyon is in stock and shipping. It is 30% stronger, 15% lighter and has 3X the waterproofness vs older versions. The WP is well above 5,000mm and this new coating will dramatically increase overall performance, durability and longevity of our shelters in the harshest conditions.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24957719220/in/dateposted/" title="MLD 7000mm"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1695/24957719220_b9ae18eea0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="690" alt="MLD 7000mm" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>MLD’s entire pack line is now available in a Cuben Fiber/ Dyneema Composite Fabric option. These packs are lighter weight and are fully taped for waterproofness.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24622682964/in/dateposted/" title="MLD"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1707/24622682964_47a8642c0f_b.jpg" width="735" height="1024" alt="MLD" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The FKT (Fastest Known Time) gear line is growing and includes a Pack, Quilt, Cuben eVENT Bivy and Shelter. Designed for speed hikes and special Outdoor Missions this equipment is SUL. The Quilt and Bivy are already out and the <a href="http://www.mountainlaureldesigns.com/shop/product_info.php?products_id=228">FKT Bivy</a> won an Award from the TGO magazine. It’s the lightest full-feature waterproof Bivy Sack available. It uses a Dyneema Non-Woven (Cuben Fiber) eVENT top and a Dyneema NonWoven Bottom.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25227064736/in/dateposted/" title="MLD FKT Soul headend"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1457/25227064736_dc254604d6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="983" alt="MLD FKT Soul headend" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.mountainlaureldesigns.com/shop/product_info.php?cPath=52&amp;products_id=227">Quilt</a> is similar to the MLD Spirit Quilt and has 2X the insulation on the lower part for fast moving hikers and runners who pack less lower body daytime insulation but need that at night. And the pack will be similar in size and design to the Burn with new features for fast moving adventures, with a late February Release. The shelter on the other hand is a secret still and should be out in late February or March.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25160162661/in/dateposted/" title="MLD 2016 Supermid"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1489/25160162661_e40ed2bd9d_b.jpg" width="864" height="569" alt="MLD 2016 Supermid" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The 2016 SuperMid comes in the new SilNylon with extra guy line points in case you want to take it out in galeforce winds. Also all other MLD Pyramids now have updated larger peak vents. The DuoMid XL, as the SuperMid, has additional guyout points on the main ridgelines for really rough weather. There is also a larger SuperMid Mondo for larger groups because our new stronger silnylon make larger Mids possible. All Mids will also have a snow skirt custom option.</p>

<p>If you like cuben (or whatever Dyneema fancies calling it nowadays) the MLD .75 Cuben Fiber/ Dyneema Composite Fabric shelters now have a color option. The standard light green and the new lower cost .75  white option, with a few shelters also having an even lighter .5 cuben fiber fabric option.</p>

<p>Finally, production changes at MLD means they will offer a much shorter wait times versus previous years! So if you want a FKT bivy for that next trip - give Ron a call! </p>

<h2 id="hanchor">Hanchor</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.hanchor.com">HANCHOR</a> is planning to release 3 backpacks with their Two-track suspension system, a minimalist small backpack, and all new built-in chalk sock chalk bag and chalk bucket. </p>

<p>The Two Track Suspension in a Nutshell: The Shoulder straps connect all the way to the back creating a ventilated back panel and providing basic support for a frame less mode in a weight saving way. Two vertical and one lateral aluminum stay can be inserted to stay in the same piece of back panel and add the stability of the suspension system in a weight saving way. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24644025573/in/dateposted/" title="Hanchor Two Track Suspension"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1660/24644025573_47d126fa6d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="1024" alt="Hanchor Two Track Suspension" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>New is the Xeno Ultralight open basket backpack. Think <a href="http://bit.ly/1Q6XotU">ULA Epic</a> gone lightweight. It is 741 g with the removable hipbelt and sternum strap, the vertical aluminum and lateral aluminum stays add 114 g and 31 g respecively. It is made from TPU laminated Cordura 420d, Cordura 100d and Xpac vx21, has 50 l volume and the Two-Track ventilated suspension system. 2 long daisy chains and two gear loops on the hip belt let you strap on kit, and it is compatible with a dry bag up to 50 l so you can separate your kit. A durable mesh fabric at bottom drains water, which makes the Xeno well-suited for for river climbing, canyoneering, and wet weather condition climbing or backpacking.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24640188984/in/dateposted/" title="Hanchor Xeno"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1524/24640188984_d898967f01_b.jpg" width="1024" height="1024" alt="Hanchor Xeno" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Flint is a simple-designed ultralight climbing backpack with 42 l Volume and is made from Xpac vx21 and Cordura 100d. Again the Two-Track ventilated suspension system is along, which makes this pack 866 g light with the removable hipbelt and sternum strap. And again the vertical aluminum and lateral aluminum stays add 114 g and 31 g respecively, with two long daisy chains, two gear loops on the hip belt and two axe loops to store equipment. The roll-top closure and compression straps help to compress the volume, and the bottom seam binding make this pack easily stand on the ground.</p>

<h2 id="black-rock-gear">Black Rock Gear</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.blackrockgear.com">Black Rock Gear</a> hopes to get the first run of Synthetic fill beanies and foldback mitts out soon. Hats and mitts that looks similar to the Black Hat and Black foldback mitts should pop up in their shop during March, so keep an eye out for it if you need something toasty that is not down.</p>

<h2 id="warbonnet-outdoors">Warbonnet Outdoors</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.warbonnetoutdoors.com">Warbonnet Outdoors</a> has a few cool pieces of kit in the making that they hope to have out later this year: A full-length underquilt for the Blackbird and Blackbird XLC models, a lightweight packable rain jacket made from their tarp fabric and their own custom camo pattern option for all their fabrics!</p>

<h2 id="enlightened-equipment">Enlightened Equipment</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.enlightenedequipment.com">Enlightened Equipment</a> is in the process of moving to a huge new facility, and once that is done they will have a full time product development team to dream up new ways to sleep toasty warm. </p>

<p>Additionally they recently added 950fp down as an option for all down quilt options. As you know, that is a great choice for those who need the smallest possible pack size (bikepackers love the compressibility!) and lowest weight, and they are also offering DownTek™ water repellent down as an additional protection against moisture.</p>

<p>Recently launched is the <a href="http://www.enlightenedequipment.com/convert/">Convert</a>. The quilt sizes up the award-winning Revelation, adds a full-length draft-blocked zipper and is sized up to allow a very spacious sleeping bag/ quilt hybrid that is very comfortable, especially for side and stomach sleepers. The drawcord footbox makes adapting to warmer weather quick and simple, and if it’s warmer still, just unzip it all the way and use it as a flat blanket.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24885664329/in/dateposted/" title="Enlightened Equipment 2016 Convert"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1676/24885664329_5a55bc9c2d_b.jpg" width="1000" height="1000" alt="Enlightened Equipment 2016 Convert" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="katabatic-gear">Katabatic Gear</h2>

<p><a href="http://katabaticgear.com/">Katabatic Gear</a> added a new line of sleeping bags which they are very excited about. Their customers demanded a blanket-style quilt and so they delivered: The <a href="http://katabaticgear.com/flex-sleeping-bags/">Flex Series</a>, which is available in 40°, 30°, 22°, and 15° options, as well as five different sizes. The Flex quilts are designed with the award-winning features you have come to expect from them, like the Katabatic attachment system, a down filled collar and draft blocking foot box closure which guards from the cold. But when you need some ventilation, the zippered foot box allows you to completely open the quilt up to a blanket, which makes for a truly flexible sleep system.</p>

<p>If you look for an affordable paddle, take a look at the new <a href="http://www.packrafting-store.de/Paddle/Classic-paddles/Anfibio-Basic-4p::630.html">Anfibio Basic 4p</a> which proofs that the entry to Packrafting does not need to be expensive! </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25160162921/in/dateposted/" title="Anfibio Basic 4p"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1539/25160162921_9766fd157a.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="Anfibio Basic 4p" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>As ultralight backpackers we know that small items make the difference. The Packrafting Store offers a <a href="http://www.packrafting-store.de/Accessories/Tie-downs-Lug-Strap::633.html">variety of alternative grab loops</a>, that allow tailoring your packraft. </p>

<p>And if you follow packrafters on Twitter you probably have seen that packrafting goes fishing. The Packrafting Store now carry packraft specific fishing accessories, starting off with a <a href="http://www.packrafting-store.de/Accessories/Floating-Fish-Net-by-WindPaddle::632.html">Floating Fishing Net</a> and a <a href="http://www.packrafting-store.de/Accessories/RodRig-fishing-rod-mount::637.html">Rod holder</a>.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25160162791/in/dateposted/" title="Floating Fishing Net"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1676/25160162791_a5b7e69738.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="Floating Fishing Net" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Most interesting will be the new boats - from Ultralight to Whitewater - as well as new colors (<a href="http://www.packrafting-store.de/Packrafts/Universal/MRS-Adventure-X2::615.html">Adventure X2</a> in Luminous red!) that will be available soon. You can find all that in their <a href="http://www.packrafting-store.de/Neu:::55.html?XTCsid=p91pebqera1b0p55lngi5ggc92">New section</a>, and check out their 4th anniversary specials! </p>

<p>Last but not least, we support <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/01/zero-gear-year.html">Hendrik’s #NoGearYear initiative</a> and hold our <a href="http://www.packrafting-store.de/Vermietung:::34.html">rental program</a> ready :) Don’t forget we carry most <a href="http://www.packrafting-store.de/Ersatzteile:::62.html">replacement part</a> for all types of packrafts as well as repair supplies and workshop service to maintain your existing gear. </p>

<p>Finally, if you want to go packraft in Africa - take a look at their <a href="http://www.packrafting-store.de/Kurse-und-Touren:::21.html">new destinations page</a>!</p>

<h2 id="elemental-horizons">Elemental Horizons</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.elementalhorizons.com">Elemental Horizons</a> has some pretty exciting stuff in store for 2016. They are planning the launch of several new products, including a roll top version of the popular <a href="http://www.elementalhorizons.com/aduro-sl-pack/">Aduro SL pack</a> and an all new day pack in the 20 - 25 l range. These new packs will be available late spring or summer 2016. In the past fall they launched a new shoulder strap water <a href="http://www.elementalhorizons.com/shoulder-strap-bottle-holder/">bottle holder</a>. The shoulder strap bottle holder is the perfect size to hold most 20 oz. standard drink bottles, has a draw string closure and has a built in stash pocket on the front to hold small items like chap stick, bug spray or a smartphone. The bottle holder mounts easily to just about any pack shoulder strap and sells for $18.</p>

<h2 id="tread-lite-gear">Tread Lite Gear</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/usr/stokepa31?_trksid=p2047675.l2559">Tread Lite Gear</a> is a new cottage out of the United Kingdom, and a search for Tread Lite Gear on ebay should get you to their items. Cuben stuff sacks and wallets, MYOG fabrics and materials and other ultralight gear you can find there, so have a look.</p>

<h2 id="yama-mountain-gear">YAMA Mountain Gear</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.yamamountaingear.com">YAMA Mountain Gear</a> has relocated into a larger space in the Appalachian Trail Town of Waynesboro, Virginia.  The are now next to the backpackers’ camp where AT hikers stay while they resupply in town! YAMA has also welcomed PCT thru-hiker Greg Arpante to their team to assist with design and fabrication. Gen and Greg are working hard to introduce a new line of backpacks and fastpacking packs, a 1-person version of the Swiftline shelter, and more. Soon they also hope to launch the “YAMA Labs” as a way to foster product development; which is partly a behind the scenes look at product development and partly a demo and testing opportunity. Cool!</p>

<h2 id="goosefeet-gear">GooseFeet Gear</h2>

<p><a href="https://goosefeetgear.com/">GooseFeet Gear</a> has finally officially released their <a href="https://goosefeetgear.com/products/5-down-pants">custom down pants</a>! These down pants are custom sized for every customer and use the lightest 10d fabrics available. You can also add such options as box baffling and side zippers to get exactly what you are looking for, and if there are any additional options that you would want, Ben can usually accommodate those as well! </p>

<h2 id="six-moon-designs">Six Moon Designs</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.sixmoondesigns.com">Six Moon Designs</a> has a revamped pack line up which has gone online a few months ago. With these packs they’ve done a lot of fine tuning based upon user feedback and so far all the changes have been well received. SMD has also added a new pack to the lineup, the <a href="https://www.sixmoondesigns.com/packs/Flex.html?redirected=1">Flex</a>, which provides a lot of flexibility for those carrying odd loads. Ron want you to know that there won’t be big changes in the shelters for the coming year.</p>

<h2 id="qiwiznet">QiWiz.net</h2>

<p><a href="http://qiwiz.net">QiWiz UL Gear</a> is best known for their titanium cathole trowels, but also make and sell titanium wood burning stoves, ultralight buck saws, titanium spatulas, and other ultralight cooking options. </p>

<p>Rob’s biggest news for 2016 is that he is no longer a one-person operation. After the last 4 years of rapid growth, demand for the Big Dig and other sizes of <a href="http://qiwiz.net/trowels.html">titanium cathole trowels</a> has gotten to the point that he has hired a member of his backpacking club to help me with production. 
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25253243655/in/dateposted/" title="QiWiz.net Big Digs in production"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1712/25253243655_725ae39429.jpg" width="500" height="309" alt="QiWiz.net Big Digs in production" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>A nice design improvement for the FireFly ultralight titanium wood burning stoves has recently been introduced. They have added a vertical crease in the top half of each stove side for a 3-D shape that adds greater strength with no weight penalty. Rob is really happy that he has even been able to do this with the FlexPort side that allows the user to feed longer sticks into the firebox. The pictures below show the new creased sides next to the previous design that was flat. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25134978272/in/dateposted/" title="QiWiz.net FireFly ultralight titanium wood burning stove 01"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1469/25134978272_8d1104f282.jpg" width="500" height="234" alt="QiWiz.net FireFly ultralight titanium wood burning stove 01" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="locus-gear">Locus Gear</h2>

<p><a href="http://locusgear.com/?lang=en">Locus Gear</a> will possibly release a modified version of their popular Khufu CTF3 called Khufu CTF3-B this spring or early summer. As Jotaro is still testing it no exact release date has been decided yet. The shape itself is almost the same as the normal version of the Khufu CTF3, but as you can notice ,there is a letter “B” at the end of the name - which stands for advanced bonding technique so that there is no seam line at the main structure except around the zipper. Even the seam line around the zipper is taped over by the same bonding technique as an additional reinforcement. This all means you don’t have to apply seam sealing. Additionally there is a modified air vent and more new innovations in this shelter, so keep an eye out for it! </p>

<p>Secondly, Locus Gear will release a new foam sleeping mat called “Onda” in the spring. The mat has a patented unique waved foam surface combined with a thin flat foam base. The weight is about 250 g in the size of 180 cm x 50 cm x 1 cm! </p>

<h2 id="zpacks">ZPacks</h2>

<p><a href="http://zpacks.com">ZPacks</a> offers a freestanding modification to their Duplex tent for a while, the <a href="http://zpacks.com/shelter/duplex-flex.shtml">Duplex Flex Tent</a>. Some “beta” customers have taken it outside already and have provided feedback thus far. Additionally, ZPAcks has moved to a larger building (again) in November and have been hiring a bunch of seamsters to help them meet demand this spring! </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/25272152825/in/dateposted/" title="ZPacks Duplex Flex Tent"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1446/25272152825_07694624c9.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="ZPacks Duplex Flex Tent" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="ks-ultralight-gear">KS ultralight gear</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.ks-ultralightgear.com">KS ultralight gear</a> has a new <a href="http://www.ks-ultralightgear.com/p/bike-packs.html">Saddle Pack</a> and <a href="http://www.ks-ultralightgear.com/p/lua-ack.html">Waist Pack</a>. These specialized pieces of kit probably are interesting to bikepackers and trailrunners who want a customizable option.</p>

<p>Cottage Manufacturers are busy people - some are just now out hiking, other’s are finishing up your gear. That’s why not every cottage is on this list. It’s a living document, though, and likely will be updated a couple of times during the next few weeks while more companies are added. Either check back at the end of the week or follow along on <a href="http://facebook.com/hikinginfinland">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hendrikmorkel">Twitter</a> where I will announce updates.

<p>I have mentioned before that <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/08/love-the-dolomites-tour.html">I love the Dolomites</a> and so it was a great pleasure to return in Winter to <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/11/spring-adventures-in-kronplatz.html">Kronplatz</a> in South Tyrol and go ski-touring. My brother and me spent three beautiful days in the <a href="http://www.kronplatz.com/en/val-casies-monguelfo-tesido/winter/cross-country-skiing">Gsieser Valley</a>, then packed up our gear and continued across the border to Austria and the beautiful <a href="https://www.lungau.at">Salzburger Lungau</a> region where we spent another three days of ski-touring. As I’m right now wrapping up some other work projects and packing for a trip to Switzerland I leave you with some impressions from last week to wet your appetite for the coming trip report from these two trips! </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year I was fortunate to escape the dreaded month of November for a week and enjoy sunshine &amp; cycling along the coast of Portugal, riding over 500 km from Lisbon to Porto.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/23170406440/in/album-72157659581645884/" title="Cabo da Roca"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5701/23170406440_011dc7899e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Cabo da Roca" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>After thru-hiking the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/01/hogakustenleden-the-high-coast-trail.html">High Coast Trail</a> in November of 2014 and experiencing all the weather you can expect in November in Scandinavia - snow, sleet, rain, grey clouds as far as you can see and a tiny bit of sun - my mind was set on the south for outdoor trips in November. Last year it was so far: I boarded a plane in Vaasa with my <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/11/pelago-bicycles-stavanger.html">Pelago Stavanger</a> and flew to Lisbon, where +20°C temperatures and sunshine where waiting for me. During the following weeks I will share the adventure of riding in this beautiful country, but I already now want to get you in the mood for cycling in Portugal! </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/23380978901/in/album-72157659581645884/" title="Hello Beach!"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/720/23380978901_4d30838bf6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Hello Beach!" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Riding from Lisbon to Porto made a lot of sense to me while planning this trip. And there were even other people who have done similar tours. But being on the road for a week and cycling North, I quickly decided that I makes more sense to do this trip the other way around. The reason is the North-Westerly wind which I had every day, and while Headwind is to be expected when cycling, some days I was swearing so much about the f#€k!n6 headwind that I made a mental note to recommend this tour the other way around. It’s a lot nicer to cycle with tailwind than cycling against a headwind which slows you sometimes down so much that you’re almost standing still.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/22835147394/in/album-72157659581645884/" title="Lighthouse"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5762/22835147394_f5b1594fd6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Lighthouse" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I rode from Cascais, a suburb of Lisbon, to Sintra on Day 1, an easy 40 km which also took me to Cabo da Roca, the most westerly point of the European continent. On day 2 I managed to ride a 20 km Detour so that I arrived in Peniche at dusk with over 114 km cycled, while Day 3 where only 90 km to São Pedro de Moel where the fine Lighthouse above was warning the ships out in the ocean. </p>

<p>Day 4 I cycled to Coimbra which had me swearing the most about the headwind as I was cycling on a completely straight road to Pedrogão, though happily it got a bit less windy as I cycled inland. Cycling to Aveiro on Day 5 was more relaxed, though the cycling out of Coimbra in the fog with a visibility of less than 100 m had me scared about being crashed into a couple of times. On my last day to Porto I was cycling inland through tranquil little villages, up steep, steep cobblestone roads in the middle of the forest and then finally crossed the bridge into Porto, which put a big smile on my face. </p>

<p>If you want to escape November in Scandinavia &amp; Central Europe go cycling or hiking in Portugal, where it is a beautiful sunny month with nice temperatures. I had help from <a href="http://a2z-adventures.com/en/">A2Z Adventures</a> during the planning and execution of my trip, and if you don’t want to go to Portugal on your own or fly with your bike join one of their <a href="http://a2z-adventures.com/en/find-trip/biking">Biking Trips</a> - they have everything from self-guided trips to a guide cycling next to you and telling you all about the country. I cycled light and slept in B&amp;Bs and Hotels along the way, and traded the stove and freezer bag meals to Lunches and Dinners in Cafés and Restaurants - Portugal is very affordable for Scandinavians. More coming soon, so <em>stay tuned for my Day-to-Day account coming to your favourite Scandinavian Outdoor Travel Blog!</em></p>

<h2 id="scarpa">Scarpa</h2>

<p>A visit to <a href="http://scarpa.it">Scarpa</a> is a sure thing on any fair for me. This family company makes some of the best climbing &amp; mountaineering shoes on the market, has great, friendly athletes and makes simply cool shoes. Shoes like the Atom S, a trailrunning shoe that has a Sock-Fit construction like many other Scarpa shoes, too. The whole upper, including the gaiter, is made without a zipper and has an OutDry® lamination which makes the shoe warm &amp; dry even in the snow while keeping snow, dirt and other stuff out.

<h2 id="black-diamond">Black Diamond</h2>

<p><a href="http://blackdiamondequipment.com">Black Diamond</a> makes seriously light &amp; high-quality gear so any aspiring Splitborder and ultralight backpacker does well to check their gear out. You weren’t able to go to the ISPO? Well good thing that I was there and swung by at BD! The Razor Carbon Ski Pole is made from aluminium and carbon, and the SwitchRelease easily opens for those situations where you need to get rid of the pole fast. It’s otherwise a normal strap that’s easy to get in and out of, and you can lock the strap also in place. They weigh 596 g and are available in two lengths: 110-125 cm and 115-140 cm. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24915606205/in/dateposted/" title="Black Diamond Razor Carbon Ski Pole"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1606/24915606205_013e500053_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Black Diamond Razor Carbon Ski Pole" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Storm headlamp weighs including batteries only 110 g and packs 250 Lumen, which illuminates the hills and forests up to 80 m far. It has the PowerTap™ Technology along which allows for fast &amp; simple transitioning between full and dimmed power in order to momentarily increase illumination in distance and proximity modes, and also has a Red and Green SinglePower LEDs for night vision along. It needs uses four AAA batteries and has a three-level power meter which shows the remaining battery life.</p>

<p>The Helio Cirque 35 Pack is a medium-sized ski pack which is designed for alpine expeditions. It is compatible with the BD AvaLung Element and has SwingArm™ shoulder straps. A Cinch closure as in <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/07/patagonia-ascensionist-pack-45l.html">other packs</a> can be opened &amp; closed with one hand, there’s an optional SilNylon lid pocket available. Skis can be carried in an A-Frame or diagonally and as usual on BD packs, there’s the nice stowable helmet flap. </p>

<p>Onwards to garments and the First Light Hoody. It’s a breathable insulation piece filled with 60g/ m2 PrimaLoft® Silver Insulation Active and has a lightweight Schoeller shell which also has their Nanosphere DWR. The fit is regular and it weighs 440 g. As an alpine climbing/ mountaineering jacket it has a helmet-compatible hood and stows in its internal chest pocket, which also has a with carabiner clip. </p>

<h2 id="poc">POC</h2>

<p>Remember Rule 1? Good. <a href="http://www.pocsports.com">POC</a> from Sweden knows a thing about looking cool, as well as keeping you safe and in one piece when you’re out doing adventure sports. The Aspire shades underneath are some mean looking urban-inspired sunglasses which bring you back to the golden 60s - Don Draper would wear these, be assured. The Cold-Brown tint has been developed for urban environments, as the glasses allow you to better recognize contrasts in traffic and from stop lights. If you hike the streets - wear these.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24018857064/in/dateposted/" title="ISPO 2016 Impressions"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1627/24018857064_7c91a9fcaf_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="ISPO 2016 Impressions" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>You rather be safe than look cool? Well, with the POC Layer System you can have both. It’s an ISPO Award Winner and a baselayer that can be adapted to your needs in terms of safety. They have a seamless construction laser-cut pockets on on the shoulders, arms, thighs and knees which lets you slip in POC VPD System pads which have a 3D molded design for optimal coverage of the body. The top and bottoms themselves are quick-drying and made from a lightweight fabric, with mesh areas in the back and knees for better ventilation. Surely not something for hikers, but cyclists and skiers will find this useful.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24888083976/in/dateposted/" title="POC Layer 3"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1610/24888083976_51fb6ed0b7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="POC Layer 3" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Auric Pro features a Multi-impact VPD 2.0 + EPP liner, a durable ABS shell, can be used with a beanie and goggles under the helmet and has two sets of ear pads included. As a helmet for park riders I don’t expect to see this on the trails, but if you like to throw Miller Flips down the pipe this might be a piece of kit you’d like to have on your head. Oh, and it looks cool, too =)</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24286132574/in/dateposted/" title="POC Auric Pro Helmet"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1709/24286132574_95f6f98955_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="POC Auric Pro Helmet" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><em>The coolest</em> kit from POC is however, for me, their Googles. The Zeiss lenses now come with a Ripel treatment which makes them hydrophobic and oleophobic - so no more fingerprints and dried water drops will hinder your vision. The lenses now got thicker - a whooping 1,8 mm, and with 14 different google models to choose from and 11 different lens configurations it’s not easy to find the best POC Googles for you, but once you do - you’ll love them. And look cool. Like me and my <a href="http://bit.ly/1K9FXd5">LID</a>.</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer: I paid everything myself to visit the ISPO, so actually there’s nothing to disclose here. Except, possibly maybe, that one beer I drunk at Arc’teryx.</em></p>

<p>For starters read <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/02/ispo-2016-news-i.html">ISPO News Part I</a>.</p>

<h2 id="petzl">Petzl</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.petzl.com">Petzl</a> is hands-down my favourite climbing gear manufacturer so a stop at their booth is mandatory. The big news from them was something that made me as an ultralight backpacker and an aspiring ski-mountaineer very happy: An ultralight SkiMo kit that weighs in at 2 kg! </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24740315931/in/dateposted/" title="Petzl Fast &amp; Light SkiMo Gear"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1588/24740315931_e7cedf4f6a_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Petzl Fast &amp; Light SkiMo Gear" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The kit starts off with the Altitude Harness, which uses the WIREFRAME Technology so the whole harness weighs just 150 g! You can put it on without taking your skis or crampons off as I tried on the fair, and it packs very small. It is a minimalist mountaineering/ ski harness so ideal if you traverse a glacier or rappel down a couloir. It packs small, will cost around 70€ and is available from July 2016 (!) onwards.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24205648674/in/dateposted/" title="Petzl Altitude Harness 3"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1546/24205648674_0297af33e5_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Petzl Altitude Harness 3" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Leopard LLF is a ten point crampon that weighs 330 g for the pair! The CORD-TEC flexible linking system reduces crampon volume and yes, I asked about the durability of these cords: <em>“Prototypes have been used for over a year now and yet a cord needs to break.”</em> After all you’re gonna walk on snow with these, so there’s not really much chances of the cord getting broken - unlike if you use them on sharp rock. They pack really small, are easy to put on your boot and the sizes can be adjusted in seconds by putting the cord over the hooks in the back part. They too will be in July 2016 in the shops and cost 116€.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24833818525/in/dateposted/" title="Petzl Leopard LLF Crampon"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1681/24833818525_90767efc46_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Petzl Leopard LLF Crampon" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><em>“Now we just need an ice axe for skiers”</em> you might think, but Petzl thought this also and hence you’ll be able to buy the Ride ice axe in July for 80€. The axe is 45 cm long, a length which makes it easy to attach to backpacks or even carry them inside of a larger pack, and it weighs 240 g. The pick is made from steel and is 3 mm thick at the front so will penetrate ice well. It has a slight curve in the Type 1 shaft, felt good in my hand and is compatible with the <a href="https://www.bergzeit.de/petzl-linkin-handschlaufe/?pid=81">Petzl LINKIN Leash</a>.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24833813565/in/dateposted/" title="Petzl Ride Ice Axe"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1521/24833813565_4787161c04_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Petzl Ride Ice Axe" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The RAD Line was previously only available as part of the <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/petzl-rad-system-spaltenbergungsset/?pid=10239">RAD System</a>, but from July 2016 onwards you can buy the very light 60 m rope for 180€ also on its own. At 22 g per meter it is a great choice for glacier travel &amp; rescue as well as rappelling. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24205611464/in/dateposted/" title="Petzl RAD Line 2"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1492/24205611464_a94c2af985_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Petzl RAD Line 2" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>That was the climbing and mountaineering side of things, onwards to Lightning. There is coming a free MyPetzl Light mobile app for REACTIK+ and NAO+ connected headlamps in July to the Apple and Android Stores, which will work with the two named models, via Bluetooth. The Bluetooth is supposed to be low in energy consumption, and allows you to control the Headlamp via your phone in the same way you’re already now able to control the Nao via the Software on your computer. It sounds pretty good to be able to tell your headlamp for example that you will be out for six hours and hence want the optimal output over that period of time, all controlled from your phone. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24717705172/in/dateposted/" title="MyPetzl Light 1"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1576/24717705172_8665d394f5_b.jpg" width="576" height="1024" alt="MyPetzl Light 1" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24742106331/in/dateposted/" title="MyPetzl Light 2"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1479/24742106331_ce3620cb28_b.jpg" width="576" height="1024" alt="MyPetzl Light 2" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The two compatible headlamps are the Reactik+ and the Nao+. The latter will come with 750 Lumen and the former with 300 Lumen. The Nao will weigh 185 g, has a removable battery pack in the back which also has a red light so you’re seen from behind, and will cost 160€ once it comes out in October 2016. The Reactik+ will be 115 g light, costs 90€ and will already be available in July 2016.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24740320561/in/dateposted/" title="Petzl Reactik+"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1508/24740320561_2b68518e8b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Petzl Reactik+" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24715967912/in/dateposted/" title="Petzl Nao+"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1631/24715967912_6c858ed594_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Petzl Nao+" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="pieps">PIEPS</h2>

<p>This was my first visit at <a href="http://www.pieps.com">PIEPS</a>, the Austrian company specializing in Avalanche security gear. They presented their brand-new PIEPS MICRO, their smallest and lightest 3-antenna-beacon which comes with sensor technology and an app-controlled device management via Bluetooth. It has a big display for easy readability and a sensor which puts it automatically into search mode if you take it out of the holster. It’s 150 g light and has a size of 102 x 71 x 18 mm which makes it right now the smallest avalanche beacon on the market. It has a circular receiving range of 40 m which is a bit less than other 3-antenna beacons, but that’s not too big of a drawback. It will cost 350€.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24715994202/in/dateposted/" title="Pieps"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1691/24715994202_9558c585c5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Pieps" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24206995643/in/dateposted/" title="Pieps Micro"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1610/24206995643_855ce7c011_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Pieps Micro" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The iPROBE II is the second generation of the iProbe, 350 g light and 220 cm long. The fully automatic electronic avalanche probe enables peers to be rescued even more quickly with its acoustic and visual hit indicator, which saves time &amp; reduces misinterpretations while pinpointing a buried friend. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24807579896/in/dateposted/" title="Pieps iProbe 2"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1585/24807579896_d8c387350e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Pieps iProbe 2" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Shovel C’s selling point is it’s C handle, which is easy to grip even with fat mitts on - unlike a T-handle. It comes in two weights: 660 g and 720 g, with a telescope shaft which is 88 cm and 90 cm long respectively. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24807591256/in/dateposted/" title="Pieps Shovel C"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1535/24807591256_760ecbc1b8_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Pieps Shovel C" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="patagonia">Patagonia</h2>

<p>There were three big news from <a href="http://bit.ly/1vVr6Wj">Patagonia</a>, but their Worn Wear campaign on the booth certainly was most interesting. There’s going to be a Worn Wear Campaign in Europe where a team of sewers will travel the continent and fix your broken Patagonia garments, so if you want something repaired keep an eye out for it on their website. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24206849183/in/dateposted/" title="DIY Repair Guide"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1657/24206849183_d646986eb8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="DIY Repair Guide" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24833700525/in/dateposted/" title="Fix it!"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1588/24833700525_b7b74283c1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Fix it!" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Then there’s the Patagonia exclusive PrimaLoft Gold Insulation Eco, a synthetic insulation made from 55% recycled content with 100% performance of normal Primaloft. PrimaLoft themselves were so positive about this new insulation material that they committed to replace all their PrimaLoft Gold Insulation with PrimaLoft Gold Insulation Eco beginning in 2017! All Patagonia Nano Puff styles - Vest, Pullover, Jacket and Hoody - come in Fall 2016 with the 60-g PrimaLoft Gold Insulation Eco. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24206866613/in/dateposted/" title="Patagonia Nano Puff Revolution"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1513/24206866613_9e94de0f1d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Patagonia Nano Puff Revolution" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24715847122/in/dateposted/" title="Patagonia Nano Puff Ingredients"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1470/24715847122_fecb658d93_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Patagonia Nano Puff Ingredients" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The second big news was the 100% recycled down. The 600 fill power goose and duck down is reclaimed from used items that can’t be resold and offers identical performance to virgin down. The first garments to use the material are the more urban-styled Bivy Down Jackets &amp; Vests, the M’s Down Snap-T® Pullover and the Down Shirts which could work well for backpacking and camping. No info on weights, sorry, prices go from 200€ to 250€ for these pieces.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24833771185/in/dateposted/" title="Patagonia Recycled Down"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1591/24833771185_c27a475bb4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Patagonia Recycled Down" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And then the technical Alpine gear. The Stretch Nano Storm Jacket I’m wearing underneath is the <a href="http://bit.ly/20M5T2i">Nano Air Hoody</a> wrapped into a H2No Performance Standard shell fabric, creating a jacket which keeps the elements at bay when you climb and while you belay your mate in a blizzard - no more need to pull on a belay parka with this one on. It will cost 470€, again sadly no infos on weights (but it wasn’t light). </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24807500156/in/dateposted/" title="Patagonia"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1599/24807500156_6228ef5da4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Patagonia" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="ortovox">ORTOVOX</h2>

<p><a href="http://ortovox.com">ORTOVOX</a> News coming in a wee bit!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24807370916/in/dateposted/" title="ORTOVOX Avabag &amp; Backpacks"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1447/24807370916_1c488efc66_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="ORTOVOX Avabag &amp; Backpacks" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="dps-skis">DPS Skis</h2>

<p>I do like my <a href="http://www.dpsskis.com">DPS Skis</a> so I scheduled a visit at their booth to see what’s coming next winter from this innovative ski maker. Brand-new next season is their Foundation Line pictured underneath, which uses best-in-class components to create a durable and long-lasting ski. From Polyamide topsheets over a bamboo and poplar core to a graphite race base, the Foundation skis should suit a wide variety of skiers. Benefits of the Foundation skis include effortless turn initiation, a solid and powerful drive from mid-turn to exit and that the skis throughout the line feel familiar if you belong to those people who need more than one pair of skis.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24564799671/in/dateposted/" title="DPS Skis Foundation Line Skis"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1504/24564799671_e760f4a422_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="DPS Skis Foundation Line Skis" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>But I was more interested in the new Tour1 models. Tour1 is DPS’ backcountry/ ski-touring build of skis which are very light but have great downhill performance - fast up and fun on the way to the valley. The (green) Cassier 87 is the ultralight ski for fast ascents as it fits into thin skintracks and weighs just 1340 g at 178 cm length. At 121/ 87/ 109 it still offers good all-snow and all-mountain performance, for fun days out on the hills.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24740258271/in/dateposted/" title="DPS Skis Tour1 Skis"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1454/24740258271_02c432cf2a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="DPS Skis Tour1 Skis" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24538223670/in/dateposted/" title="DPS Skis Tour1 Cassier 87"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1542/24538223670_3dcc705fd9_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="DPS Skis Tour1 Cassier 87" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The (blue) Wailer 106 is also new, weighs 1.440 g at 178 cm length and has the fine measurements of 133/ 106/ 122. DPS suggests this ski as your one ski if you life in a region which sees consitent snow, measured in centimeters and not meters, as it fits well into the skin track and delivers broad pleasures and predicable precision with its Chassis-driven rocker &amp; sidecut design.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24833749245/in/dateposted/" title="DPS Skis Tour 1 Wailer 106"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1620/24833749245_3e0bbc75e4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="DPS Skis Tour 1 Wailer 106" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And then there’s the beautiful Tour1 Zelda 106 ski in awesome purple for Women. It weighs 1.340 g in 168 cm length and a bit less in 158 cm length. A ski for ladies who are out already with the first snow in late November and will first leave the mountains in June when even on Lyngen the last snow is melting away, the Zelda 106 should be a great touring skis. Did I mention that I love the colour? Good.</p>

<h2 id="spark-rd">Spark R&amp;D</h2>

<p>Splitboarding? Yes! And whom better to visit than <a href="http://www.sparkrandd.com">Spark R&amp;D</a>, who celebrate their 10 year anniversary this year - congratulations! In case you’re now pondering what Splitboarding is - well, it’s a Snowboard broken down in the middle so that you can skin up the mountain with it - as with skis - and then you put it back together and snowboard down the hill. Their Tesla T1 Binding System has won numerous awards and the Surge binding underneath is Spark’s binding for big lines. They’re not new but have updated colours for the next season.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24205723804/in/dateposted/" title="Spark R&amp;D Bindings"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1442/24205723804_a0ee7888d0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Spark R&amp;D Bindings" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>As Splitborders also go up steep pointy bits a crampon like the Ibex is useful to get more grip. Available in different widths and compatible with the bindings.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24205728764/in/dateposted/" title="Spark R&amp;D Crampon"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1573/24205728764_736702f168_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Spark R&amp;D Crampon" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Dyno DH is Spark’s Splitboard binding for hardboots - think <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/12/arcteryx-procline-carbon-lite-ski-boot.html">Arc’teryx Procline</a> and similar. Tour up with normal front pieces for touring up, then slide the Dyno DH on the pucks and you’re ready to snowboard down with your hardboots. </p>

<p>New from Spark is the Zip Strap underneath, which increases the glide on flat and low angled terrain. It covers the skin with a slippery plastic film which allows you to feel like you’re on cross country skis and move faster, all without needing to take the skins off. When not needed it rolls up to a tiny package.</p>

<p>The Splitboard skins from Spark are made by G3 and come with the Spark Tailclips which attach great to your Splitboard in touring mode. For the next season they got a new look, otherwise they’re just as great as they have been.</p>
