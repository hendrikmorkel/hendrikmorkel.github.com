<p>My <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2010/10/from-russia-with-love.html">From Russia With Love</a> trip report is still super popular and in the first trekking Magazin issue of 2015 I wrote a trip report auf Deutsch. It’s a great looking article and gives tips to plan your own hike in Karelia, so well worth to pick it up just for that. In my gear column I talk about down jackets and review the <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/hagloefs-essens-ii-down-weste-noble-blue-s/?pid=81">Häglöfs Essens II Down Vest</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/14pEniz">Arc’teryx Cerium SL Jacket</a>, <a href="http://www.phdesigns.co.uk/yukon-down-jacket">PHD Yukon Down Jacket</a> and the <a href="http://bit.ly/1hh35k8">Mountain Equipment Vega Jacket</a>. </p>

<p>There’s still plenty more in there, from fine hikes in Luxembourg and Sweden to a Winter Gear Guide. Pick up the first issue of 2015 at a Newsstand near you or take out a <a href="http://www.trekkingmagazin.com/abonnement">subscription</a> to not miss any future issue.</p>

    <link href="http://hendrikmorkel.github.com/2015/01/jon-griffith-alpine-exposures.html"/>
    <updated>2015-01-09T16:17:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://hendrikmorkel.github.com/2015/01/jon-griffith-alpine-exposures</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Jon Griffith’s photo book <a href="http://www.alpineexposures.com/pages/book">Alpine Exposures</a> is the culmination of over ten years photographing in the Alps. Full of breath-taking images that depict some of the best ways to move in the mountains, this is the coffee table book you wanted for those days where you can not head out yourself or need some motivation to get up at 1 am.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16050375500" title="alpine exposures - Jon Griffith by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7577/16050375500_2694d126ac_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="alpine exposures - Jon Griffith" /></a></p>

<p>I have been following Jonathan Griffith’s photography since many years via his <a href="http://www.alpineexposures.com/blogs/chamonix-conditions">blog</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Alpine-Exposures-Jon-Griffith-Photography/120793041299250">Facebook</a> so when word came out that he was working on a photo book I knew it would be superb. Jon regularly kept readers and Fans up to date about the process of producing and publishing this book, and just in time for the holidays the alpine exposures came out last November. </p>

<p>Alpine Exposures starts off with a Foreword by Ueli Steck which is one of the best forewords I have read in a while. Honest and appraising, highlighting why Jon takes such good photos (because he’s a mountaineer first, photographer second) Ueli sets the tone for the book and gets you excited to turn the pages. Jon follows that up with an equally touching Introduction before you meet some of Jon’s rope partners and then you can start to enjoy the photos.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16211793956" title="alpine exposures - Jon Griffith by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7496/16211793956_541519cb26_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="alpine exposures - Jon Griffith" /></a></p>

<p>The book is written in three languages: English, French and German. This lingual trinity is well executed with a good layout that’s easy to read and follow throughout the book. It’s high-quality paper that depicts the superb images very well, and it’s a pleasure to read the book. The photos all are from real situations, so no fake “Lets go to the Aiguille Du Midi and do some shoots on the Cosmiques” kind of photos. The seven distinct chapters in the book show Jon’s favourite photos from Alpinism, Skiing, Climbing, Landscape, Ice Climbing, Flight (BASE and Paragliding) and Work. In between the photos are here and there short anecdotes from climbs and work trips, and some climbs are highlighted in longer photo essays which not just give you an idea of the route if you’re planning to climb it yourself, it also adds variation to the book and makes it very interesting for alpinists that want to attempt some of these routes.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16050174968" title="alpine exposures - Jon Griffith by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7517/16050174968_925b8dd4f7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="alpine exposures - Jon Griffith" /></a></p>

<p>This is the coffee table book you wished you would have gotten as a present from Santa last Christmas. Cover to cover it features breathtaking photos from the mountains and people having fun in them, and will inspire you to make a trip to Chamonix as soon as possible so you can experience the beauty yourself. It’s a book for alpinists, climbers and photographers and you’ll have a hard time putting it down once you start to read it. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/kx49us95qxbuj0f/Alpine_Exposures_Sample.pdf?dl=0">View a 60 page sample online</a>, if you’re convinced (and you will be!) you can buy your copy of <em>alpine exposures</em> directly from Jon at <a href="http://www.alpineexposures.com/products/alpine-exposures-photo-book-10-years-of-photography-by-jon-griffith">Alpine Exposures</a>, your local book shop or order it online from <a href="http://amzn.to/1I10mLL">Amazon.co.uk</a>, <a href="http://amzn.to/1xYMvBb">Amazon.com</a> or <a href="http://amzn.to/1APW8EE">Amazon.de</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://relaa.com/han">Helsinki Adventure Night</a> is a great opportunity to meet outdoor friends, watch movies and listen to a keynote speaker. And as <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/08/ueli-steck-interview.html">Ueli Steck</a> was that keynote speaker at the 2014 HAN I had to go =)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15306067413" title="Helsinki Adventure Night by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7527/15306067413_6fb9848e71_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Helsinki Adventure Night" /></a></p>

<p>Vaasa - Helsinki isn’t an easy route to travel. Flying is fastest and affordable, the train is fast with Wifi but the most expensive option, the new bus that drives this route is long and dirt cheap, and going by car is similarly long and cheap as the bus. As it was a last-minute decision to attend the <a href="http://relaa.com/han">Helsinki Adventure Night</a> I hitched a ride with friends from my climbing club, which was a very good decision as it was comfortable and fun to drive to the south and back. Anyway.</p>

<p>Once we arrived in Helsinki my friends and me headed over to the <a href="http://www.biorex.fi">Bio Rex</a> which is a beautiful movie theatre. I right away bumped into <a href="https://twitter.com/mtakanen">Marko</a> and we were chatting for a while until also <a href="https://twitter.com/j_palomaki">Joni</a> joined up with us. After discussing packrafts, Fatbikes and Nordic Skating we went in to claim our seats to watch the first movie: </p>

<iframe src="http://hendrikmorkel.github.com//player.vimeo.com/video/93102009?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff" width="1200" height="675" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>It was an inspiring documentary about life in Antarctica and besides beautiful landscapes it also described well the atmosphere, people and normal life at such a station in winter and summer. If you have a chance to see it I’d highly recommend it, especially if you like snow, ice, cold, Northern Lights and interesting people. After the movie there was a break in which I had the chance to meet part of the Finnish Scarpa Team and Ueli Steck. We’ve have met several times since my interview on different events and it was great to have Ueli in Helsinki and hear his keynote. Which was next.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15602868353" title="Helsinki Adventure Night by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8654/15602868353_1b4c2cf70c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Helsinki Adventure Night" /></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16035365430" title="Helsinki Adventure Night by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7520/16035365430_1a4df45241_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Helsinki Adventure Night" /></a></p>

<p>As I’m following what Ueli is usually up to there wasn’t many new things in the keynote, though it was interesting to see the new videos and photos which are not available online. Just for that it would be worth it to visit it I say, and everyone I spoke to really enjoyed the keynote. After it was again a break where in addition to Joni &amp; Marko I also met <a href="https://twitter.com/korpijaakko">Jaakko</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/JuhoKnuuttila">Juho</a> and met also <a href="https://twitter.com/LauriHilander">Lauri</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/O_Hkkn">Olli</a> who will head to <a href="https://twitter.com/GD_FGE15">Greenland</a> this year and friends I met in last February at the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/abisko-ice-climbing-festival-2014.html">Abisko Ice Climbing Festival</a>. We chatted about future projects and adventures and had a good time chatching up, though then it was already time for the final movie of the night, Valley Uprising.</p>

<iframe src="http://hendrikmorkel.github.com//player.vimeo.com/video/101316261?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff" width="1200" height="675" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>This was my personal highlight of the night. I love climbing and Yosemite is one of the places I want to visit to climb. Getting the history served as an entertaining movie from when it started up to the people <a href="http://www.rockandice.com/lates-news/dawn-wall-update-caldwell-sends-last-5-14-pitch">climbing there today</a> it was a massively inspiring &amp; entertaining movie which will get you psyched to head to the valley. Very cool was the music in the movie, which you can listen to in the underneath Spotify Playlist. Again I’d recommend you watch this movie if you’re interested in climbing and Yosemite National Park or the history of rock climbing in Yosemite. You can watch it online on Vimeo above or head to one of the theaters where it’s still running =)</p>

<p>The Helsinki Adventure Night 2014 was a great event and if you life in Helsinki or close to it and want to meet like-minded people, watch inspiring movies and listen to a Keynote from top athelehes make sure to keep an eye out for the 2015 edition, I’m certain it will be as cool as the 2014 Edition =) <em>Many thanks to <a href="http://scarpa.it">Scarpa</a> and <a href="http://www.greendoor.fi">Greendoor</a> for inviting me to the Helsinki Adventure Night!</em></p>

Great locations, world-class climbers, superb weather and a beautiful country - so much to like!</p>

<p><strong>The Approach</strong> to Turkey was loooooong: Vaasa - Helsinki, Helsinki - Moscow, Moscow - Antalya, well over 14 hours of travelling. After I arrived I happily met <a href="http://vertical-axis.de">Nico</a> at the airport and after figuring out where to go we got into our ride to the Historic centre of Antalya. We stayed at the beautiful <a href="http://www.mediterraarthotel.com">Mediterra Art Hotel</a> which really was very comfy, even if I spent there less than 12 hours in total. I dropped my bags at the room and then headed for a tasty dinner high above the old harbour, where I also met my fellow Press members. It was a very mixed bunch and I was in esteemed company: Members from <a href="http://www.rockandice.com">Rock &amp; Ice</a>, <a href="http://www.grimper.com">Grimper</a>, <a href="http://desnivel.com">Desnivel</a>, <a href="http://outsideonline.se">Outside</a> and <a href="http://www.klettern.de">klettern</a> where there along with people from the <a href="http://www.climbing.fi/skil/">Finnish Climbing Association</a>, the <a href="http://www.clubalpin.be">Club Alpin Belge</a> and the <a href="http://www.nkbv.nl">NKBV</a> and several others. </p>

<h2 id="geyikbayiri">Geyikbayiri</h2>

<p>The next morning we took a short bus ride to Geyikbayırı, <em>THE</em> sport climbing spot. Imagine it like a spacious and very large natural amphitheatre and you get the idea of this place. Right in the centre is <a href="http://www.rockclimbingantalya.com">Kezban’s Guesthouse</a> where we dropped our bags and then headed to <a href="http://www.climbersgarden.com">Climber’s Garden</a> where we had lunch from the beautiful terrace, just a stone throw away from Kezban’s. We met Lafouche, the guy whose idea the RocTrip has been a long time ago and the only person who has been on each one, and <a href="http://www.maewan.com/en/">Erwan</a> who organizes it nowadays. </p>

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15590093364" title="Lunch at Climber&#x27;s Garden, Geyikbayiri by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7535/15590093364_cf04498380_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Lunch at Climber&#x27;s Garden, Geyikbayiri" /></a>

<p>Well, after a tasty meal it was finally time to hit the rock! We headed to the Trebenna Sector which was just a short stroll down a dirt road from Climber’s Garden. The sector is north-faced and so lay in the shade, and with temperatures which felt well into the high twenties that was certainly a good choice. Trebenna a good sector with routes from 5a to 8b+ so is ideal for all levels. I climbed a few easy routes with Anne, Piotr and Kristina but spend most of the time taking photos of the climbing that was going down. And there was lots of that!</p>

<p>After the climbing it was Party time! Delicious grilled Kebabs and local beer were consumed before the music at the trailer started. A big party of the RocTrip is music and so Lafouche, Said Belhaj, Sean Villanueva and a handful more of people got on the stage of the converted Airstream trailer and started to jam. People loved it and the party went on till the wee hours, with the music sounding through the natural amphitheatre of Geyikbayiri.</p>

<h2 id="citdibi">Citdibi</h2>

<p>Citdibi is the sector to visit if you climb 7a and harder. You also should have plenty of stamina, as with routes up to 150 m high, much of them on overhangs, you will get pumped. As I didn’t bother putting the climbing shoes on here I just took photos and enjoyed watching as a lot of world-class climbers like Nina Caprez, Jon Cardwell, Dave Graham and many more were enjoying themselves on the beautiful tufa routes on this beautiful limestone crag. The sector has a bit of a strenuous approach but going back down is easy.</p>

<p>If you want to climb at Citdibi for several days you can stay less than 15 minutes on foot away at the gorgeous <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/928318137182778/">Masal Refuge</a>. It’s a beautiful cabin with a superb view to the surrounding mountains, the Mediterranean Sea, Antalya and everything in between. You probably should get groceries down in the valley, though, as I saw no supermarket close by. </p>

<h2 id="olympos">Olympos</h2>

<p>We didn’t linger long at Citdibi and continued to Olympos at the sea. The ride there was adventurous to say the least and involved driving on a “Shortcut I think there possibly maybe might be” through the mountains. We arrived in the dark at the final Basecamp, <a href="http://kadirstreehouse.com">Kadir’s Treehouse</a>.It looks like a beautiful place, with the cottages being all aloft in the air, with a large main building in the middle where breakfast &amp; dinner was served. We did stay a tad down the road in the Kadir Family House, which was OK. I wouldn’t go there with my family, but if you’re a climber looking for a place to sleep and a hot shower then it’s OK. Don’t bother ‘bout the Wifi, though, that doesn’t work. And as we weren’t there for sleeping but climbing it was fine.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16177982506" title="Olympos Beach"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8615/16177982506_b4d1812246_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Olympos Beach" /></a>

<p>The climbing then. There’s a bunch of sectors at Olympos and from slabs to vertical and overhangs, from easy 5a’s to 8b+ you can find at least a dozen of routes per grade, with most of them in the 6 and 7 category. Sectors also are very varied, from a shady &amp; narrow valley over high caves close to the sea to walls which are more in the sun. But if you don’t have trouble walking some 20 to 30 minutes you always can find a sector that’s in the shade - or just go relax at the wonderful beach and visit the ruins. </p>

<p>We visited half a dozen sectors while we stayed in Olympos, but the highlight for me was the Deep Water Soloing. Being able to climb to your limit and then just drop into the water if you can’t anymore is such an excellent way to climb that I hope to do more DWS in 2015 and the future. It’s super fun and pretty much everyone enjoyed the experience, and if you ever get the possibility to try it you totally should. Just take (<a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/rock-technologies-liquid-chalk/?pid=81">liquid</a>) chalk and a small towel, your <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/06/scarpa-stix.html">climbing shoes</a> and a swim shorts/ suit and you’re set!</p>

<p>Also the other climbing at Olympos is great, and best of all is that it’s a very family friendly area. There’s dozens of accommodation options and the street to the National Park entry is lined with Cafés, Kiosks and small restaurants so you won’t starve or die of thirst. </p>

<h2 id="how-to-plan-your-own-climbing-trip-to-turkey">How to plan your own climbing trip to Turkey</h2>

<p>You wanna get the <a href="http://www.climb-europe.com/RockClimbingShop/Antalya-Sports-Climbing-Guidebook.html">A Rock Climbing Guide to Antalya</a> Guide book which covers all the areas mentioned in this post, and if you’re hooked on Turkey also get the <a href="http://www.climbtravel.com">Climb Travel Turkey</a> book. You can get them with some luck online, but for sure you will get them at any of the Guesthouses/ Camping places in Geyikbayiri and Olympos. Both have a host of information on all that you need to know for climbing there, from gear tips to accommodation, food and of course detailed topos. Online you can check out <a href="http://climbgeyikbayiri.com/?page_id=2">Climb Geyikbayiri</a> and <a href="http://www.olymposrockclimbing.com/?lang=en">Olympos Rock Climbing</a> for some information.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15594290283" title="A Rock Climbing Guide to Antalya &amp; Climb Travel Turkey books by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7548/15594290283_8eecfb50c4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="A Rock Climbing Guide to Antalya &amp; Climb Travel Turkey books" /></a></p>

<p>Flying into Antalya is the best option, unless you want to do your own road trip in Turkey. Getting around is easy &amp; cheap via bus or more independent with a rental car, the latter could be useful if you want to visit all three locations. But the bussess to Geyikbayiri and Olympos are regular, and many of the guest houses in Geyikbayiri also might offer a pick-up from the airport.</p>

<p>At Citdibi there’s only the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/928318137182778/">Masal Refuge</a> for overnight accommodation, but in Geyikbayiri and Olympos you can choose from several options. I liked <a href="http://www.rockclimbingantalya.com">Kezban’s Guesthouse</a> and <a href="http://www.climbersgarden.com">Climber’s Garden</a>, both had friendly staff, where short walks away from the crag and had beautiful gardens where you can pitch your tents, pick pomegranates and olives and chat with climbers from Turkey and the world. </p>

<p>The food in Turkey was delicious and I recommend you try the local cuisine. Just be careful with the veggies at Kadir’s Tree House, especially the salad: They’re washed with the unsafe tap water and there were many that got sick from it, so better avoid the raw, washed veggies unless you have a really strong stomach who is not bother by a few bacteria. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/16026622780" title="On the boat! by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7484/16026622780_15c67956ea_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="On the boat!" /></a></p>

<p>As for <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2011/08/ultralight-climbing.html">climbing gear</a>, a 60 or 70 m single rope and 12 to 18 quick-draws should have you covered for most sports routes. There are Trad routes around, but most of it is sports climbing so keep that in mind. A <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/petzl-sirocco-helmet.html">helmet</a> is recommended as there are overhangs and lose rock, especially at the sea-side sectors of Olympos. Don’t forget to take at least a 1 l bottle of water as it is hot and some snacks. </p>

<p>The best time to go seems to be between September and June, with the rainy season being in December/ January and the hot summer in July/ August. As there are a lot of caves and overhangs these still could be OK. </p>

<p><strong>Finally</strong>, if I’d go again there I’d likely would go to Olympos. It’s super family-friendly with the beach and the other activities offered there and could be a great place to base yourself for a week with plenty to climb and explore. On rest days you can explore the ruins, go hiking, swimming or take a boat for a little cruise around the area. In Olympos you also have a lot of nice Cafés and Restaurants where you can taste the local cuisine, which you really should =) If you like some partying, then that’s also possible there with live music et al! Olympos is also an host to a yearly climbing festival int he autumn, which would be good to check out if you’re in the area.</p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>I received the Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX over a year ago in November 2013. I climbed ice in Korouoma, Vaasa and <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/abisko-ice-climbing-festival-2014.html">Abisko</a> with them and was mountaineering in <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/07/arcteryx-alpine-academy-2014.html">Chamonix</a> and the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/mountaineering-and-climbing-in-the-polish-tatras.html">Polish Tatras</a>. All in all they have seen over four weeks of use and have been used for ice climbing, mountaineering and hiking.</p>

<h2 id="technical-innovations">Technical Innovations</h2>

<p>Again Ueli Steck has helped to develop this boot, and you can see it from the weight and the technical features. While the sock-gaiter-construction isn’t new I have not seen a lot of mountaineering boots which use it. The Y-Structure, KCN-Tech fabric and Re-Active AC XT sole stand out on this booth, as does the very good fit &amp; the light weight.</p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>The shoe is hand made in Italy and is from a quality point of view absolutely superb. The fit is impeccable and even after four weeks of hard use the boots still look like new. Only the reflective tape in the back of the shoe shoes some wear, otherwise boot and sole still look like new.</p>

<p>The boots are hand made in Italy. If you have worn it out you could have it resoled at your local shoemaker or you can recycle it via your local recycling scheme.</p>

<h2 id="in-use">In use</h2>

<p><strong>Ice &amp; Mixed climbing</strong> I did with the <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2013/04/grivel-g20-crampons.html">Grivel G20 crampons</a> to the boot and it’s a fantastic combination. The G20 are 424 g per crampon which means one shoe &amp; boot are 1197 g, which is about 150 g lighter than with the Phantom Ultra boots on. This might seem trivial but feels like a big difference. What I enjoy most with the Rebel Ultra GTX is, however, the freedom of movement my feet have in them. I can pretty much fully move my feet like I could in a trailrunner, with the difference that I can connect a pair of crampons to them and climb ice with them. This is especially useful for mixed climbing, but also on more tricky ice climbs in narrow places this freedom of movement helps in better foot placements. The high sock works like a gaiter &amp; keeps water and snow out and the carbon insert makes the sole nicely rigid for climbing. In short, the climbing in them is great, I really loved the freedom of movement they gave me. </p>

<p>The last winter was super mild and I wasn’t able to test the boots in severe cold weather, but the -5°C I used them in, often while standing around on snow and ice, where no problem for them and I had warm feet and toes in the boots. When constantly moving one might be able to wear them in even colder temperatures, say to -10°C, but beyond that I reckon they will be not warm enough and it’s better to put a warmer boot on. One option that I haven’t tried is using an overboot with them in colder weather for a little bit of extra insulation, though I almost think that just using a warmer boot would be lighter - though less versatile.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15864534166" title="Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX in Chamonix by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7496/15864534166_7c1da26c08_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX in Chamonix" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Hiking</strong> in these boots is possible but really wasn’t something I liked. While they allow great freedom of movement they are lined boots, so walking from the Chalet to the Cable Car in Chamonix, a 15 minutes walk, was not enjoyable as it was +35°C in the valley, which meant I had super-sweaty feet by the time I arrived at the house. In the Tatras I hiked on two occasions with the Rebel Ultra GTX boots, once in warm weather which again was not good, and once in the pouring rain, where they were fine. I had moist feet &amp; boots after hiking four hours in the rain in them, but they were warm so it was OK. They did also dry almost completely over night. However, when I know I need to hike long distances in the summer I would always take my <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/08/luna-sandals-oso.html">Luna Sandals OSO</a> along for it, as I much prefer to hike in warm weather in them.</p>

<p><strong>Mountaineering</strong> in the Alps and Tatras I did most of the time with the <a href="http://www.bergzeit.de/grivel-air-tech-new-matic-steigeisen/?pid=81">Grivel Air Tech New-Matic</a> (453 g per crampon) but I also tried the <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/camp-xlc-390-steigeisen/">CAMP XLC 390</a> (254 g incl. optional Antibot). The weight difference between these two crampons is almost 200 g so not trivial. I did climb more with the Grivel Air Tech New-Matics and do like them a lot, and these two crampons show that you can use the Rebel Ultra with either a plastic harness or a front bale. The light weight and freedom of movement of the boot of course are great for alpine climbs and the sole is sticky on rock and allows for precise foot placements. I still would switch to <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/06/scarpa-stix.html">climbing shoes</a> for more demanding/ technical climbs, but if it are easy routes you’re doing the Rebel Ultra GTX are more than capable. Add in good grip on snow &amp; ice and you have a very efficient mountaineering boot.</p>

<h2 id="competing-products">Competing Products</h2>

<p>The <a href="">Scarpa Phantom Ultra</a> is a warmer and heavier boot which might attract the same people who’re curious about the Rebel Ultra GTX. If we look at other brands the <a href="http://bit.ly/1xAiXwT">La Sportiva Trango Cube GTX</a> and the <a href="http://bit.ly/1AhNGww">La Sportiva Batura 2.0 GTX</a> are both lightweight mountaineering boots which can be used for the same activities as the Rebel Ultra GTX.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15889670892" title="Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7471/15889670892_4fe3a5cbc6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX" /></a></p>

<h2 id="could-be-better">Could be better</h2>

<p>I’m hard-pressed to come up with something that could be better in this boot. I am sure Scarpa and Ueli had their reasons to use Gore-Tex® instead of OutDry® for this shoe, personally I feel OutDry® is slightly better at keeping moisture out, dries faster and breathes better, but I think the Gore-Tex® lining does a good job in this boot. So really nothing to complain.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15890337425" title="Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX with Grivel G20 Crampons attached by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7497/15890337425_9735b0f75f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX with Grivel G20 Crampons attached" /></a></p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>The Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX is a beautiful <em>and</em> ultralight mountaineering boot that is excellent for early and late season ice &amp; mixed climbing and summer mountaineering. It keeps your feet &amp; toes warm till at least -5°C even if you’re just standing around in the snow or hang in the belay, and with the Vibram® sole it is also well suited for easy alpine climbs. I think if you look to up your ice, mixed and alpine climbing by shedding weight and going lighter the Rebel Ultra GTX is the right boot for you. I love my pair and am always happy to put them on, because I know a good day in the outdoors lies ahead of me with them on my feet.</p>

    <updated>2015-01-02T12:12:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://hendrikmorkel.github.com/2015/01/alan-hinkes-8000-meters</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You’ve probably seen a trend in my <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/books/">book reviews</a> in the last years: They’ve been more and more about mountaineering and climbing. Why that is so I’ll explain at another time, but now I want to take you along and tell you about the latest book I have read, <em>8000 Metres - Climbing the World’s Highest Mountains by Alan Hinkes</em>. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15985413000" title="Alan Hinkes: 8000 Metres - Climbing the World&#x27;s highest Mountains by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8658/15985413000_e521caa7ac_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Alan Hinkes: 8000 Metres - Climbing the World&#x27;s highest Mountains" /></a></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>There’s 14 8.000 m peaks on this planet and Alan Hinkes is the first British Mountaineer to have successfully summited all fourteen of them. In his splendid coffee table book “<a href="http://www.cicerone.co.uk/product/detail.cfm/book/548/tab/detail/iid/1/show/description#.VKZk6cbvR_0">8000 Meters - Climbing the World’s highest Mountains</a>” he tells the stories and shares his fantastic photos with the reader. Its a chronological layout and after a Foreword, Preface and Introduction we start at Alan’s first 8.000 m summit, Shisha Pangma, which he climbed in 1987. </p>

<p>From that year one Alan has been almost every season in the Himalayas and Karakoram on a quest to climb 8.000 m peaks, even if climbing all 14 of them wasn’t something that he set out to from the start. His writing style is very enjoyable: Honest, down-to-earth and lacking hyperboles which easily could sneak itself in when writing about climbing the highest peaks on the planet. The thoughtful texts describe the experiences of climbing the high mountains, what kind of mental and physical difficulties one can face, from the waiting game in base camp while sitting out bad weather and passing frozen corpses high on the mountains to climbing difficulties and getting up and down these peaks.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/15986690559" title="Alan Hinkes: 8000 Metres - Climbing the World&#x27;s highest Mountains by Hendrik Morkel, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7463/15986690559_90c9064a27_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Alan Hinkes: 8000 Metres - Climbing the World &#x27;s highest Mountains" /></a></p>

<p>Alan’s climbing Motto is <em>“No mountain is worth a life, coming back is a success and the summit is only a bonus”</em> and throughout the book he also highlights the importance to have enough power reserves for the descent. What happens if you don’t have these Alan has seen in his friends on some expeditions, which burned themselves out on the ascent and then had no energy left for the descent, which often is even more dangerous than going up. </p>

<p>In between chapers there are small anecdotes from Alan’s encounters with fellow mountaineers like Reinhold Messner and Jerzy Kukuczka or the Trek-Ins to base camps and local cuisine. These loosen up the already enjoyable peak stories. A real highlight for me are the fantastic photos Alan has shot during his ascents and from his travels to these two mountain ranges. The photos were shot before the rise of automatic digital cameras and so one needed to know how to adjust ISO, Aperture and Shutter Speed to get great results, and the photos in this book are proof that Alan knows his trade. I have spent a lot of time just browsing the photos, tracing the lines described in the texts to the summit, and enjoy the vast views which you can have when standing on the top of the world. </p>

<p><em>8000 Metres - Climbing the World’s highest Mountains</em> is a highly enjoyable book that shouldn’t be missing on your bookshelf if you like mountaineering, alpinism and are dreaming of the highest peaks of the planet. The honest &amp; evocative writing is on par with the superb images in the book, and if you ever hope to stand on top of a 8.000 m peak you will do well to read Alan’s book and follow his Motto!</p>

<p>Get the book at your local bookshop, directly from <a href="http://www.cicerone.co.uk/product/detail.cfm/book/548/title/8000-metres#.VKZejsbvR_0">Cicerone</a> or from <a href="http://amzn.to/1wIIMnr">Amazon.de</a>, <a href="http://amzn.to/1xzM7fy">Amazon.com</a> and <a href="http://amzn.to/1yehuvP">Amazon.co.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>it’s quite convenient that you are at home in Finland, that way you don’t have such a long trip to me. However, <a href="http://arcteryx.com/">Arc’teryx</a> is at home in North Vancouver in Canada - so almost on the other side of the globe from us, so I just hope you have time to pick up the present I ask you for still! It is well-known that they make some of the best outdoor garments and climbing gear that’s available - I love each piece of my <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/blog/categories/arc-teryx/">Arc’teryx gear</a>. Two years ago they launched their Down garments and I desire a <a href="http://arcteryx.com/product.aspx?language=EN&amp;gender=Mens&amp;category=Insulated_Jackets&amp;model=Cerium-LT-Hoody">Cerium LT Hoody</a> this Christmas, it’d be perfect for my ultralight adventure next weekend. Made of high-quality Coreloft™ synthetic insulation in the hem, collar, sleeves &amp; underarms and 850 fill goose down is in the torso and sleeves - this Down Composite Mapping strategically places Coreloft™ synthetic insulation in areas where moisture may buildup and down in areas for maximum warmth! It is a great jacket in cool and dry conditions or as a Midlayer, has a toasty hood and the best part is that it’s a mere 255 g heavy! Santa, this is the last gear gift I ask from you this year, so please leave one under the tree for me!</p>

<p>Merry Christmas!</p>

<p>Querido Santa,</p>

<p>no sleeping bag can be as functional and versatile as a quilt, and that’s why Ultralight Backpackers from North to South and East to West swear on them. The <a href="http://astucas.com/en/products/sestrals-blanket">Sestrals Blanket</a> from the Spanish cottage manufacturer <a href="http://astucas.com">As Tucas</a> is such a wonderful quilt, but where others use down for insulation the Sestrals uses the synthetic Climashield insulation material. It has a great warmth-to-weight ratio and keeps one warm even if it gets moist from condensation or when the drybag wasn’t that waterproof after all. The Sestrals is ideal as a blanket on Mountain Huts or warm summer nights but if it gets fresh on higher altitudes you can close up the footbox and wrap it nicely around your neck and shoulders for a toasty night in the hills. It’s fully customizable and even can be used as an over quilt to boost another quilt’s rating - ideal for winter camping! As I’m still missing a synthetic quilt in my quiver, please bring me a Sestrals Blanket from Spain, Santa!</p>

<p>Sincerely yours,</p>

<p>The Ultralighter</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>I know I can be hard to please. I seek perfection in my equipment, which is why I often use a <a href="http://katabaticgear.com/">Katabatic Gear</a> quilt. Imagine my surprise as they announced that they will be making backpacks, too! Over two years in the development they launched this autumn, and I think the <a href="http://katabaticgear.com/shop/helios-55-backpack/">Helios 55 backpack</a> with its ventilated backpanel would be a great year-around backpack. Spacious enough to carry winter gear for a long weekend and comfortable enough to take along for a week in the Canyons of Utah, this pack could be the one to rule them all. It is Made in Colorado from a polyester film/ dyneema laminate which means it is super durable and highly water-resistant, and in a Medium Size it’s a light 888 g. I promise you Santa, this will be the last backpack I ask from you!</p>

<p>Sincerely yours,</p>

<p>The Ultralighter</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p><a href="http://rojksuperwear.com/en/">Röjk</a> knows something about functional designs, great colours and PrimaLoft Polyester yarns. Combine these yarns with Merino wool and you get a baselayer which has the best properties from the worlds of synthetic and natural materials. As I have a baselayer for each work day of the week I thought to ask you to bring one <a href="http://rojksuperwear.com/en/chicks/primaloft-superbase-sweater-berry-boost.html">PrimaLoft SuperBase Sweater</a>, a pair of <a href="http://rojksuperwear.com/en/chicks/primaloft-superbase-longlongs-berry-boost.html">PrimaLoft SuperBase LongLongs</a> and a warm pair of <a href="http://rojksuperwear.com/en/footgloves/primaloft-skier-mid-weight-berry-stripe.html">PrimaLoft Skier Mid-Weight</a> socks for my partner. Sharing outdoor times with a loved one make them a lot better and when the temperatures get cold, the Northern Lights dance through the sky and you’re standing shivering under the starry sky - that ain’t fun. But put a Röjk SuperBase baselayer and socks on and it’s the fantastic experince it should be. Thus, dear Santa, so I’m able to share these experiences with my partner, please bring her the PrimaLoft SuperBase Seater, PrimaLoft SuperBase LongLongs and Skier Socks so we can stand toegther in awe under the Northern Lights!</p>

<p>Sincerely yours,</p>

<p>The Ultralighter</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>All this talk of snow, winter, summer, Italy et al. makes me recall the good times I had this <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/07/pack-sail-rafting-in-the-kvarken-archipelago.html">summer packrafting</a> right here at home in the Kvarken Archipelago. Sometimes the good things are right in front of your nose. And as there’s plenty of rivers right here - and of course the Baltic Sea! - I was thinking some winter packrafting might be in order next weekend. It’s a good thing the <a href="http://www.packrafting-store.eu/">Packrafting Store</a> has their line of <a href="http://www.packrafting-store.de/advanced_search_result.php?keywords=Anfibio+made&amp;x=-442&amp;y=-246">Anfibio</a> gear, some great accessories for packrafting and backpacking. I was thinking you might want to bring me an <a href="http://www.packrafting-store.de/Christmas-Sale/Anfibio-Multibag-40l::549.html">Anfibio Multibag</a> to keep my spare clothes dry, an <a href="http://www.packrafting-store.de/Safety/Anfibio-Throwbag::415.html">Anfibio Throwbag</a> in case I need to rescue my partner and an <a href="http://www.packrafting-store.de/Raftpacks/Anfibio-Mobile-case::550.html">Anfibio Mobile Case</a> so my phone stays dry in the cold and wet environment. It’s all for safety and multi-use, and also will see action when I’m out backpacking. With that my winter packrafting adventure should be safe &amp; fun - exactly how it should be!</p>

<p>Sincerely yours,</p>

<p>The Ultralighter</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>the <a href="http://skinbased.com">skinbased</a> skis from <a href="http://www.oacsport.fi">OAC Sport</a> are a combination of a Nordic backcountry ski, a telemark/ touring ski and a snowshoe - which means they’re faster than snowshoes and easier to learn than normal skis. I came to the conclusion that for my backcountry adventures the <a href="http://skinbased.com/7/">KAR 147</a> would be ideal. It’s a wide and short ski, with a tip that always stays on top of the snow and on the way down it also has good edge control in packed snow. It’s agile when skiing and skinning up through forests - and fast! It’s so much faster than walking with snowshoes, and not just on the way up - on the way down you can have a lot of fun while making your turns and then establish the basecamp! Really great is the new OAC EA Binding: You can use it with almost any shoe or boot, which makes it ideal for winter skiing beginners as you can use your normal hiking boots and don’t need to get skiing boots. With these under my feet, Santa, I think I am ready for winter backpacking trips in the snow!</p>

<p>Sincerely yours,</p>

<p>The Ultralighter</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>I have been pondering backpacks yet again. I know, I know, but December I am at home while the rest of the year I’m out on the trail, so now’s the time to plan &amp; think. So, winter backpacking. I don’t really need a super-large volume backpack - between 40 and 50 l would be sufficient, though it should carry loads between 10 and 15 kg well. Which brought me to <a href="http://www.elementalhorizons.com">Elemental Horizons</a> and especially their acclaimed <a href="http://www.elementalhorizons.com/aquilo-pack.aspx">Aquilo backpack</a>. It has a roll-top closure, side pockets, an internal sleeping pad pocket that holds my pad securely and helps with weight distribution and finally: A padded harness with ergonomically shaped padded shoulder straps for comfortbale carries in the backcountry when I’m out with those new skis! It’s also a super durable backpack and I’m sure I can pass this on to my son when he’s older, so it really is a present for him that I’m just breaking in =)</p>

<p>Sincerely yours,</p>

<p>The Ultralighter</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p><a href="http://www.enlightenedequipment.com">Enlightened Equipment</a> makes their <a href="http://hikinginfinland.com/2014/03/enlightened-equipment-revelation-quilts.html">Revelation quilts</a> in so many different colours and temperature ratings that it’s hard to decide which one to wish for. Should it be for summer? Spring and autumn? Nope, it’s winter, and that’s why I’d like a <a href="http://www.enlightenedequipment.com/revelation/">Revelation 20°</a> quilt! Summer seems far off, and who knows - thanks to Climate Change it actually might never return and we’d be stuck with a perpetual winter. Thus better to have a warm down quilt like the Revelation, which with its 800 cuin DownTek Goose Down filling has a pretty good water and humidity resistance. The shape of the quilt also is adaptable - from completely open and flat to a closed footbox and drawcord on top, it adapts to my needs just as the weather and temperatures demand. With this quilt, Santa, winter really can come!</p>

<p>Sincerely yours,</p>

<p>The Ultralighter</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>Hong Kong is probably not a destination you’d think of when pondering about outdoor cities. But that’s exactly the city where <a href="http://store.picharpak.com">Picharpak Workshop</a> is at home, and let me tell you that they have some beautiful nature outside of the city where one can go hiking &amp; camping. It’s thus no surprise that Picharpak Workshop is making some great outdoor gear, and high on the list of any Ultralighter is their <a href="http://store.picharpak.com/index.php?route=product/product&amp;path=59&amp;product_id=55">1P Tarp L</a>. The beauty of this tarp is that it’s completely customizable and you can choose all colours of the tarp and edges and even the guylines and what kind of cleats you want to use! It also packs small and weighs just 273 g with everything and the pack sack. This tarp would bring colour to my nights in Italy, so please drop one into my stocking this Christmas!</p>

<p>Sincerely yours,</p>

<p>The Ultralighter</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>For that Italy hike I mentioned yesterday, I was thinking a true ultralighter probably would use a real summer quilt. So after browsing the <a href="http://www.jacksrbetter.com/quilt-comparison-chart/">Quilt Comparison Chart</a> on the <a href="http://www.jacksrbetter.com">Jacks ‘R’ Better</a> website I came to the conclusion that I should ask you for a <a href="http://www.jacksrbetter.com/shop/sierra-stealth/">Sierra Stealth</a> quilt. It uses 800 cuin Fillpower Active-dri Down, which has a hydrophobic down treatment that keeps the down drier - great for those evenings and nights where the temperatures drop fast in the mountains and condensation happens. It also has a re-sealable head hole which allows me to use the quilt as a serape - allowing me to leave the down jacket at home and making the quilt really a multi-purpose item. I’m certain that with this fine quilt I’d be the lightest hiker on the trail, Santa, so please bring it to me!</p>

<p>Sincerely yours,</p>

<p>The Ultralighter</p>
