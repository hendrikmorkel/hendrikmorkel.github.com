<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24206814663/in/dateposted/" title="DPS Skis"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1504/24206814663_e6bd50e421_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="DPS Skis" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><em>Disclaimer: I paid everything myself to visit the ISPO, so actually there’s nothing to disclose here. Except, possibly maybe, that one beer I drunk at Arc’teryx.</em></p>

<p>For starters read <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2016/02/ispo-2016-news-i.html">ISPO News Part I</a>.</p>

<h2 id="petzl">Petzl</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.petzl.com">Petzl</a> is hands-down my favourite climbing gear manufacturer so a stop at their booth is mandatory. The big news from them was something that made me as an ultralight backpacker and an aspiring ski-mountaineer very happy: An ultralight SkiMo kit that weighs in at 2 kg! </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24740315931/in/dateposted/" title="Petzl Fast &amp; Light SkiMo Gear"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1588/24740315931_e7cedf4f6a_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Petzl Fast &amp; Light SkiMo Gear" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The kit starts off with the Altitude Harness, which uses the WIREFRAME Technology to put the weight down to 150 g! You can put it on without taking your skis or crampons off as I tried on the fair, and it packs very small. It is a minimalist mountaineering/ ski harness so ideal if you traverse a glacier or rappel down a couloir. It packs small, will cost around 70€ and is available from July 2016 (!) onwards.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24205648674/in/dateposted/" title="Petzl Altitude Harness 3"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1546/24205648674_0297af33e5_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Petzl Altitude Harness 3" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Leopard LLF is a ten point crampon that weighs 330 g for the pair! The CORD-TEC flexible linking system reduces crampon volume and yes, I asked about the durability of these cords: <em>“Prototypes have been used for over a year now and yet a cord needs to break.”</em> After all you’re gonna walk on snow with these, so there’s not really much chances of the cord getting broken - unlike if you use them on sharp rock. The pack really small, are easy to put on your boot and the sizes can be adjusted in seconds by putting the cord over the hooks in the back part. They will also be in July 2016 in the shops and cost 116€.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24833818525/in/dateposted/" title="Petzl Leopard LLF Crampon"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1681/24833818525_90767efc46_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Petzl Leopard LLF Crampon" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><em>“Now we just need an ice axe for skiers”</em> you might think, but Petzl thought this also and hence you’ll be able to buy the Ride ice axe in July for 80€. The axe is 45 cm long, a length which makes it easy to attach to backpacks or even carry them inside of a larger pack, and it weighs 240 g. The pick is made from steel and is 3 mm thick at the front so will penetrate ice well. It has a slight curve in the Type 1 shaft and felt good in my hand and is compatible with the <a href="https://www.bergzeit.de/petzl-linkin-handschlaufe/?pid=81">Petzl LINKIN Leash</a>.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24833813565/in/dateposted/" title="Petzl Ride Ice Axe"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1521/24833813565_4787161c04_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Petzl Ride Ice Axe" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The RAD Line was previously only available as part of the <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/petzl-rad-system-spaltenbergungsset/?pid=10239">RAD System</a>, but July 2016 onwards you can buy the very light 60 m rope for 180€ also on its own. At 22 g per meter it is a great choice for glacier travel &amp; rescue as well as rappelling. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24205611464/in/dateposted/" title="Petzl RAD Line 2"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1492/24205611464_a94c2af985_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Petzl RAD Line 2" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>That was the climbing and mountaineering side of things, onwards to Lightning. There is coming a free MyPetzl Light mobile app for REACTIK+ and NAO+ connected headlamps in July to the Apple and Android Stores, which will work with the two named models, via Bluetooth. The Bluetooth is supposed to be low in energy consumption, and allows you to control the Headlamp via your phone in the same way you’re already now able to control the Nao via the Software on your computer. It sounds pretty good to be able to tell your headlamp for example that you will be out for six hours and hence want the optimal output over that period of time, all controlled from your phone. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24717705172/in/dateposted/" title="MyPetzl Light 1"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1576/24717705172_8665d394f5_b.jpg" width="576" height="1024" alt="MyPetzl Light 1" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24742106331/in/dateposted/" title="MyPetzl Light 2"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1479/24742106331_ce3620cb28_b.jpg" width="576" height="1024" alt="MyPetzl Light 2" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The two compatible headlamps are the Reactik+ and the Nao+. The latter will come with 750 Lumen and the former with 300 Lumen. The Nao will weigh 185 g, has a removable battery pack in the back which also has a read light so you’re seen from behind, and will cost 160€ once it comes out in October 2016. The Reactik+ will be 115 g light, costs 90€ and will already be available in July 2016.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24740320561/in/dateposted/" title="Petzl Reactik+"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1508/24740320561_2b68518e8b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Petzl Reactik+" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24715967912/in/dateposted/" title="Petzl Nao+"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1631/24715967912_6c858ed594_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Petzl Nao+" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="pieps">PIEPS</h2>

<p>This was my first visit at <a href="http://www.pieps.com">PIEPS</a>, the Austrian company specializing in Avalanche security gear. They presented their brand-new PIEPS MICRO, their smallest and lightest 3-antenna-beacon which comes with sensor technology and an app-controlled device management via Bluetooth. It has a big display for easy readability and a sensor which puts it automatically into search mode if you take it out of the holster. It’s 150 g light and has a size of 102 x 71 x 18 mm which makes it right now the smallest avalanche beacon on the market. It has a circular receiving range of 40 m which is a bit less than other 3-antenna beacons, but that’s not too big of a drawback. It will cost 350€.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24715994202/in/dateposted/" title="Pieps"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1691/24715994202_9558c585c5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Pieps" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24206995643/in/dateposted/" title="Pieps Micro"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1610/24206995643_855ce7c011_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Pieps Micro" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The iPROBE II is the second generation of the iProbe, 350 g light and 22 cm long. The fully automatic electronic avalanche probe enables peers to be rescued even more quickly with its acoustic and visual hit indicator, which saves time &amp; reduces misinterpretations while pinpointing a buried friend. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24807579896/in/dateposted/" title="Pieps iProbe 2"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1585/24807579896_d8c387350e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Pieps iProbe 2" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Shovel C’s selling point is it’s C handle, which is easy to grip even with fat mitts on - unlike a T-handle. It’s comes in two weights: 660 g and 720 g, with a telescope shaft which is 88 cm and 90 cm long respectively. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24807591256/in/dateposted/" title="Pieps Shovel C"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1535/24807591256_760ecbc1b8_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Pieps Shovel C" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="patagonia">Patagonia</h2>

<p>There were three big news from <a href="http://bit.ly/1vVr6Wj">Patagonia</a>, but their Worn Wear campaign on the booth certainly was most interesting. There’s going to be a Worn Wear Campaign in Europe where a team of sewers will travel the continent and fix your broken Patagonia garments, so if you want something repaired keep an eye out for it on their website. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24206849183/in/dateposted/" title="DIY Repair Guide"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1657/24206849183_d646986eb8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="DIY Repair Guide" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24833700525/in/dateposted/" title="Fix it!"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1588/24833700525_b7b74283c1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Fix it!" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Then there’s the Patagonia exclusive PrimaLoft Gold Insulation Eco, a synthetic insulation made from 55% recycled content with 100% performance of normal Primaloft. PrimaLoft themselves were so positive about this new insulation material that they committed to replace all their PrimaLoft® Gold Insulation with PrimaLoft Gold Insulation Eco beginning in 2017! All Patagonia Nano Puff® styles - Vest, Pullover, Jacket and Hoody - come in Fall 2016 with the 60-g PrimaLoft® Gold Insulation Eco. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24206866613/in/dateposted/" title="Patagonia Nano Puff Revolution"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1513/24206866613_9e94de0f1d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Patagonia Nano Puff Revolution" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24715847122/in/dateposted/" title="Patagonia Nano Puff Ingredients"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1470/24715847122_fecb658d93_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Patagonia Nano Puff Ingredients" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The second big news was the 100% recycled down. The 600 fill power goose and duck down is reclaimed from used items that can’t be resold and offers identical performance to virgin down. The first garments to use the material are the more urban-styled Bivy Down Jackets &amp; Vests, the M’s Down Snap-T® Pullover and the Down Shirts which could work well for backpacking and camping. No info on weights, sorry, prices go from 200€ to 250€ for these pieces.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24833771185/in/dateposted/" title="Patagonia Recycled Down"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1591/24833771185_c27a475bb4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Patagonia Recycled Down" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And then the technical Alpine gear. The Stretch Nano Storm Jacket I’m wearing underneath is the <a href="http://bit.ly/20M5T2i">Nano Air Hoody</a> wrapped into a H2No Performance Standard shell fabric, creating a jacket which keeps the elements at bay when you climb and while you belay your mate in a blizzard - no more need to pull on a belay parka with this one on. It will cost 470€, again sadly no infos on weights (but it wasn’t light). </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24807500156/in/dateposted/" title="Patagonia"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1599/24807500156_6228ef5da4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Patagonia" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="ortovox">ORTOVOX</h2>

<p><a href="http://ortovox.com">ORTOVOX</a> News coming in a wee bit!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24807370916/in/dateposted/" title="ORTOVOX Avabag &amp; Backpacks"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1447/24807370916_1c488efc66_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="ORTOVOX Avabag &amp; Backpacks" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="dps-skis">DPS Skis</h2>

<p>I do like my <a href="http://www.dpsskis.com">DPS Skis</a> skis so I scheduled a visit at their booth to see what’s coming next winter from this innovative ski maker. Brand-new next season is their Foundation Line pictured underneath, which uses best-in-class components to create a durable and long-lasting ski. From Polyamide topsheets over a bamboo and poplar core to a graphite race base, the Foundation skis should suit a wide variety of skiers. Benefits of the Foundation skis include effortless turn initiation, a solid and powerful drivefrom mid-turn to exit and taht the skis throughout the line feel familiar if you belong to those people who need more than one pair of skis.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24564799671/in/dateposted/" title="DPS Skis Foundation Line Skis"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1504/24564799671_e760f4a422_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="DPS Skis Foundation Line Skis" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>But I was more interested in the new Tour1 models. Tour1 is DPS’ backcountry/ ski-touring build of skis which are very light but have great downhill performance - fast up and fun on the way to the valley. The (green) Cassier 87 is the ultralight ski for fast ascents as it fits into thin skintracks and weighs just 1340 g at 178 cm length. At 121/ 87/ 109 it still offers good all-snow and all-mountain performance, for fun days out on the hills.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24740258271/in/dateposted/" title="DPS Skis Tour1 Skis"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1454/24740258271_02c432cf2a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="DPS Skis Tour1 Skis" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24538223670/in/dateposted/" title="DPS Skis Tour1 Cassier 87"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1542/24538223670_3dcc705fd9_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="DPS Skis Tour1 Cassier 87" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The (blue) Wailer 106 is also new, weighs 1.440 g at 178 cm length and has the fine measurements of 133/ 106/ 122. DPS suggests this ski as your one ski if you life in a region which sees consitent snow, measured in centimeters and not meters, as it fits well into the skin track and delivers broad pleasures and predicable precision with its Chassis-driven rocker &amp; sidecut design.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24833749245/in/dateposted/" title="DPS Skis Tour 1 Wailer 106"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1620/24833749245_3e0bbc75e4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="DPS Skis Tour 1 Wailer 106" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And then there’s the beautiful Tour1 Zelda 106 ski in awesome purple for Women. It weighs 1.340 g in 168 cm length and a bit less in 158 cm length. A ski for ladies who are out already with the first snow in late November and will first leave the mountains in June when even on Lyngen the last snow is melting away, the Zelda 106 should be a great touring skis. Did I mention that I love the colour? Good.</p>

<h2 id="spark-rd">Spark R&amp;D</h2>

<p>Splitboarding? Yes! And whom better to visit than <a href="http://www.sparkrandd.com">Spark R&amp;D</a>, who celebrate their 10 year anniversary this year - congratulations! In case you’re now pondering what Splitboarding is - well, it’s a Snowboard broken down in the middle so that you can skin up the mountain with it - as with skis - and then you put it back together and snowboard down the hill. Their Tesla T1 Binding System has won numerous awards and the Surge binding underneath is Spark’s binding for big lines. They’re not new but have updated colours for the next season.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24205723804/in/dateposted/" title="Spark R&amp;D Bindings"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1442/24205723804_a0ee7888d0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Spark R&amp;D Bindings" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>As Splitborders also go up steep pointy bits a crampon like the Ibex is useful to get more grip. Available in different widths and compatible with the bindings.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24205728764/in/dateposted/" title="Spark R&amp;D Crampon"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1573/24205728764_736702f168_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Spark R&amp;D Crampon" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Dyno DH is Spark’s Splitboard binding for hardboots - think <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/12/arcteryx-procline-carbon-lite-ski-boot.html">Arc’teryx Procline</a> and similar. Tour up with normal front pieces for touring up, then slide the Dyno DH on the pucks and you’re ready to snowboard down with your hardboots. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24205793984/in/dateposted/" title="Spark R&amp;D Dyno DH 2"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1548/24205793984_2eccf32b12_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Spark R&amp;D Dyno DH 2" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>New from Spark is the Zip Strap underneath, which increases the glide on flat and low angled terrain. It covers the skin with a slippery plastic film which allows you to feel like you’re on cross country skis and move faster, all without needing to take the skins off. When not needed it rolls up to a tiny package.</p>

<p>The Splitboard skins from Spark are made by G3 and come with the Spark Tailclips which attach great to your Splitboard in touring mode. For the next season they got a new look, otherwise they’re just as great as they have been.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My last visit to <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/11/bouldering-on-aland.html">Åland</a> took me there in the golden autumn when I went bouldering &amp; exploring the island and it’s beautiful forests, bays and islands. This year I returned to Åland in the depth of winter to go skiing, drink beer at the Stallhagen Microbrewery and meet the Krokodil Dundee of Ahvenanmaa as part of the <a href="http://www.nbe.fi">Nordic Blogger Experience</a>.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24497045390/in/dateposted/" title="Åland &lt;3"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1589/24497045390_843de23e41_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Åland &lt;3" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The last time on Åland I was host to my bouldering friends from Germany, a role I would take on yet again this time around - but happily I had the help of Henriikka of <a href="http://aamukahvilla.fi">Aamukahvilla</a> fame who would with me together host eight fellow bloggers: Alizé and Max of <a href="http://detourlocal.com">Detour Local</a>, Alice and Alessandro from <a href="http://www.agipsyinthekitchen.com">A Gipsy in the Kitchen</a>, Aleksandra from <a href="http://duze-podroze.pl">Duże Podróże</a>, Sara aka <a href="http://www.thisgirlloves.co.uk">This Girl Loves</a>, Lee who writes for <a href="http://ab-road.co.kr">Ab-Road</a> and <a href="http://blog.naver.com/s1h25s">Hyesun</a>. Together we were ten bloggers from eight countries, with one thing in common: The love for travelling. And travelling we would on this trip.</p>

<p>Meeting up with each other in Helsinki to catch the ferry to Mariehamn proved to be no problem, and together we boarded the <a href="http://www.vikingline.fi/?gclid=CNi5s9nY28oCFQsEwwodZrsEfw">Viking Line</a> ferry. After throwing our luggage into our cabins we proceeded to the Viking Buffet, a time-limited all-you-can-eat-and-drink feast. We had the company of a group of fellow NBE Bloggers who were setting over to Stockholm and so after we filled our bellies with salmon, salad and desserts we went on to show our foreign friends what the ferry experience all includes. Or we would have, if we wouldn’t have to get up at 4:00 o’clock to get off the boat in Mariehamn! Two Taxis whisked us to <a href="http://www.alandhotels.fi/en/hotel-pommern">Hotel Pommern</a> and after a few more hours of sleep it was time for our first day on Åland and exploring it with its winter gown on.</p>

<p>Like the rest of Finland also Åland had gotten a great layer of snow, and so we went to cross-country ski in Jomala. A freshly groomed track lead around the soccer field, but after a few circles around the field we became more adventurous and headed out on the 2 km long loipe through the forest. Small hills made for fun rides down, and the forest in its white snow cover was a much better representation of what cross-country skiing is all about: Experiencing the forest on skis with only a light breeze in the tree tops and the song of birds. Sadly our schedule already called for the next activity, so we skied back to the sports hall, put on our shoes and then went on to the Café Uffe på Berget Watchtower - a tower I already wanted to climb on my last visit. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24792276975/in/dateposted/" title="All along the watchtower"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1511/24792276975_584aba0a05_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="All along the watchtower" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>On the top a cold breeze and wide views welcomed us, and after a few photos we headed onwards to Kastelholm Castle. Sadly it was closed so we only were able to admire it from the outside, but if you like castles then this should definitely be on your list when visiting Åland (but then in summer, when it is open!). All this skiing &amp; sight-seeing made us hungry so a visit to <a href="http://www.dinosbar.com">Dinos Bar &amp; Grill</a> was in order. Tasty burgers and local beers put the energy levels high again, high enough to meet the local newspapers which wanted to interview some of us at the Ålands Sjöfarts Museum. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://sjofartsmuseum.ax/">Ålands Sjöfarts Museum</a> is a Museum worth a visit, even if you’re not a sea-faring captain who has sailed on all seven seas. It’s a touch &amp; try Museum, and you can climb the rigging inside, enter the original, reconstructed Captain’s quarters and learn about sea-faring back in the day. It is also home to one of only two original Pirate flags in the world, <em>YARR!</em> - and in the cellar there are three more exhibitions which will be interesting for small and big sailors alike.</p>

<p>After such a full programme there where two essential things left to do today: Relax in the sauna at the <a href="http://www.mariehamn.ax/idrott-fritid/idrottsanlaggningar/mariebad/">Badhuset Mariebad</a> and then have a tasty Dinner at the <a href="http://www.stallhagen.com/en/">Stallhagen Brewery</a>. After all the cold activities outside it was wonderful to relax in a warm sauna, chat with the new friends and go for a swim in the pool. Sadly Sauna time always goes over way too fast, but as we were hungry and the Chefs at Stallhagen were cooking tasty food for us, it wasn’t too difficult to leave. Plus, the Stallhagen beers are pretty good and if you’re a beer enthusiast then you’ll want to plan in a visit at this fine establishment.</p>

<h2 id="to-the-outer-reaches-a-visit-to-jurmo">To the Outer Reaches: A visit to Jurmo</h2>

<p>Monday morning started early as we travelled to Jurmo, Brändö, an island which is a mere 30 minutes by ferry from Kustavi on Mainland Finland - bu a nearly five our oneway trip from Mariehamn. Taxi, ferry, Taxi, ferry, and a Quad-Taxi would bring us far, far away from the capital of the Åland islands. </p>

<p>On Jurmo live around 25 people, and its a place where you can see what happens when old people die and young people move to the city: There’s silence. Closed window shutters. No traffic. You make the first tracks out in the forest and on the ice. A place where neighbours know, and help each other.</p>

<p>Our guide on the small island of Jurmo was <a href="http://www.brando.ax/fi/turisti-info/aktiviteetit">Kaj Lundberg</a>, who works as a fishing guide in summer and welcomed us to his house. We told us about the story of the island while we drunk hot coffee and ate Pulla, and then it was time to see more of Jurmo. We ten bloggers sat on a small trailer which Kaj pulled with his Quad, and so we went and climbed the Watchtower, took a stroll on the frozen Baltic and had fun with the snow, before we returned for a tasty dinner of local fish and potatoes. Way too soon we needed to head back to the first of many ferry and Taxi rides which would bring us back to Mariehamn, where we would just have enough time to pack, eat supper and then head for the ferry back to Helsinki, where on the next day the <a href="http://www.nbe.fi">Nordic Blogger Experience</a>, the <a href="http://www.messukeskus.com/">MATKA fair</a> and many more bloggers would wait for a few exciting days - which you’ll read about soon!</p>

<h2 id="rjk">Röjk</h2>

<p>Jan dreamed up a great Range for 2017, and this time <a href="http://rojksuperwear.com">Röjk</a> goes Oriental. Linus was wearing the new garments already and they looked mighty fine, with smart details, comfortable &amp; functional materials, pretty colours and cool designs. The T-Shirts for Gals &amp; Guys are made from 60% Merino and 40% Modal and will set you back 75€ once they hit the stores. That’s pretty pricey, but just remember Rule 1: <em>Always look cool™</em>. </p>

<p>The highlight for me in the new range was the Atlas pants. They not just look great, but what really was amazing that the complete pants - from fabric over buttons to sewing - is made within a 45 km radius of Stockholm, Sweden. That’s pretty rad, especially considering the pants is a reasonable 135€. Well, the pants also look good, obviously, have a high stretch and are made from a bluesign-certified, environmental fabric. And that yellow hoody Linus is wearing underneath - that’s the Cordura Zippenhood, which is pretty durable and looks good, too.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24144796084/in/dateposted/" title="Röjk Atlas Pants"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1557/24144796084_4d91fe28f6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Röjk Atlas Pants" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Micropile Jacket is 40% lighter than the <a href="http://rojksuperwear.com/guys/guys-primaloft-bomberpile-cocoa.html">Primaloft Bomber Pile</a> and has 45% Primaloft Polyester in it. At 160€ it’s cheaper than its aforementioned big brother, and goes for a more casual look that works well for hiking &amp; trekking as well on a cold day in the office. </p>

<p>Finally, the Mounter Hoody. 15% Merino wool, 8% Elastane for stretchiness and the rest is Polyester which makes for a nice looking midlayer. The texture of the hoody is a bit like jersey fabric, which is interesting and something fresh. </p>

<h2 id="inov-8">inov-8</h2>

<p><em>What happens if you have a free half an hour on the ISPO, Hendrik?</em> Well, dear reader, there were very few free half hours on the ISPO but in one of those I was navigating the hallways of always and stumbled upon <a href="http://www.inov-8.com">inov-8</a>. As it was early on Sunday morning the booth wasn’t full yet so I was able to grab Matt, the Designer and a Marketing person and go through the new kit that will be coming in the near future. I even met an old acquaintance at the booth: The inov-8 Roclite 286 GTX, which will return just as it was. Woohoo!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24144726364/in/dateposted/" title="inov-8 Roclite 286 GTX"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1673/24144726364_178e666a48_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="inov-8 Roclite 286 GTX" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>But these fairs are not about meeting old friends, but the new kids on the block. The AT/C Thermoshell HZ is one of these, and at 223 g in Mens’ M with a 40 g/ m2 Polartec Alpha insulation it’s probably one of the lightest breathable insulation jackets on the market. It packs into its own pocket, has a deep zipper for venting and the Pertex Quantum shell keeps a cold breeze &amp; drizzle at bay while you’re running up the foggy fjells.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24405194939/in/dateposted/" title="inov-8 AT/C Thermoshell HZ"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1505/24405194939_aba2d72188_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="inov-8 AT/C Thermoshell HZ" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And because you might need a wee pack to put the AT/C Thermoshell HZ into when you’re up on the sunny summit, you might want to carry the RaceUltra Boa pack. This pack has an included Hydrapak reservoir which sits on your hips so the weight is lower, and you can adjust the fit via a Boa closure system. I quizzed Matt, the designer, about the durability of the Boa System and he had no issues during testing with it, so I’m looking forward to hear how other users will find this in use. Anyway. The Boa System lets you compress the reservoir and pack to your pack so it’s not bouncing around while you bomb down the trail. The 10 l main compartment packs all the gear you will need to carry on an Ultra, a large outside mesh pocket that can be accessed from the sides, loops for poles and small pockets in the front allow you to carry all you need. A soft cup and an emergency blanket are included in the pack, so it’s ready for races like the UTMB where these items are required.</p>

<p>Have you heard about this season where white stuff is on the ground? That’s the season the ArcticClaw 300 Thermo and ArcticClaw 300 were made for. These replace the good old OROC and have more carbide spikes for even more grip, which are also re-arranged to give more grip (= spikes) under the fore-foot. The difference between these two shoes is that the Thermo has an additional Primaloft lining, so you can keep on running and hiking in very cold weather without your toes complaining! A Standard fit makes them great choices for those with wide feet, while the ArcticTalon 275 has a Performance Fit which is better for races. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24477310770/in/dateposted/" title="inov-8 ArcticClaw 300 Thermo"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1455/24477310770_fdb1a98251_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="inov-8 ArcticClaw 300 Thermo" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Also new is the X-Talon 225. I’m a huge <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/inov-8-x-talon-212-trailrunningschuhe-bf/?pid=10239">X-Talon 212</a> Fan, and the 225 has less cushioning than the 212 and is more durable, so should be a shoe which probably will be very popular with many ultralight backpackers. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24146042653/in/dateposted/" title="inov-8 X-Talon 225"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1519/24146042653_7de9396ff6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="inov-8 X-Talon 225" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24279252869/in/dateposted/" title="ISPO 2016 Impressions"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1509/24279252869_b07016a6f3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="ISPO 2016 Impressions" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>If you prefer more cushioning and a Standard Fit (= Wide Fit) then the X-Talon 200 will be a good choice. This X-Talon also has less cushioning as the 212 but the Standard fit will make it popular with those who find inov-8’s Performance fit just too constricting. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24144690094/in/dateposted/" title="inov-8 X-Talon 200"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1614/24144690094_472ae20891_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="inov-8 X-Talon 200" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The other popular shoes from inov-8 - like the Roclites - all got a face lift with some nice new graphics, while the TrailTalon 275 underneath is also one of those new kids. Made for long days on hard trails it sounds like a good shoe for hiking highways like the Kungsleden and PCT.</p>

<h2 id="rab">Rab</h2>

<p>Are you in need of a 1000 cuin jacket? Then get ready to save 500€ for the Zero G jacket from <a href="http://rab.equipment/">Rab</a>. At 310 g in Size L you really get a super-light jacket, which the Pertex Quantum GL 7d fabric and the 1000 cuin RDS certified down will be responsible for. It has a slim fit and alpine features like a helmet-compatible hood and two hand warmer pockets to store small items on the go.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24680351211/in/dateposted/" title="Rab Zero G Jacket"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1679/24680351211_3c6c890b79_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Rab Zero G Jacket" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>If you’re more concerned about your gear being waterproof <em>and</em> warm, then the Resolution Jacket will be for you. It has welded seams with a bonded box-wall construction for the hydrophobic 800 cuin down inside, and the relaxed fit means it’s a belay jacket you throw over while your mate climbs up the rime on Ben Nevis and a blizzard is pounding the mountain. A helmet compatible hood keeps your head warm and inside there’s large pockets to dump gloves and dry them out a tiny little bit. At 500€ you’ll also want to save for this one before it comes out later in 2016.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24145717834/in/dateposted/" title="Rab Resolution Jacket"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1510/24145717834_3a8c9f76a5_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Rab Resolution Jacket" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><em>So, was there any new material on the ISPO?</em> Good that you ask, Polartec Alpha Direct is indeed a new version of Polartec Alpha. The marketing spin: <em>“Alpha Direct has removed the inner lining, allowing moisture vapour to move quickly through the fibres and resulting in exceptional breathability and fast dry times when on the move.”</em> As a sweaty guy this sounds good to me, and the purple women’s colour also looks pretty good to me. A slim fit and two zippered hand pockets and stretchy fleece cuffs make it a comfy jacket for those who move fast in the mountains but don’t want to shed/ put on layers every few hundred meters.</p>

<p>Say <em>Hello</em> to Merino+, the re-launched MeCo. <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2012/11/hoodylicious.html">Hoodies are great</a> and the Merino+ 160 Hoody certainly looks the deal. It is 279 g in Size L (so even lighter in my Size S!), has thumb loops, a deep zipper for dumping excess heat and flat seams which are more comfortable under a backpack and layers. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24145766714/in/dateposted/" title="Rab Merino+ 160 Hoody"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1594/24145766714_2176b6451a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Rab Merino+ 160 Hoody" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And then there still was the Asylum Jacket. It’s 270€ and a jacket to keep you warm at the crag and blocs. Nice stretchy wrist gaiters keep the hands warm and the great colours go well with Rule 1. Very large internal mesh pockets allow you to keep your <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2014/06/scarpa-stix.html">climbing shoes</a> toasty inside your jacket while you belay or spot your mate. At 1.016 g it certainly ain’t light, but then that’s seldom a concern when you stand at the crag. Filled with hydrophobic, RDS-certified 650 cuin down.</p>

<h2 id="haglfs">Haglöfs</h2>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24146213123/in/dateposted/" title="Haglöfs Booth - Beat The Elements"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1556/24146213123_14e08d91f8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Haglöfs Booth - Beat The Elements" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a href="http://www.haglofs.com/">Haglöfs</a> is worth a visit for a growing number of oudoor enthusiasts, from skiers over mountaineers to hikers and urban folks who like to dress in a way that they can go out in a blizzard. The Selja Jackets underneath are from the 19Fourteen range, and are 3-in-1 jackets that are bluesign® approved with a 3L Gore-Tex shell jacket and a liner jacket which has a Pertex® Eco shell fabric and QuadFusion+™ insulation. Both jackets - liner and shell - can be used on its own or then easily clipped together. The jackets have some technical features like a storm flap behind the zipper and an adjustable hood. I do like the clean &amp; sophisticated look, though the weight of 1.110 g in Size L is pretty heavy. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24655091662/in/album-72157661680650583/" title="Haglöfs Selja Jackets"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1699/24655091662_c2eaa7f8eb_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Haglöfs Selja Jackets" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Couloir Jacket (Men’s in Orange, Women’s in Purple) is a hybrid garment which combines Gore-Tex C-knit with a softshell material. It’s made for freeriding but Haglöfs thinks it is also good to use for trekking and mountaineering. It weighs 605 g in Size L (Women’s 510 g in M), with a snap-away snow skirt, pit zips, articulated sleeves for freedom of movement and an adjustable hood. There’s a matching pants - the Couloir Pant - which weighs 615 g in Size L for the Men’s - and is made from 3L Gore-Tex Softshell material with the standard Schoeller Keprotec patches at the inside of the lower leg. A nice looking combination for the skiers out there. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24405303199/in/album-72157661680650583/" title="Haglöfs Couloir Ski Jackets"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1572/24405303199_00b95ca66e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Haglöfs Couloir Ski Jackets" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And then there was lightweight warmth and weather protection, too! The Spitz Jacket on the right (and the opener photo) is a Gore-Tex Pro Jacket and a got an update for the 2017 season. It got reinforcements in the shoulder, sleeve, back and hip sections for durability, Pit zips for venting and large pockets to store gear on the go. The jacket is shorter now to not interfere with your harness and is 490 g in Size L. </p>

<p>The Essens Mimic Hood is insulated with synthetic QuadFusion™ Mimic which mimics down but is beter in wet conditions. There’s on chest pocket and two zippered hand warmer pockets on the jacket, with the hood having a formable peak and of course it can be adjusted, too. The pictured Women’s model will be 210 g in Size M, while the Men’s version without hood will tip the scales at 260 g in L. </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Superfoods are since the invention of Soylent all the rage, and I have been fascinated by them since I read about them. When <a href="http://ambronite.com">Ambronite</a> asked me if I’d like to test their all-natural, Vegan Supermeal I said yes and decided to have a wee experiment with it: Living only on Ambronite for a week. This is my journey into the world of superfoods.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24366924076/in/dateposted/" title="Ambronite Supermeal"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1676/24366924076_88ab534832_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Ambronite Supermeal" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="the-perceived-convenience-of-supermeals">The (perceived?) convenience of Supermeals</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.soylent.com">Soylent</a> and it’s copies <a href="https://www.joylent.eu/">Joylent</a>, <a href="https://jakefood.com/">Jake</a>, <a href="http://huel.com">Huel</a> and <a href="http://mymana.eu/">Mana</a> are the <em>Food Revolution</em>. Made for busy office workers who want to work more and not needing to go out to shop, cook, and clean the dishes these meals want to give you more time to pursue the things you like to do - be it working, partying or hiking. The idea did appeal to me since I read about Soylent, so it was easy enough to agree to test <a href="http://ambronite.com">Ambronite</a>. The Start-up from Finland has a Twist on their Supermeal, though: It’s only made from natural ingredients - there’s no chemicals or artificial ingredients in it, only good things from nature. That’s very appealing, but is also represented in their price - they are easily the most expensive option of those named. But as I normally already pay a premium for local &amp; organic food, this would not be a big thing for me - plus I like to support Finnish Start-ups!</p>

<p>My usual diet is 95% Vegetarian (we eat meat &amp; fish once every other week). I usually eat a slice of bread or two with cheese and some veggies for breakfast, together with a cup of coffee and water. At Lunch we eat the leftovers from the previous day, afternoon coffee is the 2nd cup of coffee &amp; some pastry or fruit. Around 17 o’clock I might or might not eat a snack (fruit or bread) and around 19 o’clock we have dinner together. In the evening while watching a series we eat some more fruits. My wife and me cook each two days in a row, then it’s the other’s turn. It’s a system that works well for us, and I normally don’t spend more than an hour in the kitchen in the evenings to prepare food and less than an hour shopping the day before my turn. So all in all I might spend a maximum of 1,5 hours grocery shopping and 3,5 hours cooking in the evenings, with maybe an hour of cleaning the kitchen. Six hours a week - six hours which I now could use for something else. If that is worth it for you to forgo real food - only you yourself can know, and at the end of the article you can order a free pouch of Ambronite and safe time &amp; gain convenince (or lose out on a tasty lunch).</p>

<h2 id="ambronite-outdoors">Ambronite Outdoors</h2>

<p>The Outdoor Aspect of Ambronite comes in when looking at the numbers: A pouch weighs 126 g (120 g powder), has 500 kcal a portion and a massive load of Vitamins and Minerals. It is easy to prepare in the included bottle - add water &amp; powder, shake, drink - and it should be possible to prepare it in a 1l Nalgene. The cheapest option is to subscribe to Ambronite, then a meal will be 7,60€ - a one-off package of ten will make your wallet 89€ lighter (or 8,90€ per meal). I can see it be useful as breakfast or lunch, especially if you have set yourself a long distance to hike and don’t want to stop to eat. Ambronite can be prepared and eaten on the go, and washing the dishes is as easy as rinsing the bottle - all very convenient. Because of the high amount of Vitamins and Minerals it also could help to keep you healthy on a long tour - but normal Vitamin-pills can that too. I would not go outdoors backpacking or ski-touring and eat only Ambronite. The weight to Calorie Ratio isn’t that good, plus it would be very expensive. But one as lunch would be OK. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24310678221/in/dateposted/" title="Ambronite Supermeal"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1693/24310678221_6f5451162f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Ambronite Supermeal" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="living-on-1500-kcal-a-day">Living on 1.500 kcal a day</h2>

<p>One pouch of Ambronite has 500 kcal, and the recommended daily intake for a non-active human is 2.000 kcal. The energy value of the orange juice I added is 45 kcal per 100 ml, and the <a href="http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/beverages/3898/2">kcal value of coffee</a> is 2 per cup - so could say I had an energy intake of ~1.600 kcal a day. I found this interesting because on a normal day it’s hard to quantify the energy intake, and even with a healthy diet like mine the chance of “over-eating” is possible. I wanted to see, in a controlled environment, how it would be to live under the recommended daily intake value. That’s why I also didn’t mix it with any other ingredients - like cocnut or soy milk, bananas oe berries, or spices like honey and cinnamon.</p>

<p>This week I was out cycling, skiing and walking (average of 4,5 km a day), training at home, working and just doing normal daily stuff. During the mornings and afternoons I never felt hungry after a Supermeal Shake, but around 16, 17 o’clock a wee bit of hunger would appear on the first three days. That would get away once the third shake went down, but around 22 o’clock I again got a hungry feeling during the first three days. Well, so much about this - lets jump in to the experiment!</p>

<p><strong>Something to keep in mind: Taste is subjective. What I find OK you might find terrible - or delicious.</strong></p>

<h2 id="day-1">Day 1</h2>

<iframe width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T8XDzF7zLjw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>The first Ambronite Supermeal shake. This first one was with 550 ml water only, and it was OK in taste, grainy, thick and in my opinion very neutral in flavour, possible with a light Black Currant and Spinach after-taste. I expected it to taste much worse after reading <a href="http://hillplodder.com/2015/11/10/can-we-have-gruel-instead/">Matthew’s take on it</a> but was happy that it was for me good enough to get down. It kept the hunger away for the claimed four or five hours and in the afternoon I had my second Ambronite shake - this time mixed with some Orange Juice, which for me improved the taste considerably. In the afternoon I went to the supermarket with the family - to accompany them. I got a bit hungry over there - all the fresh fruits looked very good - but once at home it wasn’t there anymore. I had my third Ambronite sitting at the table while my family ate their delicious dinner, and I drunk the final shake. Later in the evening - I usually eat fruits in the evenings while watching something - I started to get hungry. Once in bed and asleep all was good though.</p>

<h2 id="day-2">Day 2</h2>

<p>I didn’t wake up starving as one might expect, going to bed slightly hungry. The shakes all went down fine today, I was drinking them rather slowly over the matter of an hour or so, but the evening meal I drunk in a matter of minutes. After the kids were sleeping and we were watching a series I again was getting a slightly hungry feeling, but once in bed I was fast asleep. </p>

<h2 id="day-3">Day 3</h2>

<iframe width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DqWh7uQRNsA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>All three meals went down easily without problems, and again there was a light hunger in the evening. </p>

<h2 id="day-4">Day 4</h2>

<iframe width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rt2wIysP-hQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Early breakfast, cycling out to the Baltic to have fun (and shot the above video) and a late Lunch outside - Ambronite didn’t freeze at the -6°C we had, but then I was only two hours outside. Dinner with the family. Surprisingly my body probably must have adjusted to the reduced energy intake, as I didn’t feel hungry at all in the afternoon or evening. </p>

<h2 id="day-5">Day 5</h2>

<p>The last breakfast of this experiment, and it wasn’t easy to get it down. Maybe it was that after having drunk this same-tasting shake now for five days that the taste buds were resenting the same taste, all the time. Not really looking forward to the Lunch and Dinner shakes either - I’ll update this post when they’re down the throat</p>

<h2 id="ingredients--taste">Ingredients &amp; Taste</h2>

<p>You can read the complete list of ingredients <a href="http://ambronite.com/pages/ingredients">here</a>. They are all natural, organic, GMO-free and Vegan, which I find great as it is in line with what I value in my food. The taste thus: It’s really hard to describe this, but neutral, thick (depending on the amount of water you use) and with a light Black Currant and Spinach after-taste would be my take on it. As Ambronite can taste differently between harvests it might be that yours tastes slightly different, too. It is not a taste which I am looking forward to, but more try to get it down as fast as possible - probably an effect of only eating it this week.</p>

<h2 id="weight-loss-focus-and-tiredness">Weight-loss, Focus and Tiredness</h2>

<p>I’m slim and lean at 63 kg normal weight. I’m certainly underweight (some 15 kg or so) but never gain more weight than 67 kg. It’s always been this way, and I don’t complain. So Ambronite was not a way for me to lose weight, and from what I can guess I didn’t lose any during this week. I have been working at 100% the whole week and was always focussed, and also was not more tired. All in all I would say I feel just as with my usual diet. Also bowel movement was normal, though went down from twice to once a day. I’ll save you further details on this =)</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/23764935714/in/dateposted/" title="Ambronite Supermeal"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1539/23764935714_881ae77d65_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Ambronite Supermeal" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h2>

<p>I am very much looking forward to my first real meal again tomorrow morning. As I say in my video from Day 4, it has shown me that the perceived convenience of these powdery Superfoods is too little for me to give up eating real food. I can see me using it on trips as lunch because of the convenience, but would not use it as a sole source of food - I like my MYOG Müslis and warm evening meals. At home I could see it come in handy on a busy day for lunch, but not just yet =) All in all I was happy to have had the possibility to try this experiment. I thought - reading about Soylent et al. - that this could indeed be the future. </p>

<p>And maybe for some it is. But for me it won’t be - certainly not as something that I eat for breakfast, lunch, dinner and a snack every day. There’s a few reasons for that: It’s prohibitive expensive to only eat Ambronite - the cost for a week (if you drink 4 meals a day) would be 226,95€, which would run up to 907,90€ a month (for 120 meals). That’s for one person, in a family of three that’s a ridiculous amount of money - plus I doubt my four year old son would drink this. As a family we spent between 600 and 800€ a month on high-quality food (lots of veggies and fruits, mostly organic &amp; local if possible), which is quite a bit less than what it would cost to feed one person just on Ambronite. </p>

<p>Another reason is that I do like real food. I like to cook (on trips in a bag), I don’t mind the shopping too much and the dishwasher does most of the cleaning. It’s also the social aspect of sitting together and eating something tasty. Or going to a Café on the weekend to eat some tasty waffles or a piece of cake. Going to a restaurant with friends &amp; family. Even as I was single I was cooking every day, often having friends over for dinner. The idea that everyone is just sitting there with a shake and trying to get it down - well, it feels a bit boring. </p>

<p>That said, there probably will be people who don’t mind the costs or perceived loss of real food. For those Ambronite &amp; its competitors will be an interesting way to experience the future of foods. As for me, I’m having a tasty Brunch in Helsinki tomorrow =)</p>

<p>Finally, you can <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1n39hqCQKCMR34_gtnrPOHOth2n9CMOQzFOg9p_jgH-c/viewform">try Ambronite for free</a> - enter your details and use the code “GETSAMPLE” and you’ll get one free Ambronite pouch sent to your door step. If you like it and want to order more, you can use the Coupon Code “HIKINGINFINLAND” and get 20€ off your order. </p>

<p>Hi everyone, I’m Vincent – I’m an outdoor and adventure photographer currently based in Hamburg, Germany. I’ve known Hendrik for a while now and earlier this year he asked me if I was interested in testing one of the rather new photo bags from <a href="http://www.thule.com/">THULE</a> and share my observations with him. Sure! The following are my impressions after having used the <a href="http://www.thule.com/en/fi/products/bags-and-cases/camera-bags-and-cases/camera-backpacks/thule-perspektiv-backpack-_-tl_85854227995_v2">Thule Perspektiv Backpack</a> on several outings from May to November.</p>

<p>Thule is a brand that most people including me probably still associate with transportation solutions for cars - mostly bike racks and roof cargo carriers. But their portfolio is indeed more versatile than that. The company was founded in 1942 in Sweden and has gone public in 2014. A couple years ago Case Logic was acquired by the Thule group and by around 2010 Thule started selling bags under their own brand. First general purpose bags, followed by bike bags and since 2013 photo bags. There’s toploaders, shoulder bags and backpacks and the Perspektiv Backpack is the biggest of the lot and it’s the one I chose to use. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/23580477964/in/dateposted/" title="Thule Perspektiv Backpack 02"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1639/23580477964_9508d57290_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Thule Perspektiv Backpack 02" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>When I carry more than just minimal camera equipment out of the house there’s two basic scenarios:</p>

<ol>
  <li>For everything that takes place close to a car or similar, Peli cases offer a bombproof pack-and-forget mode of transportation but are obviously not supposed to be carried around for too long.</li>
  <li>On longer, self-sufficient outings in the backcountry where you have to bring all gear and food for up to 2-3 weeks I try to stay as light as possible and look for solutions that enable me to access camera gear at any time without having to set down the backpack which would be time consuming and annoying. Plus, it needs to be not only waterproof but watertight in case I trip during a river crossing. I usually end up with a selfmade chest-carry solution in this scenario. </li>
</ol>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24208684595/in/dateposted/" title="Thule Perspektiv Backpack 03"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1645/24208684595_9f663daa8f_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Thule Perspektiv Backpack 03" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>There is a broad range of use cases in the gap between these two extremes for photography backpacks like the Thule Perspektiv. They are thus not designed for one specific purpose only but serve a multitude of demands by different users or different outings. The general purpose of course is to carry a reasonable camera system, accessories such as filters, batteries and a tripod as comfortably, flexible, organized and safely as possible. Safety is a function of impact resistance, water and dust repellency and theft protection. When it comes to traveling to and from your destination by plane or train the additional option to carry a laptop offers the benefit of having all your expensive, fragile belongings in one place right next to you. For this purpose the bag’s dimensions should allow it to be taken aboard as carry-on luggage. Key Features include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rigid, stable construction with water-repellant face fabric</li>
  <li>Holds 1-2 pro DSLRs and a couple lenses including 70-200 2.8 class.</li>
  <li>Fits a 15“ Macbook Pro</li>
  <li>Carries a tripod in the front or in the side pockets</li>
  <li>Multitude of pockets to organize gear.</li>
  <li>Dimensions (ext): 53x33x26cm</li>
  <li>Weight: 2+kg</li>
</ul>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/23581875363/in/dateposted/" title="Thule Perspektiv Backpack 04"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1459/23581875363_18b356e4ba_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Thule Perspektiv Backpack 04" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I won’t indulge in a detailed description and discussion of materials or technical details - the product shots from the <a href="http://www.thule.com/en/fi/products/bags-and-cases/camera-bags-and-cases/camera-backpacks/thule-perspektiv-backpack-_-tl_85854227995_v2">manufacturer</a> provide a good overview about how it is conceived. What I’d like to concentrate on instead is how that translates into practical application for me. </p>

<p>What struck me first was the structural integrity. It shows a level of rigidity that I was surprised to see in a soft-case. Especially the base of the bag is extremely solid. In conjunction with the tough, water-repellant face fabric and welded seams it certainly provides a lot of confidence. The three exposed zippers (with pull cords) have waterguards like you find on many hardshells. They are for sure not permanently waterproof but they provide a significant barrier that should be enough for most downpours. It is not a drybag and thus not watertight but I never really bothered to put on the supplied rain cover (that is conveniently stored within the pack) even during hours in the rain. With many backpacks that offer a high degree of water-repellency, the weakest point probably is the backside where water may enter between the pack and the user’s back. To mitigate the problem Thule opted for some sort of rain flap that covers the underlying main zipper and thus the vulnerable backside to some degree. In short: I personally would not worry too much about water coming in if the pack is not submerged. Which is really good!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/23581875453/in/dateposted/" title="Thule Perspektiv Backpack 05"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1712/23581875453_25fbf3251c_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Thule Perspektiv Backpack 05" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>There’s two main compartments. In the top you’ll find a small stable box-like compartment that is handy for keys, mobile phone, accupack, a snack or anything that you’d like to be able to access without having to open the main compartment. It’s nice. The main compartment is being accessed via the backside so you need not worry about thieves behind your back. Plus if you rest the pack in a puddle of mud the side that gets in contact with your back stays dry and clean. In the outdoors that does not matter but there may be some cases in civilization where it is beneficial. A padded laptop sleeve is integrated into the lid. The hip belt is attached to the lid – to fully open it you have to pull the zipper around one of the hip belts. Not a problem per se but worth mentioning.</p>

<p>Within the main compartment you’ll find the usual user-adjustable velcro interior in bright blue - which is nice. On the inside of the lid you’ll find two clear pockets with a lot of space for cables, filters and stuff. Inside one of the pockets there’s even CF and SD card mini-pockets that are attached via velcro. I store my cards in a crash and waterproof case so I never used these but it shows attention to detail that you’ll recognise in many small aspects such as the foam padded carry handle. Inside the main compartment the padding is rather stiff. People who are extremely careful with their gear might find it to be too thin and hard for their liking - It’s perfectly fine for me.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/23913103350/in/dateposted/" title="Thule Perspektiv Backpack 06"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1583/23913103350_69b2c41e77_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Thule Perspektiv Backpack 06" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The pack carries reasonably well. The stiff structure in conjunction with proper shoulder straps, a decent hip belt and some padding around the shoulders and the lumbar area create a good carrying system. The downside for me is that it’s one size. At 1.88m I’d say it’s a bit too small for my torso in backcountry backpack terms. It’s not too much of a problem here because the loads that are being carried are never excessive but it feels like the sizing somewhat deteriorates an otherwise well-conceived carrying system for taller people. You’ll have to find out for yourself by trying it.</p>

<p>The bag is designed strictly as a photo bag. All additional stuff you might like to bring with you, from a fleece jacket to food, water etc. has to fit inside the photo compartment (the two elastic outside pockets will hold 0.5 l each if you don’t have anything else attached to the sides). In this regard it is certainly not as flexible a system as F-Stop gear provides where backpack and camera storage are two separate items that can be combined depending on the mission to make room for e.g. overnight equipment. This of course limits the Thule to daypack-use - which is perfectly OK because it does really well in this regard and would otherwise sacrifice carry-on compatibility.
That does not mean that you can only carry camera equipment in there of course. Most of the time I had a camera body, 2.8 telephoto and super-wide-angle zooms and two fast primes with me. That leaves enough space for water, a few snacks, an insulation jacket and rain gear. Or for two jumars, Grigris and a couple carabiners and the climbing rope attached to the outside of the pack. While that might not be ideal is is entirely possible. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/24208685345/in/dateposted/" title="Thule Perspektiv Backpack 07"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1618/24208685345_5a981fa343_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Thule Perspektiv Backpack 07" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>So how do I break it down? Generally speaking the Thule Perspektiv Backpack meets very high standards when it comes to materials and construction. Everything has a quality feel to it and shows pleasant attention to detail. It offers all the protection, flexibility and carrying capabilities. On an aesthetic sidenote: The reduced, minimal, technical yet elegant design really appeals to me. However you load it it never shrinks or crumples but always stays rigid and tight. </p>

<p>Would I recommend it? If you don’t plan on going over night and need not bring huge loads of additional non-photographic gear then the Thule Perspektiv backpack is a premium choice that will serve you really well. Being able to carry everything of value – from camera to laptop in your carry-on luggage is a big plus. If you need a backpack for longer outings with overnight gear or a lot of technical gear, then you want to look somewhere else, because that’s just not what it was designed for. I really like it and I’d suggest you take it into consideration if you’re looking for a camera backpack for day-use. It certainly is expensive but features a sense of quality in concept, material and construction that I feel meets the asked price.

<p>This article waits since about four years in my drafts folder. Come November, December, it smiles at me. It says <em>“How about it, Hendrik? Should you take a one year break from getting new outdoor gear?”</em>. And I smile back at it, thinking <em>“You know, I’d love to. But I’m a gear editor at two magazines, so testing the latest and greatest is my job”</em>. And with that I put the thought ad actum, give this draft a new futuristic date, in the hope that the next year could be a <strong>No Gear Year</strong>. </p>

<p>Because honestly, I don’t need anything new. I have enough hardshells and trailrunning shoes, plenty of backpacks and shelters, as well as skis, climbing gear, a packraft and a Fatbike. Now I may be a gear editor at a climbing and at a backpacking magazine, but I’m sure there’s just as many normal outdoor enthusiasts out there who have cupboards full of gear. Much of it only getting used a handfull of times a year, with the owner eyeing the new version already while the one on the shelf is still perfect.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/18493538621/in/dateposted/" title="Friday&#x27;s Outdoor Office"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/410/18493538621_e46dd8d195_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Friday&#x27;s Outdoor Office" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And who is to blame? Outdoor shops pretty much have a 20% off sale on a weekly basis, there’s winter, summer and Black Friday sales where shiny new kit is smiling at us at so deep prices - and lets be honest, we really needed that 10 g lighter rain jacket because it will make our skin-out weight significantly lighter. And that new 9.1 mm single rope was needed because it will help me to send my 7c project. That new, inflatable pillow surely will be the last pillow I ever need as I will sleep like at home on it, and those new trailrunners will make me hike faster and be great for training, too. And it was all on sale, too - how could I resist?</p>

<h2 id="money-spent-passionately-on-trips-not-gear">Money spent passionately on trips, not gear</h2>

<p>That lovely headline I copied some four years ago into this draft. As I was pondering last year to buy a new camera and spend a significant amount on it and lenses a friend commented <em>“Why not use what you have, take the money and go on a trip to shoot great photos?”</em>. <em>“Ah well”</em>, I said, <em>“you know, it is not that easy with a house and family”</em>. But the more I thought about it, the more it just seemed like one of those easy excuse phrases. Sure, it is more difficult to travel with a baby and a four-year-old - but it is not impossible as an increasing number of dads &amp; moms show when they go outdoors with their toddlers &amp; kids.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/14856100147/in/album-72157645045051650/" title="Hiking in the rain"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5586/14856100147_5784882629_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Hiking in the rain" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Spending money on gear is a lot easier than going somewhere, I get it. Browse your favourite outdoor shop, see that there’s something new and it’s for such a good price - click, click, click and another package will be arriving soon. Put it on or up in the garden, maybe snap a photo and you even would have material for a new blog post - if you’re a blogger, that is. But going on a trip? </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don’t buy more than you need. Because if you do, you are going to consume way more than the resources of the planet can bear. - Rose Marcario, CEO Patagonia</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, that involves planing. Planing a route, the food, gear, getting there, having a look on the weather, etc. You also need to actually go outside, and what if it is -13°C and snowing like here right now? Well, that ain’t particularly pleasant, especially with all that grey sky which makes for less than ideal photo weather. But isn’t that actually what we have all the gear for? Down jackets, softshell pants, warm shoes - they’d be great for this weather, and as they haven’t been used yet (enough), why not take them out for a walk or even a Microadventure?</p>

<h2 id="join-me-in-a-year-without-new-gear">Join me in a year without new gear</h2>

<p>It’s nothing new. <a href="https://sweepingthegarden.wordpress.com/2012/01/02/no-new-gear-2012/">Craig has done it in 2012</a> and still loves to go outdoors. If a gear nerd like me whose job it is to test &amp; review the latest and greatest outdoor gear can do it, I’m sure you too, my esteemed reader, also can do 12 months without new gear. No new backpacking gear, no new bike, no new climbing gear, no new shoes, no new shelter - <strong>NO NEW GEAR</strong>. Personally I also include used gear in this, but that’s your call really. And twelve months are not that long - I just got used to write 2015 when noting down the date, and now it’s already 2016 - so a year without new gear will be faster over than you think.</p>

<p>And think about all the benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Next year, in 2017, you can splurge on the latest and greatest outdoor gear, which will most certainly be better than in 2016!</li>
  <li>In 2016 you can actually test and use all the gear you have already!</li>
  <li>You can go on more trips, because you’ll save hundreds of €£$ on not buying new equipment and sitting in front of the computer!</li>
</ul>

<p>Exceptions for me will be food and fuel, these I will purchase as needed for my trips - and you should, too. Because hiking &amp; climbing on an empty stomach is no fun!</p>

<h2 id="repair-re-use-swap-loan---and-use-what-you-already-have">Repair, re-use, swap, loan - and use what you already have</h2>

<p>In case a piece of equipment fails you - socks can get holes in the heels, shoes get walked through, a shelter starts to leak, the waterproof jacket ain’t waterproof no more - you can just fix it. Bring your shoes to the cobbler to get a new sole on them, wash your waterproofs to make them keep the snow &amp; rain out again, seam-seal your shelter and use the best repair tape of all time to fix everything else: Duct tape! </p>

<p>Still feel the urge to try something new in 2016? You can always loan gear - from friends, companies or websites - to try a new outdoor hobby, from packrafts over a SUP board to a Via ferrata set - there’s no need to own it if you just want to try it. Imagine you don’t like skiing after the first few tries, but you got skiing gear standing there for 2.000€? Loan before you own. </p>

<h2 id="get-out-adventuring">Get out adventuring!</h2>

<p>The bottomline for this move is for me two-fold: I want to Simplify my life further and show that one doesn’t need to chase the latest sale on gear. It’s more fun to go and chase the sunset with a light backpack on, which is what this pastime is all about: Spending time outdoors. Good outdoor gear helps, but we shouldn’t chase it more than spending time outside. So here’s to twelve months of no new gear, and more outdoor adventures!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>You know what winter is for? Ski-touring. Backcountry Ski-touring, Hut-to-Hut Ski-touring and early morning laps before work. <a href="http://www.mammut.ch">Mammut</a> makes since many years many essential pieces of kit for ski-touring enthusiasts, and the <a href="http://www.mammut.ch/INT/en/B2C-Category/Equipment/Avalanche-Safety/Avalanche-Airbags/Ride-Removable-Airbag/p/2610-01100-0055-130">Ride Removable Airbag Backpack</a> is a complete all-mountain and freeride backpack with the Removable Airbag System R.A.S. included. The 30l backpack weighs just 2.560 g and fits enough gear for a long day in the mountains, while the Removable Airbag System can be used also with other compatible backpacks or removed when not needed. There’s a front pocket for avalanche safety equipment, an anatomically padded back and removable hipbelt, and skis or a snowboard can be carried in the front. It’s a might fine pack and Airbag System that helps to keep one safe during those crazy El Niño winters where it dumps a meter of snow a night and you can’t wait to earn your turns the next morning. With this pack and my avalanche awareness knowledge I will be safer from a possible avalanche - now how about that snow for the holidays?</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>sometimes it feels I’m repeating myself. For example when I’m talking about the benefits of vests for backpacking, skiing and other outdoor pursuits. Take the <a href="http://www.vaude.com/en-FI/Products/Clothing/Men-s-Sulit-Insulation-Vest-black.html">Sulit Vest</a> from <a href="http://www.vaude.com/">Vaude</a> for example: The PrimaLoft® Silver Eco Insulation keeps you toasty warm in any weather and moisture isn’t a big problem for it either. It’s ideal when hiking in cold autumn rain for extra warmth or when skinning up the mountain during the early hours of the day. When it’s not needed it packs away small in your pack. And to top things off, the garment is bluesign® certified and carries Vaude’s Green Shape label, both a guarantee that this is a truly environmentally friendly garment. So all in all a truly useful piece of clothing that accompanies one from spring to winter on all outdoor trips.</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p><a href="http://wildernessthreadworks.com/">Wilderness Threadworks</a> builts their small line of high-quality products in Australia, and their <a href="http://wildernessthreadworks.com/products/sonder-30l-pack">Sonder 30 L Backpack</a> is the item of my desires today. With 30 l volume it’s an ideal size for ultralight backpackers who go out for a week and a dayhike alike. The XPac material is highly water-resistant and the rolltop closure allows for packing the pack totally full with many days of food or small &amp; light for a summit push. Two side pockets take the water bottles, integrated hip belt pockets store the camera and snacks and in the front the trekking poles or ice axes can be carried. The design is simple, beautiful and perfect for bushwhacking and climbing - in short, an excellent pack for adventures off the beaten track!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>all this wishing and explaining ultralight gear to you has gotten me hungry. Hungry for some tasty meals from <a href="http://www.trekneat.com">Trek’n Eat</a>, like the Trek’n Eat Veggie Jambalaya, Chicken Tikka Masala and Salomon pesto with Pasta. Tasty and fulfilling meals that will make the belly of any climber, skier or backpacker full, be it in Scandinavia or New Zealand. Of course it would make sense to have a stove which works across the globe with these meals, too. A stove like the <a href="http://www.optimusstoves.com/en/ch/8-8019229-polaris-optifuel">Optimus Polaris Optifuel</a> which burns White gas, LP Gas, Gasoline, Kerosene, Diesel and even Jet fuel - when you’re realizing after landing with your bush airplane in Alaska that you forgot to pack fuel, you just can take some out of the plane’s tank! The stove has a 4 Season Mode for cold temperatures and an Efficiency Mode for when its balmy outside. It packs small and comes with a host of accessories, which makes it ideal for those who want just one stove to do it all!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>It might be winter, but that doesn’t mean I can’t think ahead for spring, summer and autumn when lighter kit will be the norm. Kit like the <a href="http://www.jacksrbetter.com/">Jacks ‘R’ Better</a> <a href="http://www.jacksrbetter.com/shop/sierra-stealth/">Sierra Stealth Quilt</a>, which is filled with high-quality 800 cuin hydrophobic Activ-dri down™ and weighs a mere 470 g! It’s a quilt which means it’s super-easy to get under, ventilate - and the best thing: Thanks to the head hole it doubles as a sarape at camp, allowing me to leave a down jacket at home! It’s also useful when getting up in the morning is difficult - just slip the head through the hole and you can wear this toasty warm quilt while waiting for the coffee and Müsli to be ready. While on the trail it packs down to the size of a grapefruit and so fits even into the smallest daypack!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>a small and compact backpack is a beautiful thing: It carries everything you need for a dayhike, fits on a plane and also works to carry your Mac to work. The <a href="http://marmot.com/products/details/kompressor-verve-26">Kompressor Verve 26</a> from <a href="http://www.marmot.de">Marmot</a> is such a backpack: At 770 g its pretty light, and the D-shaped zipper allows for full access to the content inside. A single Trekking Pole Attachment carries the poles or axe during scrambles, mesh side pockets hold the water bottles and a lid pocket stores wallet, keys and snacks on the go. The pack is slim and from durable materials, which makes it an ideal companion for cragging, exploring and urban adventures - thus all the things I have planned for 2016! </p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>You know what’d be useful? A sleeping bag in which I can walk around camp in the morning, pushing that moment where I need to leave my lofty cocoon behind just a bit further away. I guess that’s what the designers of the <a href="http://www.haglofs.com/gb/en/Sleeping-Bags/L-I-M-DOWN-%2B1/p/416040.2C5">L.I.M DOWN +1 sleeping bag</a> at <a href="http://www.haglofs.com/">Haglöfs</a> where thinking, too, because really: There’s nothing more difficult than getting out of a cozy warm sleeping bag in the morning, especially if it is cool outside. And filled with bluesign® certified 800 cuin goose down the L.I.M DOWN +1 sleeping bag is going to be toasty warm, while the open foot end with cord closure allows me to walk around in camp to put the kettle on the stove and get the circulation running. And at just 493 g it weighs so little that it doesn’t slow me down once I start hiking. Also the packsize is tiny and so fits in any backpack - you see this is the ideal sleeping bag for us ultralight hikers who have difficulties getting out of the bed in the morning!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.nomadicstovecompany.com">Nomadic Stoves Company</a> builds its stove in Alaska by hand, and in the winter it can get -60°C where Jeff and his wife live - a place thus where you appreciate fire. It is thus no wonder that they know how to build wood stoves, and their <a href="http://www.nomadicstovecompany.com/#!/our-stoves/trekker/">Trekker Stoves</a> are mighty fine wood stove indeed. Jeff did his Apprenticeship with <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2009/11/interview-fritz-handel-from-bushbuddy.html">Fritz from BushBuddy</a> and now builds his Trekker stoves in three different configurations - the Regular stove and two Ultra stoves which are even lighter. All three burn super efficient and clean with any sort of combustible material - from wood to pine cones and bark, the Trekker stoves allows you to go ultralight by leaving heavy fuel canisters and bottles at home &amp; enjoying the beauty of a wood fire in a save manner!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The second big news from last weeks <a href="http://arcteryx.com">Arc’teryx</a> media event in Vancouver was the launch of the Voltair Avalanche Airbag. As I was able to use and deploy it over three days in the Canadian backcountry what follows are more insights on this game-changing avalanche airbag.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/23716165196/in/dateposted/" title="Arc’teryx Designer Gord Rose skiing with his creation, the Voltair Avalanche Airbag"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5734/23716165196_6633e02f0d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Arc’teryx Designer Gord Rose skiing with his creation, the Voltair Avalanche Airbag" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="the-tech">The Tech</h2>

<p>No, it has no similarities with the JetForce Technology. Both are powered by a battery, but that’s already what these two technologies have in common. And the Arc’teryx Voltair Avalanche Airbag battery allows the bag to be deployed up to 8 times on a fully charged battery, which is two times as often as the Jetforce lets you deploy the ballon. It’s even more at warmer temperatures, and less at -30°C - but then again, not many will be out skiing at -30°C. </p>

<p>Gordon Rose started to dabble in Avalanche packs around ten years ago, but the Voltair project started in February 2010 for real. Since then Gordon and his colleague Peter Hill, who is responsible for the backpack part of the Voltair, have been working on this avalanche pack. The inspiration for Gordon came from RC Models - he and a colleague where talking about how fast model planes can go, the short comings of compressed gas airbag, and saw possibilities of RC Technology for avalanche bags. Gordon went through many tests of propellor and centrifugal blowers until he settled on a mixed flow centrifugal blower. Advanced Design Technology in London, UK, helped him and Arc’teryx design the optimal propellor and after 21 designs and tests they had the perfect one for their pack. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/23447243040/in/dateposted/" title="Gordon Rose with the tech guts of the Voltair Avalanche Airbag"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5798/23447243040_c612e0e1b1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Gordon Rose with the tech guts of the Voltair Avalanche Airbag" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The next step was to get the battery right. Gordon settled on a Lithium Polymer battery design as these work well at cold temperatures and are the most efficient. Powertraveller helped design and manufacture the battery, and the one in the Voltair now allows you to deploy the ballon up to 8 times at -15°C - more at warmer temperatures, less at -30°C. The benefit of this should be obvious: It allows you to practice to deploy the airbag. If you know how it behaves, you’re less likely to hesitate to pull the trigger and deploy the ballon. Each of us popped the ballon a couple of times in a test environment, and then up in the mountains again. In the case of an avalanche this means you don’t wait and pull the trigger and deploy the ballon. The battery is charged via a cable and goes from empty to full in 2,5 hours, and weighs 800 g - a weight that Arc’teryx hopes to improve in the future. </p>

<p>For the release trigger Arc’teryx decided to use a mechanical system - while the possibility to use an electronic system is tempting, they decided in harsh conditions there’s just too much which can go wrong with a electronic release, and a reliable pull trigger is the best way to go. The Trigger is easy to unlock, but even in a locked position it is easy to release the ballon with just a small twist. The trigger is custom-molded and easy to grip with mitts and gloves, and connects via a steel cable to the ballon compartment. A pull on the trigger pops the closure open, this in turn connects to an electronic trigger which starts up the centrifugal blower which inflates the ballon in less than five seconds.</p>

<p>The next design hurdle was the Brushless DC Motor, which are difficult to make reliable at cold weather. After tracking down many designers across the globe Gord found the right guy just five minutes from the Arc’teryx Design HQ, and he helped him design a reliable engine which also performs at -30°C. 90% of the other technology in the pack is also custom-made, from flexible wires to the circuit board and release notch, Arc’teryx spent nearly six years to make this backpack the best in its category. To learn more, please watch this exclusive video where Gordon Rose and Peter Hill talk about the Voltair Avalanche Airbag:</p>

<h2 id="the-pack">The Pack</h2>

<p>The goal of Peter Hill was to make a classic, timeless Arc’teryx backpack which still looks great in five years. Constructed from the AC² material with taped seams and glued-in Sidewinder zippers, the pack is waterproof and keeps your gear dry. As it rained &amp; snowed all the time as we were up in the mountains it was a good test for the pack, and it performed great: Everything stayed dry inside. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/23633782422/in/album-72157662401963745/" title="Arc’teryx Voltair Avalanche Airbag - Side"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5797/23633782422_324efe2db1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Arc’teryx Voltair Avalanche Airbag - Side" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Voltair has three compartments: A ballon compartment, an avalanche Kit compartment and a main compartment. Available in two sizes these pack are real 20 l and 30 l packs, unlike some packs of competitors which barely let you pack a puffy jacket and thermos bottle in their claimed volumes. I carried in my 30 l test pack two extra pairs of gloves, my <a href="http://bit.ly/1P2NxEx">Arc’teryx Cerium SV Jacket</a>, my <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/norroena-lyngen-alpha100-vest-kunstfaserweste/?pid=10239">Norrona Lyngen Alpha100 Vest</a>, a water bottle, sandwiches and snacks, my <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/contour-hybrid-mix-130-skifelle/?pid=10239">countour Hybrid skins</a>, a tripod, two cameras and I had plenty of room to spare. If I compare that to my <a href="https://www.bergzeit.co.uk/black-diamond-dawn-patrol-25-ski-rucksack-deep-torch-black-m-l/?pid=81">Black Diamond Dawn Patrol 25 pack</a> that’s a massive difference, where it gets pretty hard to get so much gear in. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/23716247456/in/album-72157662401963745/" title="Avalanche Kit Pocket"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/738/23716247456_a1a40505f3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Avalanche Kit Pocket" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The carrying system of the Voltair is very comfortable and is fully adjustable. The hipbelt has some freedom of movement so you can turn those hips for your turns, and if you want to save weight you can remove the stays. The hipbelt also can be turned around for transport, and the chest strap can be removed if you feel you don’t need it. The leg loop strap is very easy to use which is very important: It’s the piece of gear that ensures you stay connected to the backpack and ballon if you get into an avalanche. It is super easy to clip in and out - also with mitts on - and the design is inspired by ice clippers as you might know them from ice climbing. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/23742317785/in/album-72157662401963745/" title="Leg loop clip-in point"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5829/23742317785_aa47814a51_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Leg loop clip-in point" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The pack isn’t ultralight, even if Arc’teryx tried to use the lightest &amp; most durable materials and technology in the pack. The 20 l pack is 3.235 g and the 30 l pack is 3.465 g - the tech inside is a big part of that, with the battery itself already being a wee bit over 800 g. Arc’teryx hopes that this weight will be decreased in the not-too-distant future, especially since major players are heavily infesting into energy storage solutions.</p>

<h2 id="in-use">In Use</h2>

<p>I was able to use the pack for three days out at <a href="http://www.callaghancountry.com">Callaghan Country</a>, which gave me a good understanding how this pack carries and deploys. The first thing you realize is the comfortable carrying system, which carries also (for an ultralight backpacker) very well, even with a pretty full pack. Also the leg loop is wonderfully intuitive and unobtrusive: It clips in and out super easy even with thick gloves on, and you don’t realize it is there while skinning and skiing. </p>

<p>As I haven’t used Avalanche Airbags before I have nothing to compare the Voltair to, but chatting with Lou of <a href="http://wildsnow.com">Wildsnow</a> and my other colleagues at the event it became evident that the Voltair is a well-designed Avalanche backpack which compares very good with other packs in the market. The advantages of battery-powered packs in comparison to compressed air backpacks are evident: You can practice and test the release of the ballon at home, it is much easier to travel with as you don’t need to find a place to fill up the air cartridge before you hit the slopes at your destination, and being able to release the ballon in the Voltair up to eight times means using this pack on long outings adds a lot of safety. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/23659988171/in/album-72157662401963745/" title="Packing the Ballon 1"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5703/23659988171_0fef0d05d5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Packing the Ballon 1" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Packing the ballon is a thing of two to five minutes, depending on your level of practice. The ballon deflates via a valve which you slide in. Happily the ballon does not need to be folded in a special way - just stuff it back into the ballon compartment, close the zipper, pop the hatch back in and you’re ready. I discussed at length with Peter and Gordon about the use of zippers for the ballon compartment as it’s most certainly the thing I like least, but as every other avalanche pack on the market uses zippers (they work!) and in a pinch you can use the ballon even if the zipper is broken, I am convinced that it is OK. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/23115555973/in/album-72157662401963745/" title="Ballon compartment"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/579/23115555973_03b5921fd9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Ballon compartment" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Putting the system on and releasing the ballon is also easy. You put the battery on and get a re-assuring short whirr which means the system is on and ready to go. The green LED lamp at the outside will blink green indicating that all is good to go, then you just turn the handle to the green dot side and you’re ready to skin up and ski down. In the case of an avalanche you pull the trigger and <em>POP!</em> the ballon deploys, helping you to hopefully stay on top thanks to the inverse segregation principle, which sorts larger particles to the top of the avalanche. The handle of the Voltair is also always accessible and can not be stowed away, this again minimizes the risk of user error and is different from other avalanche packs.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/23742279705/in/album-72157662401963745/" title="POW Turns"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5814/23742279705_0876730dd4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="POW Turns" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>You can carry skis/ snowboard and an ice axe at the front of the pack, just make sure to put the ice axe with the tip down (ballons and steel tips don’t work well together). The side compression straps help to minimize volume if you are out with a small load, and the front hipbelt is comfortable and carries well. All buckles are easy to open in cold weather with gloves, and the zippers have tabs which makes them easy to operate with gloves on.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/23374347639/in/album-72157662401963745/" title="Crossing streams"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/654/23374347639_0df435ac5f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Crossing streams" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Finally, the battery and control unit of the circuit collect data of the pack in use, with the aim to further the knowledge base of avalanche airbags in use. This data can be downloaded - should the user agree - when the pack is sent in for inspection. Arc’teryx works close together with Pascal Haegeli of the Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, one of the premier avalanche researchers on the planet. </p>

<h2 id="the-bottomline">The Bottomline</h2>

<p>The Voltair is a beautifully designed avalanche pack which is spacious and easy to use. The tech inside is all custom-made and designed to the highest standards, so that it can operate at -30°C and for many years in the harsh conditions of the backcountry. It is easy to learn how to deploy the ballon, pack it back in and then carry all your gear on your backcountry ski-tours. Fully waterproof it keeps your kit inside dry, and the possibilities for human error minimized it hopefully helps you to survive an avalanche if you should ever get into one. The packs will retail for 1650€ for the 30 l pack and 1550€ for the 20 l and will be available in autumn 2016. <em>Of course using the pack for just three days is not enough for a long-term review, but I am confident that with a sample pack showing up hopefully soon I can put it through its paces during the many ski-touring trips I have planned for this winter and then can get a more detailed review up by spring.</em></p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p><a href="http://www.elementalhorizons.com/kalais-pack/">Kalais</a> is in Greek mythology the son of <a href="http://www.elementalhorizons.com/aquilo-pack/">Aquilo</a>, and the new Kalais pack from <a href="http://www.elementalhorizons.com">Elemental Horizons</a> is literally the smaller and lighter “son of Aquilo.” At 850 g and a volume of 47 l it carries plenty of gear for short winter trips and long summer hikes alike. The side mesh pockets store water bottles, a jacket and snacks while the V-Stay Lite Suspension System ensures it carries very well - and it is even compatible with a bear canister! The combination of Dyneema X grid stop fabric and 70d rip stop nylon makes it light &amp; durable, ready for bush-whacking in Alaska or scrambling in the Lake District. Made in the USA the Kalais is made to order, and should be hear just in time for the first trip of 2016!</p>
