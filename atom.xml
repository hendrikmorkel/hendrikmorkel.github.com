<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>You know what winter is for? Ski-touring. Backcountry Ski-touring, Hut-to-Hut Ski-touring and early morning laps before work. <a href="http://www.mammut.ch">Mammut</a> makes since many years many essential pieces of kit for ski-touring enthusiasts, and the <a href="http://www.mammut.ch/INT/en/B2C-Category/Equipment/Avalanche-Safety/Avalanche-Airbags/Ride-Removable-Airbag/p/2610-01100-0055-130">Ride Removable Airbag Backpack</a> is a complete all-mountain and freeride backpack with the Removable Airbag System R.A.S. included. The 30l backpack weighs just 2.560 g and fits enough gear for a long day in the mountains, while the Removable Airbag System can be used also with other compatible backpacks or removed when not needed. There’s a front pocket for avalanche safety equipment, an anatomically padded back and removable hipbelt, and skis or a snowboard can be carried in the front. It’s a might fine pack and Airbag System that helps to keep one safe during those crazy El Niño winters where it dumps a meter of snow a night and you can’t wait to earn your turns the next morning. With this pack and my avalanche awareness knowledge I will be safer from a possible avalanche - now how about that snow for the holidays?</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>sometimes it feels I’m repeating myself. For example when I’m talking about the benefits of vests for backpacking, skiing and other outdoor pursuits. Take the <a href="http://www.vaude.com/en-FI/Products/Clothing/Men-s-Sulit-Insulation-Vest-black.html">Sulit Vest</a> from <a href="http://www.vaude.com/">Vaude</a> for example: The PrimaLoft® Silver Eco Insulation keeps you toasty warm in any weather and moisture isn’t a big problem for it either. It’s ideal when hiking in cold autumn rain for extra warmth or when skinning up the mountain during the early hours of the day. When it’s not needed it packs away small in your pack. And to top things off, the garment is bluesign® certified and carries Vaude’s Green Shape label, both a guarantee that this is a truly environmentally friendly garment. So all in all a truly useful piece of clothing that accompanies one from spring to winter on all outdoor trips.</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p><a href="http://wildernessthreadworks.com/">Wilderness Threadworks</a> builts their small line of high-quality products in Australia, and their <a href="http://wildernessthreadworks.com/products/sonder-30l-pack">Sonder 30 L Backpack</a> is the item of my desires today. With 30 l volume it’s an ideal size for ultralight backpackers who go out for a week and a dayhike alike. The XPac material is highly water-resistant and the rolltop closure allows for packing the pack totally full with many days of food or small &amp; light for a summit push. Two side pockets take the water bottles, integrated hip belt pockets store the camera and snacks and in the front the trekking poles or ice axes can be carried. The design is simple, beautiful and perfect for bushwhacking and climbing - in short, an excellent pack for adventures off the beaten track!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>all this wishing and explaining ultralight gear to you has gotten me hungry. Hungry for some tasty meals from <a href="http://www.trekneat.com">Trek’n Eat</a>, like the Trek’n Eat Veggie Jambalaya, Chicken Tikka Masala and Salomon pesto with Pasta. Tasty and fulfilling meals that will make the belly of any climber, skier or backpacker full, be it in Scandinavia or New Zealand. Of course it would make sense to have a stove which works across the globe with these meals, too. A stove like the <a href="http://www.optimusstoves.com/en/ch/8-8019229-polaris-optifuel">Optimus Polaris Optifuel</a> which burns White gas, LP Gas, Gasoline, Kerosene, Diesel and even Jet fuel - when you’re realizing after landing with your bush airplane in Alaska that you forgot to pack fuel, you just can take some out of the plane’s tank! The stove has a 4 Season Mode for cold temperatures and an Efficiency Mode for when its balmy outside. It packs small and comes with a host of accessories, which makes it ideal for those who want just one stove to do it all!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>It might be winter, but that doesn’t mean I can’t think ahead for spring, summer and autumn when lighter kit will be the norm. Kit like the <a href="http://www.jacksrbetter.com/">Jacks ‘R’ Better</a> <a href="http://www.jacksrbetter.com/shop/sierra-stealth/">Sierra Stealth Quilt</a>, which is filled with high-quality 800 cuin hydrophobic Activ-dri down™ and weighs a mere 470 g! It’s a quilt which means it’s super-easy to get under, ventilate - and the best thing: Thanks to the head hole it doubles as a sarape at camp, allowing me to leave a down jacket at home! It’s also useful when getting up in the morning is difficult - just slip the head through the hole and you can wear this toasty warm quilt while waiting for the coffee and Müsli to be ready. While on the trail it packs down to the size of a grapefruit and so fits even into the smallest daypack!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>a small and compact backpack is a beautiful thing: It carries everything you need for a dayhike, fits on a plane and also works to carry your Mac to work. The <a href="http://marmot.com/products/details/kompressor-verve-26">Kompressor Verve 26</a> from <a href="http://www.marmot.de">Marmot</a> is such a backpack: At 770 g its pretty light, and the D-shaped zipper allows for full access to the content inside. A single Trekking Pole Attachment carries the poles or axe during scrambles, mesh side pockets hold the water bottles and a lid pocket stores wallet, keys and snacks on the go. The pack is slim and from durable materials, which makes it an ideal companion for cragging, exploring and urban adventures - thus all the things I have planned for 2016! </p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>You know what’d be useful? A sleeping bag in which I can walk around camp in the morning, pushing that moment where I need to leave my lofty cocoon behind just a bit further away. I guess that’s what the designers of the <a href="http://www.haglofs.com/gb/en/Sleeping-Bags/L-I-M-DOWN-%2B1/p/416040.2C5">L.I.M DOWN +1 sleeping bag</a> at <a href="http://www.haglofs.com/">Haglöfs</a> where thinking, too, because really: There’s nothing more difficult than getting out of a cozy warm sleeping bag in the morning, especially if it is cool outside. And filled with bluesign® certified 800 cuin goose down the L.I.M DOWN +1 sleeping bag is going to be toasty warm, while the open foot end with cord closure allows me to walk around in camp to put the kettle on the stove and get the circulation running. And at just 493 g it weighs so little that it doesn’t slow me down once I start hiking. Also the packsize is tiny and so fits in any backpack - you see this is the ideal sleeping bag for us ultralight hikers who have difficulties getting out of the bed in the morning!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.nomadicstovecompany.com">Nomadic Stoves Company</a> builds its stove in Alaska by hand, and in the winter it can get -60°C where Jeff and his wife live - a place thus where you appreciate fire. It is thus no wonder that they know how to build wood stoves, and their <a href="http://www.nomadicstovecompany.com/#!/our-stoves/trekker/">Trekker Stoves</a> are mighty fine wood stove indeed. Jeff did his Apprenticeship with <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2009/11/interview-fritz-handel-from-bushbuddy.html">Fritz from BushBuddy</a> and now builds his Trekker stoves in three different configurations - the Regular stove and two Ultra stoves which are even lighter. All three burn super efficient and clean with any sort of combustible material - from wood to pine cones and bark, the Trekker stoves allows you to go ultralight by leaving heavy fuel canisters and bottles at home &amp; enjoying the beauty of a wood fire in a save manner!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The second big news from last weeks <a href="http://arcteryx.com">Arc’teryx</a> media event in Vancouver was the launch of the Voltair Avalanche Airbag. As I was able to use and deploy it over three days in the Canadian backcountry what follows are more insights on this game-changing avalanche airbag.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/23716165196/in/dateposted/" title="Arc’teryx Designer Gord Rose skiing with his creation, the Voltair Avalanche Airbag"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5734/23716165196_6633e02f0d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Arc’teryx Designer Gord Rose skiing with his creation, the Voltair Avalanche Airbag" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2 id="the-tech">The Tech</h2>

<p>No, it has no similarities with the JetForce Technology. Both are powered by a battery, but that’s already what these two technologies have in common. And the Arc’teryx Voltair Avalanche Airbag battery allows the bag to be deployed up to 8 times on a fully charged battery, which is two times as often as the Jetforce lets you deploy the ballon. It’s even more at warmer temperatures, and less at -30°C - but then again, not many will be out skiing at -30°C. </p>

<p>Gordon Rose started to dabble in Avalanche packs around ten years ago, but the Voltair project started in February 2010 for real. Since then Gordon and his colleague Peter Hill, who is responsible for the backpack part of the Voltair, have been working on this avalanche pack. The inspiration for Gordon came from RC Models - he and a colleague where talking about how fast model planes can go, the short comings of compressed gas airbag, and saw possibilities of RC Technology for avalanche bags. Gordon went through many tests of propellor and centrifugal blowers until he settled on a mixed flow centrifugal blower. Advanced Design Technology in London, UK, helped him and Arc’teryx design the optimal propellor and after 21 designs and tests they had the perfect one for their pack. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/23447243040/in/dateposted/" title="Gordon Rose with the tech guts of the Voltair Avalanche Airbag"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5798/23447243040_c612e0e1b1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Gordon Rose with the tech guts of the Voltair Avalanche Airbag" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The next step was to get the battery right. Gordon settled on a Lithium Polymer battery design as these work well at cold temperatures and are the most efficient. Powertraveller helped design and manufacture the battery, and the one in the Voltair now allows you to deploy the ballon up to 8 times at -15°C - more at warmer temperatures, less at -30°C. The benefit of this should be obvious: It allows you to practice to deploy the airbag. If you know how it behaves, you’re less likely to hesitate to pull the trigger and deploy the ballon. Each of us popped the ballon a couple of times in a test environment, and then up in the mountains again. In the case of an avalanche this means you don’t wait and pull the trigger and deploy the ballon. The battery is charged via a cable and goes from empty to full in 2,5 hours, and weighs 800 g - a weight that Arc’teryx hopes to improve in the future. </p>

<p>For the release trigger Arc’teryx decided to use a mechanical system - while the possibility to use an electronic system is tempting, they decided in harsh conditions there’s just too much which can go wrong with a electronic release, and a reliable pull trigger is the best way to go. The Trigger is easy to unlock, but even in a locked position it is easy to release the ballon with just a small twist. The trigger is custom-molded and easy to grip with mitts and gloves, and connects via a steel cable to the ballon compartment. A pull on the trigger pops the closure open, this in turn connects to an electronic trigger which starts up the centrifugal blower which inflates the ballon in less than five seconds.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/23716201286/in/album-72157662401963745/" title="Release Trigger Locked"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/675/23716201286_fc4b267027_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Release Trigger Locked" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The next design hurdle was the Brushless DC Motor, which are difficult to make reliable at cold weather. After tracking down many designers across the globe Gord found the right guy just five minutes from the Arc’teryx Design HQ, and he helped him design a reliable engine which also performs at -30°C. 90% of the other technology in the pack is also custom-made, from flexible wires to the circuit board and release notch, Arc’teryx spent nearly six years to make this backpack the best in its category.

<p>The goal of Peter Hill was to make a classic, timeless Arc’teryx backpack which still looks great in five years. Constructed from the AC² material with taped seams and glued-in Sidewinder zippers, the pack is waterproof and keeps your gear dry. As it rained &amp; snowed all the time as we were up in the mountains it was a good test for the pack, and it performed great: Everything stayed dry inside. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/23633782422/in/album-72157662401963745/" title="Arc’teryx Voltair Avalanche Airbag - Side"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5797/23633782422_324efe2db1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Arc’teryx Voltair Avalanche Airbag - Side" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The Voltair has three compartments: A ballon compartment, an avalanche Kit compartment and a main compartment. Available in two sizes these pack are real 20 l and 30 l packs, unlike some packs of competitors which barely let you pack a puffy jacket and thermos bottle in their claimed volumes. I carried in my 30 l test pack two extra pairs of gloves, my <a href="http://bit.ly/1P2NxEx">Arc’teryx Cerium SV Jacket</a>, my <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/norroena-lyngen-alpha100-vest-kunstfaserweste/?pid=10239">Norrona Lyngen Alpha100 Vest</a>, a water bottle, sandwiches and snacks, my <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/contour-hybrid-mix-130-skifelle/?pid=10239">countour Hybrid skins</a>, a tripod, two cameras and I had plenty of room to spare. If I compare that to my <a href="https://www.bergzeit.co.uk/black-diamond-dawn-patrol-25-ski-rucksack-deep-torch-black-m-l/?pid=81">Black Diamond Dawn Patrol 25 pack</a> that’s a massive difference, where it gets pretty hard to get so much gear in. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/23716247456/in/album-72157662401963745/" title="Avalanche Kit Pocket"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/738/23716247456_a1a40505f3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Avalanche Kit Pocket" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The carrying system of the Voltair is very comfortable and is fully adjustable. The hipbelt has some freedom of movement so you can turn those hips for your turns, and if you want to save weight you can remove the stays. The hipbelt also can be turned around for transport, and the chest strap can be removed if you feel you don’t need it. The leg loop strap is very easy to use which is very important: It’s the piece of gear that ensures you stay connected to the backpack and ballon if you get into an avalanche. It is super easy to clip in and out - also with mitts on - and the design is inspired by ice clippers as you might know them from ice climbing. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/23742317785/in/album-72157662401963745/" title="Leg loop clip-in point"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5829/23742317785_aa47814a51_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Leg loop clip-in point" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The pack isn’t ultralight, even if Arc’teryx tried to use the lightest &amp; most durable materials and technology in the pack. The 20 l pack is 3.235 g and the 30 l pack is 3.465 g - the tech inside is a big part of that, with the battery itself already being a wee bit over 800 g. Arc’teryx hopes that this weight will be decreased in the not-too-distant future, especially since major players are heavily infesting into energy storage solutions.</p>

<h2 id="in-use">In Use</h2>

<p>I was able to use the pack for three days out at <a href="http://www.callaghancountry.com">Callaghan Country</a>, which gave me a good understanding how this pack carries and deploys. The first thing you realize is the comfortable carrying system, which carries also (for an ultralight backpacker) very well, even with a pretty full pack. Also the leg loop is wonderfully intuitive and unobtrusive: It clips in and out super easy even with thick gloves on, and you don’t realize it is there while skinning and skiing. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/23633780212/in/album-72157662401963745/" title="Arc’teryx Voltair Avalanche Airbag at Callaghan Country"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5702/23633780212_2243ce5e36_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Arc’teryx Voltair Avalanche Airbag at Callaghan Country" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>As I haven’t used Avalanche Airbags before I have nothing to compare the Voltair to, but chatting with Lou of <a href="http://wildsnow.com">Wildsnow</a> and my other colleagues at the event it became evident that the Voltair is a well-designed Avalanche backpack which compares very good with other packs in the market. The advantages of battery-powered packs in comparison to compressed air backpacks are evident: You can practice and test the release of the ballon at home, it is much easier to travel with as you don’t need to find a place to fill up the air cartridge before you hit the slopes at your destination, and being able to release the ballon in the Voltair up to eight times means using this pack on long outings adds a lot of safety. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/23659988171/in/album-72157662401963745/" title="Packing the Ballon 1"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5703/23659988171_0fef0d05d5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Packing the Ballon 1" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Packing the ballon is a thing of two to five minutes, depending on your level of practice. The ballon deflates via a valve which you slide in. Happily the ballon does not need to be folded in a special way - just stuff it back into the ballon compartment, close the zipper, pop the hatch back in and you’re ready. I discussed at length with Peter and Gordon about the use of zippers for the ballon compartment as it’s most certainly the thing I like least, but as every other avalanche pack on the market uses zippers (they work!) and in a pinch you can use the ballon even if the zipper is broken, I am convinced that it is OK. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/23115555973/in/album-72157662401963745/" title="Ballon compartment"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/579/23115555973_03b5921fd9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Ballon compartment" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Putting the system on and releasing the ballon is also easy. You put the battery on and get a re-assuring short whirr which means the system is on and ready to go. The green LED lamp at the outside will blink green indicating that all is good to go, then you just turn the handle to the green dot side and you’re ready to skin up and ski down. In the case of an avalanche you pull the trigger and <em>POP!</em> the ballon deploys, helping you to hopefully stay on top thanks to the inverse segregation principle, which sorts larger particles to the top of the avalanche. The handle of the Voltair is also always accessible and can not be stowed away, this again minimizes the risk of user error and is different from other avalanche packs.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/23742279705/in/album-72157662401963745/" title="POW Turns"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5814/23742279705_0876730dd4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="POW Turns" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>You can carry skis/ snowboard and an ice axe at the front of the pack, just make sure to put the ice axe with the tip down (ballons and steel tips don’t work well together). The side compression straps help to minimize volume if you are out with a small load, and the front hipbelt is comfortable and carries well. All buckles are easy to open in cold weather with gloves, and the zippers have tabs which makes them easy to operate with gloves on.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/23374347639/in/album-72157662401963745/" title="Crossing streams"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/654/23374347639_0df435ac5f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Crossing streams" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Finally, the battery and control unit of the circuit collect data of the pack in use, with the aim to further the knowledge base of avalanche airbags in use. This data can be downloaded - should the user agree - when the pack is sent in for inspection. Arc’teryx works close together with Pascal Haegeli of the Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, one of the premier avalanche researchers on the planet. </p>

<h2 id="the-bottomline">The Bottomline</h2>

<p>The Voltair is a beautifully designed avalanche pack which is spacious and easy to use. The tech inside is all custom-made and designed to the highest standards, so that it can operate at -30°C and for many years in the harsh conditions of the backcountry. It is easy to learn how to deploy the ballon, pack it back in and then carry all your gear on your backcountry ski-tours. Fully waterproof it keeps your kit inside dry, and the possibilities for human error minimized it hopefully helps you to survive an avalanche if you should ever get into one. The packs will retail for 1650€ for the 30 l pack and 1550€ for the 20 l and will be available in autumn 2016. <em>Of course using the pack for just three days is not enough for a long-term review, but I am confident that with a sample pack showing up hopefully soon I can put it through its paces during the many ski-touring trips I have planned for this winter and then can get a more detailed review up by spring.</em></p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p><a href="http://www.elementalhorizons.com/kalais-pack/">Kalais</a> is in Greek mythology the son of <a href="http://www.elementalhorizons.com/aquilo-pack/">Aquilo</a>, and the new Kalais pack from <a href="http://www.elementalhorizons.com">Elemental Horizons</a> is literally the smaller and lighter “son of Aquilo.” At 850 g and a volume of 47 l it carries plenty of gear for short winter trips and long summer hikes alike. The side mesh pockets store water bottles, a jacket and snacks while the V-Stay Lite Suspension System ensures it carries very well - and it is even compatible with a bear canister! The combination of Dyneema X grid stop fabric and 70d rip stop nylon makes it light &amp; durable, ready for bush-whacking in Alaska or scrambling in the Lake District. Made in the USA the Kalais is made to order, and should be hear just in time for the first trip of 2016!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p><a href="http://astucas.com/">As Tucas</a> is making since a couple of years ultralight gear of the highest quality close to the beautiful Pyrenees in Spain. They’re brand-new <a href="http://astucas.com/millaris-bivy-sack">Millaris Bivy Sack</a> is the latest addition of their line-up, and this weather-resistant bivy is a great addition to their quilts. The waterproof bathtub bottom and windproof top will keep you dry and toasty, while the half-length zipper makes for easy and comfortable entry. Of course it is ultralight, too: Tipping the scales at 175 g in L size it’s a serious contender for the lightest bivy bag award, which means it can always be along, for climbing trips in the Dolomites, packrafting trips in Lapland or backpacking adventures in Spain!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>Winter is dark, and November and December are by far the darkest months. Light is essential for outdoor adventures in the winter, be it for trailrunning, cycling. climbing or backpacking. A good thing that <a href="http://www.suprabeam.com/uk/index.html">Suprabeam</a> helps us see and bee seen in the darkness: The <a href="http://www.suprabeam.com/uk/products/v4pro-rechargeable">V4pro rechargeable Headlamp</a> is a powerful headlamp which with its 800 Lumen lights up the trail ahead, and the Lithium-Polymer battery can easily be recharged. With a distance of up to 250 m you can see far ahead in the dark, and at just 195 g it is so light that you won’t notice it when you wear it. The best of all is of course that it allows me to continue to be active in the dark - even if sitting in front of a log fire can be fun, too!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>trekking poles are for ultralight backpackers more than just trekking poles - they’re multiuse items which help you solve multiple problems. During the day they help you hike more efficient in the mountains going up and down, but at camp they pitch your tarp or shelter. The <a href="http://rutalocura.com/trekking_poles.html">Yana Poles</a> from <a href="http://rutalocura.com/">Ruta Locura</a> can do more, too: With the optional Clarkii Rod the Yana pole transforms into a tenkara fishing rod, and the optional Camera mount allows you to leave a tripod at home and use your trekking poles instead. The Yana poles are the lightest poles on the market at 105 g per pole, and they’re adjustable in length, too. Beautiful to look is the carbon material they’re made of, and so versatile in use that every ultralight backpacker should have a pair.</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>sometimes it is difficult to decide what one needs. Sure, we have thousands of wants, but what we really need is more limited. This does connect directly to ultralight backpacking, too: Sure a Five Person Double-Wall tent with wood stove is nice to have, but one does not need it for a solo trip. A tarp or <a href="http://www.outdoorline.sk/en/tents/357-hyperlite-mountain-gear-ultamid-2-pyramid-shelter.html">Pyramid shelter</a> makes much more sense. So it is nice to get some starting capital at <a href="http://www.outdoorline.sk/en/">Outdoorline.sk</a> to fulfil these real needs - be they a nice cuben shelter, a warm down quilt or a new hardshell. And as Outdoorline.sk carries great gear from ultralight brands you know it will be a good investment for something you need, want, and really will use!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/23233644179/in/dateposted/" title="Arc&#x27;teryx Procline Carbon Boot"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5694/23233644179_77ae9e38a8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Arc&#x27;teryx Procline Carbon Boot" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I was lucky enough to witness on Monday afternoon the unveiling of the <a href="http://arcteryx.com">Arc’teryx</a> ski boot line. It was a much rumoured development and what we saw today was even better than what the rumors suggested. As I have a severe Jetleg I will just make this a short and sweet post with some key points, and after (possibly maybe) having used the boot a bit more over the following few days up in the mountains I will update this post, so please stay tuned. It is smart to follow along on <a href="http://facebook.com/hikinginfinland">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/hendrikmorkel">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://instagram.com/hendrikm/">Instagram</a> as with some luck there will be live updates from the mountains about this boot and the new Voltair Avalanche Airbag there, too.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/23519476391/in/dateposted/" title="Arc&#x27;teryx Procline Carbon Boot"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/709/23519476391_c5e65555f2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Arc&#x27;teryx Procline Carbon Boot" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Coming in Fall 2016 are the <strong>six alpine touring ski boots from Arc’teryx</strong>, and together with eight colleagues from Europe and North America I am heading out to test these new boots and the Voltair Avalanche Airbag over the next three days so I will be able to give more insights on those on Friday. Here’s what I can tell you from trying on the boot and checking it out today at the exclusive product launch. The Six models are called </p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Procline Carbon Lite</strong>, the top of the line Unisex model which tips the scales at 1.190 g and will cost 730€ retail. </li>
  <li>The <strong>Procline Carbon Support</strong> will be 1.260 g in MP Size 27.5 abd costs 700€</li>
  <li>The <strong>Procline Men’s Lite</strong> will be 580€, 1.190 g in MP Size 27.5 while the <strong>Procline Men’s Support</strong> is 1.260 g and 550€</li>
  <li>The <strong>Procline Women’s Lite</strong> tips the scales at 1.060 g and the <strong>Procline Women’s Support</strong> is 1.120 g - prices are the same as the Men’s models but both have a women’s last</li>
</ul>

<p>The difference between the Lite and Support models are the liners and cuffs. The Lite liners are about 90 g lighter as the support liners and fully thermo-mouldable. Both liners are designed in-house, but are different: The <em>Lite Liner</em> is made for uphill agility and great if you have a talented ski boot fitter at hand, while the <em>Support Liner</em> is slightly better for ski performance and if you don’t have access to a ski boot fitter. The Support Liner also has, as the name suggests, more tongue and collar support. The Women’s model will have a women’s last, and all liners have a removable strap closure system. </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/23306141770/in/dateposted/" title="Arc&#x27;teryx Procline Carbon Boot"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5788/23306141770_d7edb81816_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Arc&#x27;teryx Procline Carbon Boot" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The special thing about the boot - besides the ridiculously light weight of 1.190 g for the Procline Carbon Lite - is the agility it gives you. The 360° Rotating Cuff makes the boot feel more like the <a href="https://hikinginfinland.com/2015/01/scarpa-rebel-ultra-gtx.html">Scarpa Rebel Ultra GTX</a>. Unlike normal cuffs this cuff - available in two different configurations, one from Carbon fibre with over-injected Grilamid and in the Men’s and Women’s models the cuff is made from carbonfibre charged Grilamid  - is cut in half. Yes, you read that right: The cuff is cut in half in the back of your calf. Together with the rest of the cuff his gives you a <strong>Lateral rotation of 23° inwards and 13° outwards</strong>, which should make it much more better for skinning up difficult, steep snow or make it more agile for climbing.</p>

<p>Speaking of alpine climbing, one of the re-occurring points the designer <strong>Federico Sbrissa</strong> (keep that name in mind, I have a feeling we can expect much more great footwear innovations to come from him!) made is that these boots were <em>designed for the alpinists and also great for every ski-tourer</em>. It’s a point worth thinking about, because the things alpinist (climbers) want in boots often will be much appreciated by skiers. I mean, more agility in your boot that allows you to skin longer and keep the crampons in your pack? Great! More edge control on steep snow traverses? Yes please! More agility when using crampons? Heck yeah! </p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendrikmorkel/23234109229/in/dateposted/" title="Arc&#x27;teryx Procline Carbon Boot"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/583/23234109229_7920fba1dc_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Arc&#x27;teryx Procline Carbon Boot" /></a><script async="" src="http://hikinginfinland.com//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Nice about these carbon fibre cuffs is also that the pivot points - the places where metal rivets go through them - are made from plastic. And they connect to plastic. Which makes them a lot more durable than 100% carbon cuffs, which tend to wear out at the points where they touch metal. As here plastic touches plastic, they should last much longer, which is pretty cool. Once you decide to ski pull the buckle down and can hit the pow. Locking pins on the divided cuff lock into the rear spine and you have a nice, stiff boot to go down.</p>

<p>The other great innovation - well, there’s many more, but I have that jetleg and tomorrow’s another long day - is the full coverage gaiter. Made from Cordura with a PVC coating it is waterproof, a thing that both climbers and skiers will appreciate: If you climb ice in boots you don’t want ice or water coming in, and on Champagne Powder days you neither want snow in your boot, be it skinning up or shredding down. This gaiter, which is integrated with the boot shell, gives you a lot of protection and toasty feet in any conditions, be it skiing down or climbing up.</p>

<p>The Hybrid Closure System is a mix of buckle and lacing - think a Boa® closure that actually stays shut. The buckle is integrated with the cable, has 15 different positions for adjustment for an individual fit, and as the cable is connected to the buckle - once the buckle is locked in, it stays put! The cable is made from steel and the buckle from aluminium, and it is pretty amazing how well you can adjust the fit on these. </p>

<p>There’s a lot more - a Power Strap without Velcro, buckles that keep in place when opened, a rockered tow, Dynafit certified toe and heel inserts, a crampon optimized toe shape with rubber cover and a Vibram sole - but I’ll tell you more about these on Friday.

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>70 meters can be short - or long if we’re talking about a Pitch on the Cassin. That you don’t want to go with a short rope climbing is clear, so the <a href="http://www.bergfreunde.de/beal-zonsi-101-bergfreunde-edition-einfachseil/">70 m Beal Zonsi 10.1 Single Rope in the Bergfreunde Edition</a> is a much better choice - be it for climbing the project at the home crag, train lead climbing at the gym or visit Turkey for some fine limestone climbing. At 10.1 mm diameter it can take a lot of abuse, and the weight of 63 g/ m is very reasonable for such a durable rope. The great handling and compatibility with most belay device is just another plus point for this long rope, and with 70 meters of rope you can climb Kantti at Olhava top to bottom! </p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p><a href="http://www.naturebase.de">Nature Base</a> is a small cottage from Germany which uses innovative materials to create unique products. One of these is their <a href="http://www.naturebase.de/shop/pulka">ultralight folding pulka</a> - at 490 g it’s 1/10 the weight of the lightest normal pulkas, with the difference that the folding pulka rolls up to a wee roll and so is super-easy to transport in trains, busses and planes! Once you’re up in the fjells of Lapland, you can roll it out &amp; strap your backpack to it, attach the pulling cables to yourself and start snowshoeing, hiking or skiing. If the terrain doesn’t allow for pulling - for example if you’re scrambling up steep hills - you can easily put your pack with the pulka attached to it on and go up! It’s a universal tool that makes travelling in winter more convenient and fast, so an excellent choice for ultralight backpackers and winter adventurers alike!</p>

<p>Dear Santa,</p>

<p>Spring, summer, autumn and winter are the four seasons for us outdoor enthusiasts, and over twelve months they give us many reasons to go outside and enjoy the hills and nature. Sure, sometimes conditions might not be best - but a bit of rain, snow and wind hasn’t harmed anyone yet. Except, of course, the garments we wear: Daily use gets them dirty and stained, and often they lose the properties of protecting us from rain and wind. A good thing that <a href="http://nikwax.co.uk/en-us/">Nikwax</a> allows us to breath new functionality into our rain jackets, down coats, baselayers and shoes. <a href="http://nikwax.co.uk/en-us/products/productdetail.php?productid=268&amp;itemid=-1&amp;fabricid=-1">Tech Wash</a> and <a href="http://nikwax.co.uk/en-us/products/productdetail.php?productid=267&amp;itemid=-1&amp;fabricid=-1">TX.Direct Wash-In</a> make hardshell jackets ready for another season in the snow and rain, and <a href="http://nikwax.co.uk/en-us/products/productdetail.php?productid=1015&amp;itemid=-1&amp;fabricid=-1">Down Wash Direct</a> cleans hydrophobic &amp; regular down and restores the water repellency while maintaining their fill power &amp; insulation. The <a href="http://nikwax.co.uk/en-us/products/productdetail.php?productid=262&amp;itemid=-1&amp;fabricid=-1">Footwear Cleaning Gel</a> cleans trailrunners and hiking boots and revitalizes their breathability and water repellency, so that they are ready for more muddy trails in any season! And that’s not just great for the garments, but also for nature and us!</p>
